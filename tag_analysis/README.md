# Tag Analysis Scripts

This directory contains the final tag optimization tools for AlbumExplore.

## Current Status (Post-Phase 5)
- **Target achieved**: Reduced from 1,010 to ~597 unique tags (40.9% reduction)
- **Final approach**: Strategic ultra-aggressive optimization with high-confidence rules
- **All changes**: Backed up and reversible via tag_rules_backup_* files

## Essential Files

### Active Scripts
- `apply_phase5_strategic.py` - Final strategic optimization implementation

### Documentation  
- `COMPLETE_PROGRESS_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive progress summary
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference for tag optimization
- `README.md` - This file

### Backups
- `tag_rules_backup_phase3_*.json` - Phase 3 backup
- `tag_rules_backup_phase4_*.json` - Phase 4 backup  
- `tag_rules_backup_phase5_*.json` - Phase 5 backup (current state)

## Next Steps
1. Export and validate new tag counts
2. Test music discovery functionality  
3. Apply additional optimizations if needed
4. Monitor tag usage in production

## Rollback Instructions
To rollback to any previous phase:
```bash
cp tag_rules_backup_[phase]_[timestamp].json ../src/albumexplore/config/tag_rules.json
```

## Historical Context
This workspace has been cleaned of obsolete scripts from Phases 1-4 and early Phase 5 analysis.
All critical functionality is preserved in the final strategic optimization script.
