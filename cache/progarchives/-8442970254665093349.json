  "name": "BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO",
  "genre": "Rock Progressivo Italiano",
  "country": "Italy",
  "biography": "Founded in Rome, Italy in 1969 - Between 1997-2018 active playing Live - Reformed in 2016\n\nOne of the most important progressive rock bands to come from Italy, BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO, along with LE ORME and PFM are regarded as the big three of the RPI genre. This is not only because of their longevity and the level of success they achieved in their own country, but also because each were able to make considerable inroads abroad, something which didn't happen for most of their contemporaries.\n\nDespite not releasing their first album until 1972, the band actually formed in 1969, their sound centering around the virtuoso dual keyboard work of the Nocenzi brothers, Gianni and Vittorio. The early line-up fluctuated with various members coming and going before any recorded output was released, including drummers Franco Pontecorvi and Mario Achilli, bassist Fabrizio Falco and guitarists Gianfranco Coletta (ex CHETRO & CO) and Claudio Falco. This early incarnation of the band did, however, record some material but this wouldn't surface until 1989 (see the \"Donna Plautilla\" album).\n\nJoining the Nocenzi brothers for a more stable line-up in time for their first album was ex-FIORI DI CAMPO guitarist Marcello Todaro and three members of LE ESPERIENZE, vocalist Francesco Di Giacomo, drummer Pier Luigi Calderoni and bassist Renato D'Angelo. Their eponymous first album was a remarkably mature piece of inventive symphonic progressive rock with classical influences, featuring excellent musicianship and the emotionally charged vocal delivery of Di Giacomo. This was quickly followed up by the equally highly regarded \"Darwin\" and \"Io Sono Nato Libero,\" forming a trio of albums that are essential listening for anyone with even the most casual interest in the RPI genre.\n\nA change of guitarist followed shortly after the recording of \"Io Sono Nato Libero,\" when Todaro left and joined CRYSTALS and was replaced by Rodolfo Maltese, formerly of HOMO SAPIENS. Around this time the band attempted to make inroads outside their native Italy and released the English sung \"Banco\" on ELP'S Manticore label. In reality this was largely a compilation, as it consisted of re-recorded songs from their first three albums with the exception of one track. To promote this they toured the USA and UK with limited success. \"Banco\" was followed in 1976 by the film soundtrack album \"Garofano Rosso,\" and in the same year two versions of the same album, one Italian and one English, \"Come In Un'Ultima Cena\" and \"As In A Last Supper\" were released. 1978 saw the release of another all instrumental album \".Di Terra\", this time incorporating the use of an orchestra.\n\n\"Canto Di Primavera\" saw bassist D'Angelo being replaced by Gianni Colaiacomo, and after this the band entered a period that is probably of little interest to prog fans, moving in a more commercial pop direction. In 1983 Gianni Nocenzi was to leave the band, and the following years saw the coming and going of a number of musicians through a series of critically slated albums, at least amongst the prog community.\n\nSigns that the band may be returning to their prog roots came in 1991 when the band re-recorded their acclaimed first album and \"Darwin\". The lightweight pop/rock of \"Banco 13\", released in 1994 showed however that it was a little early to celebrate. No studio albums have appeared since 1996 but the band continued with sporadic live activity and released a number of live albums. Perhaps the most interesting of these is \"Seguendo Le Tracce\", which captures a stunning concert from 1975, reminding us how great this band can be. The most recent of these live albums is ''Quaranta'', a 2010 recording previously released as part of the Prog Exhibition box set. The then line-up comprised of vocalist Francesco Di Giacomo, on keyboards Vittorio Nocenzi, guitarists Rodolfo Maltese and Filippo Marcheggiani, drummer Maurizio Masi, bassist Tiziano Ricci and on sax, flute and clarinet Alessandro Papotto (PERIFERIA DEL MONDO). Sadly, Francesco Di Giacomo died following a road traffic accident on 21st February, 2014.\n\nBANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO, particularly the first three albums, is an essential early port of call for anyone looking to discover the RPI genre.\n\nPaul Fowler [Nightfly]",
