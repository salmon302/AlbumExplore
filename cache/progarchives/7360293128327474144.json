  "biography": "Harmonium biography\n\nFounded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1972 - Disbanded in 1977\n\nThis Quebec-based Progressive rock band, who sang in French, has a very apt name in HARMONIUM. The core was a folk trio formed by guitarists\n\nSerge FIORI\n\nand Michel NORMANDEAU, and bassist Louis VALOIS. Their career was short (five years) and they released three studio albums in the mid-Seventies and a posthumous live album. They started off as a jazzy and typically French folk trio but began to delve into more progressive material on their brilliant second album, \"Si on avait besoin d'une cinqui\ufffdme saison\" (\"If We Needed a Fifth Season\"). They are regarded as one of the finest exponents (along with POLLEN and MANEIGE) of the \"Golden Era of Quebec Progressive Music\" Scene.\n\n\"Harmonium\" is a \"folky\" album, but it contains progressive elements too. By their 2nd album, they were very much a cross between a symphonic rock band and a folk band; an interesting combination which you can hear most clearly on the 20-minute \"Histoire Sans Paroles\". Overall,  a perfect album to start your French Canadian prog collection. With \"L'Heptade\", they reached their symphonic/progressive zenith. In addition to the now increasingly large band, classical instruments and mellotron are used throughout. This elegant double album is a testament to the potential of the genre. Both are really satisfying; if you are a confirmed proggy-prog band head,to begin with. \"Harmonium en tourn\ufffde\" is an excellent live version of their conceptual work \"L'Heptade\". Fans of brave musical experiments and elegant songwriting could not be disappointed by HARMONIUM...!\n\nSee also:\n\nWiKi",
