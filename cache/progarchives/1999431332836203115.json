  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "biography": "Formed in 1972, split in 1983 and reunited between 1991 and 1995.\n\nSince 1999 a new version of the band has been touring but  no new recordings have been released.\n\nDeriving their name from the metric total of semen ejaculated by the average male, the tongue-in-cheek British art-pop band 10cc comprised an all-star roster of Manchester-based musicians. Vocalist/guitarist Graham Gouldman was a former member of The Mockingbirds and the author of hits for The Yardbirds, The Hollies, Herman's Hermits and Jeff Beck; singer/guitarist Eric Stewart was an alumn of Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders; and vocalists/multi-instrumentalists\n\nKevin Godley and Lol Creme\n\nwere both highly regarded studio players. All of them played on eccentric prog folk artist RAMASES' 1971 studio album \"Space Hymns\".\n\n10cc began in 1970 as a session unit dubbed Hotlegs; after establishing residence at Stewart's Strawberry Studios, Hotlegs scored a surprise U.K. smash hit with the single \"Neanderthal Man,\" subsequently issuing an LP, \"Thinks: School Times\", and touring with The Moody Blues.\n\nAfter signing to Jonathan King's U.K. label and rechristening themselves 10cc (a name suggested by King himself), the group backed Neil Sedaka before recording 1972's \"Donna,\" a sly satire of late-'50s doo-wop. The single reached Number Two on the British charts, establishing not only a long-running string of major hits, but also the quartet's fondness for ironic and affectionate reclamations of musty pop styles. The follow-up, \"Rubber Bullets,\" topped the charts in 1973, and both the subsequent single \"The Dean and I\" and a self-titled debut LP further solidified 10cc as a major force in British pop.\n\nWhile 1974's \"Sheet Music\" and singles, including the Brian Wilson-esque \"Wall Street Shuffle,\" \"Silly Love\" and \"Life Is a Minestrone\" continued 10cc's dominance of the U.K. charts, they found the American market virtually impenetrable prior to the release of 1975's \"I'm Not in Love,\" which topped the British charts and climbed as high as Number Two in the States. After 1975's \"Original Soundtrack\" and the next year's \"How Dare You!\", Godley and Creme left the band to focus on video production, as well as developing the 'Gizmo', a guitar modification device the duo invented. In the wake of their departure, Gouldman and Stewart continued on alone, enlisting the aid of session men to record 1977's \"Deceptive Bends\", highlighted by the perennial \"The Things We Do for Love.\"\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Rick Fenn, keyboardist Tony O'Malley and drummer Stuart Tosh as full-time members, 10cc returned in 1978 with \"Bloody Tourists\", which yielded the number one reggae nod \"Dreadlock Holiday.\" Following a series of unsuccessful efforts, including 1980's \"Look Hear?\", 1981's \"10 Out of 10\" and 1983's \"Window in the Jungle\", the group disbanded; while Stewart produced Sad Caf\ufffd and worked with Paul McCartney, and Gouldman supervised recordings for The Ramones and Gilbert O'Sullivan before joining Andrew Gold in the duo Wax. In 1992, the original lineup of 10cc reunited for the LP \"Meanwhile\", while only Gouldman and Stewart remained for 1993's \"Mirror Mirror\".",
