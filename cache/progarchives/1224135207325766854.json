  "name": "BILLY COBHAM",
  "genre": "Jazz Rock/Fusion",
  "country": "United States",
  "biography": "William Emanuel Cobham Jr.\n\n- Born May 16, 1944 (Col\ufffdn, Panama)\n\nCOBHAM  moved to New York City when he was just three years old. Flirting with congas and steel drums at the early age of five, Billy started his musical career. He played his first gig with his dad when he was just eight, in New York, 5 years after moving from Panama in 1947.\n\nBeyond already having a superb musical ear and dynamic technique, he refined his musical education in the New York's High School of Music and Art, in which he learnt more drumming techniques and music theory. He graduated in 1962 and began playing in the United States Army Band from 1965 to 1968.\n\nIn 1968 he played with various jazz artists, including jazz pianist HORACE SILVER, sax player STANLEY TURRENTINE, organist SHIRLEY SCOTT and guitarist GEORGE BENSON on the album \"Giblet Gravy\".\n\nHis career as a jazz rock artist started with no other than the most talked-about jazz musician of the time: MILES DAVIS. He recorded five albums with Miles, including \"Bitches Brew\" (in which he was uncredited). It was a giant leap for him, and through Miles Davis he met JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, who would later recruit Billy in the MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA in 1973, one of his most recalled works in the jazz-rock genre. Before the Mahavishnu period he also co-founded the fusion band DREAMS; which featured figures of the calibre of MICHAEL BRECKER and JOHN ABERCROMBIE; also in that band was RANDY BRECKER, DON GROLNICK, BARRY RODGERS and WILL LEE.\n\nIn 1973 he recorded his debut solo album, \"Spectrum\", which featured TOMMY BOLIN on guitar, JAN HAMMER on keyboards, JOE FARRELL on sax and flute, RON CARTER on acoustic bass, LEE SKLAR on electric bass, JIMMY OWENS on trumpet and RAY BARRETTO on congas. This time around he assembled a musical organization consisting of former DREAMS mates MICHAEL BRECKER on sax, RANDY BRECKER on trumpet and newcomers ALEX BLAKE (bass), MILCHO LIEVEV (keyboards), GLEN FERRIS (trombone) and LEE PASTORA (percussion); Cobham performed with the aforementioned band in the Montreax Jazz Festival; a performance which could be heard on the live album \"Shabazz\".\n\nThe trio Brecker, Brecker and Abercrombie remained with Cobham to record \"Crosswinds\" in 1974. Newcomers for the album were bassist JOHN WILLIAMS, trombonist GARNETT BROWN and renowned keyboardist GEORGE DUKE. The album had a similar style to \"Spectrum\", and not as funky as \"Total Eclipse\", which was released the same year with the same line-up as \"Crosswinds\". Billy by then had leaned more toward jazz-funk, in the same vein as HERBIE HANCOCK; a direction much criticized even more since \"A Funky Thide of Sings\".\n\nIn the same year he made another performance at the Montreaux Jazz Festival with the same band as in the \"Shabazz\" album. It was recorded and featured on the live album \"Life & Times\" and also featured performances at the Rainbow Theatre, in London. A year later \"A Funky Thide Of Sings\" and later on \"Inner Conflicts\" were recorded, but while in the former Billy used the same \"Shabazz\" and \"Life & Times\" line-up, in the latter only JOHN WILLIAMS from the \"Crosswinds\" sessions remained, being invited to the set ERNIE WATTS (sax),  JULIAN PRIESTER (trombone), JOHN SCOFIELD (guitar) and SHEILA ESCOVEDO (percussion).\n\nIn 1976 he made a concert tour with keyboardist GEORGE DUKE in the U.S.A and Europe. They also played and recorded in that year's edition of the Montreaux Jazz Festival, which would be released on the \"Cobham/Duke Live\" album.\n\nIn 1977 Cobham switched to CBS Records and made all the albums from 1977 through 1980 under that label: \"A Live Mother For Ya\" (with ALPHONSO THOMPSON, TOM SCOTT and STEVE KAHN), \"Magic\" (featuring PETE and SHEILA ESCOVEDO), \"Montreaux Summit\"  (with DEXTER GORDON, BENNY GOLSON, STAN GETZ, ERIC GALE, MAYNARD FERGUSON, BOBBY HUMPHREYS, GEORGE DUKE and BOB JAMES).\n\nBy 1980 he resigned his contract with CBS and began playing for other artists such as THE GRATEFUL DEAD and JACK BRUCE, as well as the Saturday Night Live Band. In 1981 he recorded \"Flight Time\" under the INAKUSTIC label in Cologne, Germany; called to the session were guitarist BARRY FINNERTY, keyboardist DON GROLNICK and bassist TIM LANDERS. In the same year he participated in the International Percussion Festival in Seattle, along the likes of OKUTA PERCUSSION (Nigeria), ZAKIR HUSSAIN, ALA RAKKA KAHN (India) and the one and only, timbales master TITO PUENTE.\n\nLater on in the early 80's he formed his new quartet \"The Glass Menagerie\" with DEAN BROWN on guitar, MICHAL URBANIAK on violin and sax, TIM LANDERS on bass and GIL GOLDSTEIN on piano. With the quartet he recorded two albums in 1982 under the Elektra label: \"Observations & Reflections\" on January and \"Smokin'\" on July.\n\nIn the mid-80's he made more commercially-oriented albums for GRP: \"Warning\" (1985), \"Power Play\" (1986) and \"Picture This\" (1987).  He then took a break from the studio to focus on international tours and to get acquainted with World Music. In the process he participated in PETER GABRIEL's project called \"Passion\" (Soundtrack for \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", a film by Martin Scorsese) in 1988. He would again work with Peter for the WOMAD festival in 1992.\n\nIn the 90's he formed two bands: one acoustic band called NORDIC in 1996 with Norwegian musicians and one German fusion band called PARADOX in 1997. He also performed with a band called JAZZ IS DEAD, which was more of a jazz tribute to THE GRATEFUL DEAD and released with them an album called \"Blue Light Rain\".\n\nIn 2002 he reunited with RANDY and MICHAEL BRECKER to release \"Drum N Voice\". Its sequel (\"Drum N Voice 2\") featured other well-known figures such as FRANK GAMBALE, JOHN PATITUCCI, AIRTO MOREIRA and JEFF BERLIN. In this album Cobham returned to the jazz-funk sound that characterized his mid-70's material.\n\nThroughout his musical career he has released about 30 albums (counting only his own work) and played with countless number of artists, such as MCCOY TYNER, LARRY CORYELL, HORACE SILVER, GIL EVANS, FREDDIE HUBBARD, STANLEY CLARKE, GEORGE DUKE and RON CARTER, among others pop and jazz artists. He also made projects with educational tools, produced through his company Creative Multi-Media Concepts.\n\nJesus Gabriel Brea (Chus) - March 2007\n\nWhy this artist must be listed in www.progarchives.com :\n\nBILLY COBHAM is a key figure in the development of Jazz-Rock/Fusion, as well as being one of the very best drummers ever.\n\nDiscography:\n\nSolo albums:\n\nSpectrum (1973 - studio album)\n\nCrosswinds (1974 - studio album)\n\nTotal Eclipse\n\nShabazz (1974 - live album)\n\nA Funky Thide of Sings (1975 - studio album)\n\nLife and Times\n\nLive on Tour, Cobham/Duke, at the Montreux jazz Festival\n\nInner Conflicts\n\nSimplicity of Expression (1978 - studio album)\n\nFlight Time (1980 - live album)\n\nStratus (1981 - studio album)\n\nObservations & Reflections\n\nSmokin'\n\nWarning - (1985 - studio album\n\nPower Play (1986 - studio album)\n\nPicture This (1987 - studio album)\n\nThe Best of Billy Cobham (1990 - compilation)\n\nThe Traveler (1994 - studio album)\n\nMississippi Nights: Billy Cobham Live (1998 - live album)\n\nMagic/Symplicity of Expression, Depth of Thought (1998 - studio album)\n\nNordic / Off Color (1999 - studio album)\n\nBy Design (1999 - studio album)\n\nFocused (1999 - studio album)\n\n\"Drum'n'voice\" with Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Eddie Gomez  (2002 - studio album)\n\nCulture Mix\n\nCulture Mix Colours\n\nThe Art of 3\n\nThe Art of 4\n\nThe Art of 5\n\n\"Drum'n'voice 2\" Jan Hammer, Buddy Miles John Patitucci, Dominic Miller, Mike Lindup, Jeff Berlin, Airto Moreira, Frank Gambale, Brian Auger, Guy Barker and Novecento  (2006 - studio album)\n\nAlbums recorded with other artists:\n\n* Horace Silver - You've Got to Take a Little Love\n\n* Kenny Burrell - God Bless the Child\n\n* Dreams - Dreams\n\n* Dreams - Imagine My Surprise\n\n* Miles Davis - A Tribute to Jack Johnson\n\n* Miles Davis - On the Corner\n\n* Miles Davis - Live-Evil\n\n* Miles Davis - Get Up With It\n\n* Miles Davis - Circle in the Round\n\n* Miles Davis - Directions\n\n* Mahavishnu Orchestra - Inner Mounting Flame\n\n* Mahavishnu Orchestra - Birds of Fire\n\n* Mahavishnu Orchestra - Between Nothingness and Eternity\n\n* Mahavishnu Orchestra - Mahavishnu\n\n* Santana/McLaughlin - Love Devotion Surrender\n\n* Peter Gabriel - Passion",
