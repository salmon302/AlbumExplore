  "genre": "Symphonic Prog",
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "biography": "Renaissance biography\n\nFounded in 1969 - Disbanded in 1987 - Reformed between 1998-2002 and again since 2009\n\nThere were two groups under the banner of RENAISSANCE. The first group included Keith and Jane RELF (vocals) and came from the YARDBIRDS ashes. The second and better known incarnation produced some of the best music that I have ever heard. Annie HASLAM's five octave range fit perfectly with the classical/orchestral rock (lot of piano playing & full symphony orchestra backup) created by the other members. The quick description I usually give is they are sort of like the old MOODY BLUES with a an incredible female vocalist. The soprano voice of Annie and the piano virtuosity of John TOUT allied to the beauty and refreshing melodies, the refinement of the arrangements gave their music its magnificent splendour.\n\nPhoto by Brian Tirpak\n\nMy favorite RENAISSANCE albums are \"Ashes Are Burning\" and \"Turn of the Cards\". I also recommend \"Novella\", \"Scheherezade and Other Stories\" and \"A Song for All Seasons\" are must haves. I would add \"Live At Carneige Hall\" and \"King Biscuit Hour Parts 1 and 2\" as their 'prime' material. Plenty to fill a day with class, power and ethereal delights. The best introduction to the band would be the \"Tales of 1001 Nights\" compilation, which together contain of the band's best material from 72 through 80. Also the very first album from '69 is essential. After 1979, the band moved towards a more pop direction, like many other bands did in the late 70's.\n\nSee also:\n\n-\n\nILLUSION\n\n-\n\nJim MCCARTY",
