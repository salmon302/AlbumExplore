It was originally released on Sahara Records, but this is a re-mastered re-issue on the Giant Electric Pea label with three additional bonus tracks. \"The Wake\" are IQ's second album and it was released around the same time as Marillion's \"Misplaced Childhood\". At this time IQ and MARILLION were sound a likes with reminiscences to GABRIEL-era GENESIS. The highlights are the opening track \"Outer Limits\", \"The Wake\", \"Widow's Peak\", the album closer \"Headlong\" and the bonus track \"Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir\". I can't understand why this track wasn't included on the original album instead of \"Corners\". I really like that IQ are using the Mellotron as it wasn't used very often in 80's progressive rock. This is a good album although MARILLION's \"Misplaced Childhood\" were slightly better.

And I spoke of a \"joyful naivete\" in its approach.<p>There is no such naivete here!  From the confident opening synth figure, you know that IQ has matured in a remarkable way.  With the exception of The Thousand Days (the demo of the song is better), every song on this album shows a clear direction, a great deal of creativity, and a far more confident approach to songwriting and arrangement.  And unlike many bands that wear their influences in their sleeves, IQ makes valiant attempts to channel those influences (mostly Genesis and Pink Floyd) into something new and creative - and they succeed far more often than they fail.  In addition, the musicianship is quite good, each member having both a good sense of their own creativity and a good sense of the Genesis member they \"represent.\"  And a listen to Corners, Widow's Peak and Headlong gives a good idea of the direction IQ would ultimately take, toward an even more intense, confident \"classic\" progressive approach (but only after a strange 2-album interlude).<p>Despite the derivative quality of this album (which is not a put-down), I definitely recommend it for any prog-rock collection.  3.5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3618#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3618\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3618\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, February 29, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3618)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=6\"><strong>Peter</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=6\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/F7ED2_Nektar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs with Fish-era Marillion, England's I.Q. is another \"neo-progressive\" band that couldn't have existed without Genesis first pointing the way and brilliantly illuminating the path ahead. As other reviewers have indicated, THE WAKE is the product of a band that clearly owes its inspiration to early Genesis (up to and including A TRICK OF THE TAIL and WIND AND WUTHERING), but -- at least for my taste -- if one group is going to mimic (whether consciously or not) the sound of another, it might as well be that of progressive luminaries Genesis! In any case, I.Q. singer Peter Nicholls (unlike Fish) has a strong voice that sounds nothing like Gabriel's, and the songs themselves are varied and intelligent enough (as the group's somewhat cocky name would seem to suggest) to lift THE WAKE well above the rank of a generic \"rip off\" or clone.<p>Questions of inspiration/originality aside for the nonce, THE WAKE is a fine piece of progressive music, performed by an obviously talented group of musicians. Particularly effective tracks include the atmospheric and even grandiose opener \"Outer Limits;\" the hard-hitting, memorable title track (both songs feature great \"Hackett-esque\" guitar from Mike Holmes); the musically-diverse \"The Magic Roundabout;\" the initially-melancholy, then driving and infectious \"Headlong\" (which has a simply majestic closing section); and \"Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir\" (more superb axe-work here!), one of three \"bonus\" cuts included on the disc. My overall favourite track, though, is the album's longest: \"Widow's Peak\" is by turns magnificent, haunting, and passionate, and as good a piece of progressive music as I've heard since the 70s!<p>Would fans of early progressive rock, who are eager for some new (if not entirely new-sounding) music enjoy this album? Well, your reviewer fits that description, and track for track, I prefer this CD to anything that Genesis have released since \"WIND.\" Though recorded some ten years after the glory days of the genre, THE WAKE is closer to the sound and spirit of early \"prog\" than much of the watered-down, later efforts of once-dependable stalwarts such as Genesis. Thus, I give THE WAKE a four-star rating (I'd give it an additional half star, were that an option), and recommend that you first check out the \"Widow's Peak\" MP3 found here, then order a copy for your progressive rock listening pleasure. Is THE WAKE a future \"five-star\" classic-in-the-making? Quite possibly -- check back with me in a few years! \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3619#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3619\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3619\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, March 14, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3619)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=228\"><strong>lor68</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=228\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/pyramid.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt is a classic issue of the early eighties, containing some famous songs such as \"Widow's Peak\", \"Outer Limits\" and the captivating \"The Magic Roundabout\", true must have songs, often played live along with \"It all stops here\".

Compared to the first one, the tracks here are less epic, \r\nlasting not much more than 9 minutes. All the tracks are at least excellent. The keyboards \r\nare VERY varied, mixing old ones like organ and harpsichord with more modern ones. The \r\nelectric guitar is quite less rebel rock than on the previous album, and Mike Holmes relies on \r\nMANY VERY sustained melodic guitar solos, having substantial echo effects: They sound \r\nlike Steve HACKETT's electric guitar before the 80's. There are some choir-like keyboards \r\n(novatron?) floating in the background. The bass is very good, although it could be louder \r\nand more sophisticated. One of the best bit is on \"Magic Roundabout\", when the clean \r\nrythmic guitar embarks, producing with an OUTSTANDING mellow fretless bass a very \r\npleasant & dreamy atmosphere: GRAND!!!!!!!! \"Widow's Peak\" has great fast and brief \r\ndrums peaks. The last track, \"Headlong\", is very melodramatic and very progressive, \r\nnevertheless having a happy ending: it sounds like albums as old as \"Nursery Cryme\" \r\nand \"Foxtrot\", especially the beginning. The weak point is the poor ambience due to \r\na \"monochromatic\" sound: I  must remove half a star for that because it is very flagrant \r\nand irritating. Unfortunately, it does not sound as atmospheric as \r\nthe \"Subterranea\", \"Ever\" and \"Seventh House\" albums. However, I strongly recommend \r\nthe corresponding live album, \"Living Proof\", which has a quite better ambience & \r\natmosphere. <p>My rating: 4.5/5</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3632#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3632\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3632\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, April 11, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3632)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=114\"><strong>richardh</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=114\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/114/af5d2032-17c8-4974-b74e-8526b424a141.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWell this is one of 2 IQ albums that deserve the 5 star rating.A dark almost overwhelming record that grabs you by the throat and just won't let go.'The Magic Roundabout' has absolutely nothing to do with Dougal and chums I can assure you ,while 'Widows Peak' has one of the most startling intros to any peice of music I've heard.Paul Cook is awesome on the skins here.The star of the show undoubtedly though is Pete Nicholls who lends an intensity to the songs that is very rare in music.This is a special record.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3624#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3624\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3624\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, April 29, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3624)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI knew this band from this album right after I was amazed by the appearance of \r\nMarillion's Script for A Jester's Tear. Judging from the cover itself, you would definitely \r\nguess that this is a Gabrielish (early Genesis) sort of music. Look at the mask. Yeah .. \r\nyou bet! This is another progressive band in the vein of early Genesis (Hackett's era, \r\nnot so specific Gabriel era), even though it's rather tiny at  vocal part. Overall, this \r\nalbum is excellent! If you enjoy Genesis' \"Fly on a Windshield\", \"The Lamia\", \"One for \r\nThe Vine\", \"All of Mosuses's Night\" or \"Blood on a Rooftops\" .. yesszzz!!! This is your \r\nchoice of album. You would not regret with this album. But .. please take note on some \r\npoints: don't try to compare with Genesis (Hackett's era), this was a new band by that \r\ntime. You may notice how the drumming was performed poorly in the opening \r\ntrack \"Outer Limits\". It sounds poppy in my opinion. It has no varieties like what Phil \r\nCollins did with Genesis. Oopps .. I should not compare it. Sorry ...\r\nHowever, I would rate this band as having BIG FIVE STAR in creating a truly melodic \r\nand harmonious music, regardless their musicianship. Afterall, their later albums \r\ndemonstrated significant improvements in their musicianship. You may \r\ntry \"Ever\", \"Subterranea\", \"The Seventh House\".\r\nThe first thing that strike me and make me hooked to this band is their title track \"The \r\nWake\". Ghusszzzz ...!! This track is so wonderful; energetic. The other excellent tracks \r\nare \"Widow' Peak\" and \"Headlong\". Oh God ... these are another melodic music I've \r\never heard. If you like Genesis \"One for The Vine\", definitely you will like these.\r\nThis album is a MUST HAVE for prog afficionado. Definitely ....! - Gatot Widayanto, \r\nIndonesia.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3626#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3626\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3626\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, May 27, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3626)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=428\"><strong>James Lee</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n[ begin the Rod Serling voiceover]\r\nPicture if you will, GENESIS- but in an alternate universe in which they resisted Phil's \r\ncoup but accepted the 80s production trends. While it is definitely laudable for carrying \r\na prog torch at the same time GENESIS as well as YES, ELP and PINK FLOYD were \r\nshamelessly embracing commercialism, it fails to find new meanings like KING CRIMSON \r\nor RUSH (although IQ's better pop moments do forecast the candian trio's 90s sound). \r\nThere are some embarassingly dated-sounding moments; the gated drums on \"Outer \r\nLimits\" are very like solo-Collins, but the song itself reminds me somewhat of STYX- take \r\nthat as you will. The title track brings ALDO NOVA to mind but has some interesting bits \r\nin between the verses. \"The Magic Roundabout\" is less whimsical than the name would \r\nsuggest; the lyrics are self-pitying and poorly written, and strangely enough the demo \r\nhas a tighter rhythm section than the final version. Anybody remember TOM \r\nPETTY's \"Don't Come Around Here No More\"? \"Corners\" is a sonic sibling, with a more \r\noverwrought vocal and no mad hatter video.  \"Widows Peak\" proves indisputably the \r\nties to 70s GENESIS, but is also one of the better tracks, as is \"Dans Le Parc Du \r\nChateau Noir\". \"Headlong\" has a weak start- the lyrics are again of poor quality-  but \r\nrevs up to a nice soaring chorus. \"Thousand Days\" is a good 80s pop song (the demo \r\nversion isn't too far from \"Murmur\"-era REM) with touches of \"Run Like Hell\" in the \r\nguitar, but my throat hurts when I hear him straining for the high notes. Overall the \r\nband is a bit bland. Hackett was a more admirable guitar foil to the wall of synth (on \r\nearlier albums, at least) and the guitars here are both more aggressive and less \r\noriginal. The drums often sound like 80s Phil Collins but only occasionally aprroach his \r\nmusicianship (and sometimes sound downright sloppy!). Gabriel balanced his dramatic \r\nqualities with a dry humor and a touch of anglo-soul, whereas Peter Nicholls focuses on \r\nprecisely enunciated theatricality to add life to an unimpressive vocal timbre (think \r\nWaters' unsteady tenor mixed with an amateur, embryonic James LaBrie). On the other \r\nhand, the keyboards add lush and intersting textures when they're not relegated to \r\nmerely chord pads. All-in-all \"The Wake\" is a mixed bag; kudos for keeping the dream \r\nalive in 1985, but in this case it is one of those dreams you have a hard time recalling \r\nonce it's over. My three stars are stretched pretty thin here; I'd have kept it to two but \r\nthis album is more historically important than the quality of the music ultimately \r\ndeserves.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3627#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3627\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3627\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, June 17, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3627)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHad this site existed twenty years ago , I might have given this album maximum ratings but \r\nthree or four years after I would have downgraded it of one star and now I can only give \r\na three star. Why such severity, You ask? Well if at the early 80's , this was seen as a \r\nmajor album for the survival of prog (although , we never saw it that way back then for we \r\ndid not know what lay ahead) it was the only prog available with Marillion's debut. So there \r\nwas a serious drought for the thirsty proghead that I was , and was probably blinded by \r\nthe fact that the album existed at all and did not realize the glaring weaknesses - especially \r\nin the inspiration/inventivity  dept but also in the voice.

There are strong shades of Yes in the music, \"Drama\" in particular came to mind a few times. Likewise, the sound of Steve Hackett's guitar echoed across several of the tracks. <p>That's not to say the music bears any direct connection with the music of Yes or Genesis, there certainly no suggestion of borrowed themes etc. It's very much the overall feel of the album I'm comparing, and purely for reference purposes. Other reference points to a greater or lesser extent would be Marillion, Pallas and Arena.<p>\"The Wake\" is a fine neo-prog album, with plenty of symphonic keyboards, melodic lead guitar, changing themes lengthy tracks, the lot. The Achilles heel to some extent is the vocals which are adequate but no more. <p>The feature track, \"Widow's peak\", is a nine minute epic with all the aforesaid ingredients, plus a strong performance. Many of the tracks merge together (a la Moody Blues), giving the album a continuity and apparently more complex structure. The version I have includes a \"bonus track\", Dans Le Parc\". I can't say the track, an instrumental, adds anything to the album, but it does display once again the virtuosity of the band.<p>An enjoyable album of straightforward neo-prog. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3630#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3630\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3630\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, November 25, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3630)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=2666\"><strong>Prog-jester</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=2666\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/2666/fdf.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAlmost a masterpiece! Comparing with debut it's more carefully produced, with better recording \r\nwork etc. The opening \"Outer Limits\" is very energetic, with enormous drive, also it is pretty structured as for 80s Neo ;). \"The Wake\" - the song - is a real hard-prog-rock hit, transforming into \"The Magic Roundabout\" with its unusual structure and thrilling climax (the closing solo is great, too). \"Corners\" seem to drag forever, but works on the song, really. \"Widow's Peak\", another epic story, is the longest track here. Another could-be-single \"The Thousand Days\" works better in demo version (at least, for me), while here it's ruined by a minute of synths' trickery. I adore \"Headlong\" ballad with its opening lamenting vocals - very \r\nhaunting, very marillionic! - and that powerful coda...amazing, to say the least! \"Dans...\" also has some highlights, especially in solos (I wonder \r\nwhy this track wasn't featured on the album). A very mature work, highly recomended \r\nespecially for those who doesn't believe in well-crafted 80's Neo-Prog ;)   </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3634#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3634\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3634\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, April 24, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3634)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3684\"><strong>erik neuteboom</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBefore writing this review, I took a brief look at the other reviews on this site, mainly in \r\norder to watch their ratings. Well, the lowest rating is good (3 stars) and almost half of the \r\nreviewers regard this album as a masterpiece (5 stars). I've decided to give it four stars: \r\nthis album includes some of the best compositions IQ ever wrote but \"The thousand days\" \r\nis too mainstream prog and \"Corners\" even rubbish! And I would like to emphasize that \r\nloving IQ seems to be very subjective: I remember all those fanatic discussions between \r\nMarillion freaks, Genesis die-hards and IQ fans on our weekly progrock sessions, some \r\neven hated IQ and many Genesis - and Marillion fans still do! I think Dr. Phil and even \r\nJerry Springer would have paid a fortune to these progheads for having them in their \r\nshows, what a highly dramatic and tremendous hilarious scenes! But seriously folks, this is \r\nan album to be carried away to a progwalhalla: what a wonderful and compelling \r\ncompositions, loaded with captivating breaks, spectacular changing climates (\"Widow's \r\npeak\" featuring halfway propulsive electric guitar, bombastic Mellotron and dramatic \r\nvocals), splendid interplay between keyboards and guitar (this is IQ their trademark) and \r\ngreat soli. I can imagine that the vocals and the rhythm-section could cause some \r\ndiscussion but to me they sound OK and in general I like Pete's slightly dramatic voice. Of \r\ncourse \"Corners\" is a crappy maverick but things has been put right by adding the killer \r\nbonustrack \"Dans le chateau du parc noir\", what a breathtaking build-up and moving guitar \r\nsolo, GOOSE BUMPS!! For the young progrock aficionados this album could sound a bit \r\ndated but it's so dynamic and I love the vintage keyboard sound by Martin Offord, from \r\nthe hugh triple manual Yamaha CS80 synthesizer to the polyphonic Memorymoog and \r\nESPECIALLY THE OMNIPRESENT M400 CHOIR-MELLOTRON SOUNDS SO IMPRESSIVE!!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=38495#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=38495\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=38495\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 4, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #38495)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1820\"><strong>NJprogfan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWith the bass thumping that starts out the album, then the wash of keyboards, and finally \r\nthe song proper begins, it pulls you in with Nicholl's pleading voice and lyrics. This was the \r\nfirst album I bought by the band and immediately enjoyed Nicholl's distinctive voice. Even \r\nmoreso, I put his lyrical prowess up there with Peter Gabriel and Dave Cousins, my two \r\nother favorite writers. Every song on the album has that IQ stamp, fantastic keyboards by \r\nMartin Orford, Mike Holme's Hackett inspired guitar work and Peter Cooks excellent \r\ndrumming, mix them with a gothic sheen and Nichol's somber lyrics and you get a wonderful \r\nmix. Other than the syrupy 80's Genesis sounding \"Corners\" and the somewhat decent \r\npoppy song \"The Thousand Days\", there are huge classics on this disc. \"Headlong\" , \"The \r\nMagic Roundabout\" and the bonus track, \"Dans Le Pare Du Chateau Noir\"are flat out \r\nmasterpieces of gothic, Genesis inspired prog. Just imagine \"Wind and Wuthering\" era \r\nGenesis mixed with a ting of The Cure/Bauhaus/Echo and the Bunnymen...new romantic \r\nprog. Don't forget, it came out 1985 and had to deal with the big English bands of the day. \r\nI give them props for trying something different. I agree with other reviewers when they \r\nsay that this album is a great starting point to dip into the neo-prog pool.

With this album, the group decided to focus on more \r\nconcise pieces rather than sprawling epics, and to simply put it they hit the mark once \r\nagain. Although the sound of this album is very 80s, there are a lot of progressive \r\nmoments and times when you feel like you could listen to this stuff forever. Think of this \r\nmusic as technical instrumental passages coupled with melodic and well composed vocal \r\nsections (as with every IQ album). The group plays wonderfully on this album and the \r\nintricate riffs and patterns they play sound wonderful and are very creative. Mike \r\nHolmes, although not the looker at this period of his life mainly because of his hair, is \r\nthe star of this album giving 100% and really showing that he is a very competent \r\nguitarist.<p>The album opens with the droning syncopated rhythm of Outer Limits. The bass and \r\ndrums really connect well for the introduction of this song. The keyboard tone here is \r\nlush and vibrant and the chord progression is really unique. A nice 5/4 rhythm comes in \r\nright before the vocals, in which Paul Cook really shows his skills on the kit, giving some \r\nreally nice fills. This steady 5/4 beat remains for the rest of the song, but alternates \r\nwith a 7/8 and 7/4 pattern. The outro is the same droning beat that began the song. \r\nThe Wake begins with a bang. Strong drumming from Cook and some quality leads from \r\nHolmes breaks into a powerful riff with some nice organ and distorted guitar. Holmes \r\nshines with a terrific solo in the middle of it and Orford is great with his synthesizer fills \r\nand his pseudo mellotron choirs.<p>The Magic Roundabout has a nice ascending and descending riff in the beginning, and \r\nNichols' vocal on this track is really strong. The droning riff from Outer Limits is reprised \r\nhere, albeit in a bit different form and a bit more subtle than the song itself. Holmes \r\ngives another great guitar solo at the end to put the icing on the cake that is The Magic \r\nRoundabout. Corners begins with some electronic percussion, and some precision \r\nplaying at that. Orford then gives airy fills with his synthesizer while Nichols gives a \r\npassionate vocal performance. Tim Esau gives a dynamic bass performance on this one, \r\noffering a complex and catchy bass line that keeps the song at a groove. Some sitar \r\ncomes in around the 4th minute during a very long fadeout, showing the \r\nexperimentation of the group. It's not a terribly strong song, though; as it could have \r\nbeen cut down tremendously and there is a lack of real feel to the song.<p>Widow's Peak begins with some chorused riffing from Holmes in the vein of Steve \r\nRothery or Alex Lifeson. Some anxious flute, courtesy of Orford, comes in with a nice \r\n7/8 motif. Nichols vocal flows well with the soaring synths of Orford and the dynamic \r\ndrumming of Paul Cook. Holmes gets another little section to show his riffing skills near \r\nthe 6th minute, and he really gets the Rothery vibe on Perimeter Walk (part of the \r\nMarillion song Blind Curve). The ending of the song features some strong work from \r\nOrford and Esau. The Thousand Days begins with some nice riffing from Holmes and a \r\ngreat bass line from Esau. The textured work from Orford and the consistent work from \r\nCook make this song a really enjoyable one to listen to. Headlong begins somberly with \r\nsome emotional vocals from Nichols and some anxious keyboard work from Orford. A \r\nnice guitar riff comes in, and it soon has this great feeling of mystery as Orford gives a \r\ndynamic keyboard solo that takes many twists and turns. Mike Holmes gets some time \r\nto shine as well, giving a very well played solo involving many slides up and down the \r\nfret board the album. In the end, this is a terrific (and epic) closer to the end of the \r\nalbum.<p>Overall, this is a terrific album that really is one of IQ's finest moments. My only gripes \r\nwith the album is the sub par production (while not terrible, it could have been better) \r\nand Corners is a song that could have used a lot of work to perfect. In the end, \r\nthough, you can't go wrong with this album, a terrific starter for someone just getting \r\ninto IQ. 4.5/5.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81678#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81678\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=81678\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, June 22, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #81678)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n4.5 stars. A record about death but it's not as dark and moody as one would think. This is without a doubt one of IQ's best albums. It's also the first IQ record I ever listened to. <p>It's pretty cool \r\nthat the theme in the first song \"Outer Limits\" can be heard in the final song \"Headlong\". Four of the seven songs have mellotron provided by \r\nMr.Orford, who also supplies us with moog, synths, flute and keyboards.\r\n\"Outer Limits\" begins with \r\nan ominous bass line coupled with synths until we hear the amazing vocals of Peter \r\nNicholls. A steady beat with lots of mellotron follows. I really like the synths 3 1/2 minutes in. Nice guitar after 6 1/2 minute too. \"The Wake\" has some terrific drums and keyboards, along with mellotron and some \r\nsplendid guitar.The intro is so powerful. Check out the guitar after 2 minutes.This song blends into \"The Magic Roundabout\" which opens with a powerful atmosphere and lots of synths. It kicks in before 2 minutes. It settles 3 minutes in, it's such a beautiful section as Peter comes in vocally. I also like when we get a calm 6 1/2 minutes in and the gorgeous guitar that follows. \"Corners\" opens with percussion and drums as synths then reserved vocals come into this laid back tune. <p>\"Widow's Peak\" has lots of time changes, and I just love the sound \r\nof this song. It opens with some atmosphere before kicking in around 1 1/2 minutes with mellotron. When the vocals come in i'm smiling. God bless Peter Nicholls ! I really like when it settles 2 1/2 minutes in. Great section ! It kicks back in with guitar leading the way. Paul's beating the hell out of his drumkit here. Another calm 4 1/2 minutes in before kicking back in around 6 minutes with vocals. Beautiful guitar solo 8 minutes in. What a song !  \"Thousand Days\" might be my favourite. It's so moving for me, just an uplifting and emotional track really. It has a spacey ending. \"Headlong\" features fragile vocals and mellotron comes in before a minute. It starts to build after 2 minutes. Incredible ! It settles again 3 1/2 minutes in then a minute later we get that familiar and uplifting melody. I have to mention the bonus track called \"Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir\". This song is simply an amazing addition to this album. Mellow to start before kicking in after a minute. A powerful soundscape before 3 minutes. No melody just waves of synths. A guitar melody comes out of it and leads the way.<p>\r\nThis is one of my favourite IQ records and I highly recommend it.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94872#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94872\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=94872\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 17, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #94872)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=378\"><strong>Cesar Inca</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nTo me, this album and Twelfth Night's \"Fact and Fiction\" are the ultimate masterpiece in the \r\n80s era of the British neo-prog wave. Both albums comprise the frontal energetic vibe of \r\nthe time's rock scene and the high standards (musically and dramatically) of vintage \r\nsymphonic prog, with special regards to the influences of Gabriel-era Genesis, Camel, and \r\nas a plus, UK. The latter point of reference can be clearly noticed in Ordford' keyboard \r\ninput for most of the darkest passages in the album. Although... this album as a whole \r\nkeeps a consistent dark mood, which is logical considering the integral concept: a man \r\npasses away, takes a bitter look at what used to be his earthly life, indulges himself in \r\ndoubt, regret and fear before taking the definitive step into the world of the dead. So, the \r\ndrama is not in the moment of death or the arrival at Heaven, but in the sense of \r\nconfusion that drowns the dead man's soul in the meantime. Well, the instrumentation and \r\nthe musical ideas fit Nicholls' lyrical adventures and ever growing singing energy quite well. \r\nTo be more specific - the guitar passages and the rhythm section bear a harder edge than \r\non the IQ's debut album, while the keyboard department finds the mellotron, string \r\nensemble and organ sounds assuming a sort of leading role, in this way, creating horror \r\nmovie ambiences in lots of places. The intro section of 'Outer Limits' kicks off the album in \r\nthe vein of UK's anthem 'In the Dead of Night', until things get settled in a Genesis-meets-\r\npunk atmosphere, very early IQ, indeed. After the final sequences of bass, drum and \r\nagonizing breaths, the powerful namesake track gets in and sets a very ballsy mood: the \r\nband flirts with heavy metal on this one. Nicholls' singing almost effortlessly equals the \r\nguitar aggression: one of his most amazing performances during the early 80s. 'The Magic \r\nRoundabout' returns to the epic essence of the opening song, while bearing a more \r\nmelancholic spirit: the keyboard orchestrations and the fretless bass guitar are almost \r\nsurreal. Not as epic but prolonging with the dreamy mood, 'Corners' shifts things to bring a \r\nPeter Gabriel kind of thing with its electronic-ethnic structure, based on a mixture of white \r\nreggae, slight Arabic textures and languid techno-pop. I love this song for what it is - a \r\nnice, refreshing interlude between two epics. The following long track is one of my fave IQ \r\nsongs ever: from the eerie prologue to the brief guitar flourishes at the end, everything in \r\nbetween makes 'Widow's Peak' a definite epitome of the band's most bombastic side, \r\nequalling the emotional engagement of track 3 and surpassing the clever complexity of \r\ntrack 1. 'The Thousand Days', on the other hand, has a more straightforward appeal: \r\nperhaps the best song The Cure has never done? The floating synth layers that fill the \r\naforesaid song's aftermath serves as an adequate prelude to the final track 'Headlong'. \r\nAlthough bearing a gloomy mood similar to the other epics, the closing section sets a \r\nplayful Celtic-based motif, in this way protraying the optimistic redemption of the soul that \r\ncomes to terms with its ultimate fate.

The rhythm section is bland while the guitar is shrill and equally \r\nunexciting... and the vocal's must be a <em>very</em> acquired taste.  That being said, the songwriting is occasionally interesting, but the performances do little to get one excited about them.<p>\r\nI suppose IQ's contribution to the short-lived prog revival of the '80's is worthy of respect, \r\nbut those looking for an example of this era's sound would do better seeking elsewhere.  \r\nListen before you buy!<p>Songwriting: 2\r\nInstrumental Performances: 1\r\nLyrics/Vocals: 1\r\nStyle/Emotion/Replay: 1</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=117240#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=117240\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=117240\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, April 3, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #117240)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's debut album was very promising and I was really enthusistic this album. The IQ \r\nsound was all there since their first work, so this one is a very nice follow-up.<p>In just less than two year's time, IQ will come back with a very sophisticated album. Of \r\ncourse, the recipe will be almost the same; but since it was very tasteful, there are no \r\nfundemental problem with this aspect of their work.<p>Most numbers flow nicely the one into each other and \"Outer Limits\" sets the pace. \r\nImposing keys, tortured vocals (the filiation with Gabriel won't disappear of course). I \r\nmentioned already that IMO Peter Nicholls sounds even more as Gabriel than Fish for \r\ninstance. His solemn tone being less \"spectacular\" than Fish's one, but as powerful. \r\nJust another form of acting I would say. <p>The title track although short, is expressive and particularly well balanced. Imposing \r\nkeys (as usual, should I say). This is really a neo-prog anthem. Heavy bass and solid \r\ndrums. The necessary instrumental guitar touch and a very catchy melody. To \r\nsummarize : a good song. <p>Of course with \"The Magic Roundabout\", we seem to be transported into \"Watcher\". It \r\nis amazing to notice how many times this fabulous Genesis number has been partially \r\nused. It is evident for about two minutes: full of mellotron and then the supreme eight \r\nnotes riff. Incomparable (I'm talking about the original one). Fortunately, this song will \r\nbring some more feelings than just past history. Orford is again brilliant on the keys.<p>The reggae-ish \"Corners\" might sound funny, but it bores me to death. Press skip. The \r\npoorest IQ number so far.<p>Fortunately, as if IQ needs to be forgiven they will provide us with the best number of \r\nthis album. \"Widow's Peak\" is definitively the peak here. Mike produces great guitar \r\nwork and the whole band is absolutely bombastic. This is a wonderful IQ track. One of \r\nthose for which I have the most profund respect. A gorgeous and spacey instrumental \r\npart precedes a section introduced by a similar riff as in \"Run Like Hell\" (another often \r\nused theme amongst neo-prog bands). Peter sounds very emotional and adds this little \r\nextra which makes the difference between a good and a great track. Wonderful closing.<p>In comparison \"The Thousand Days\" is a simple yet attractive number. Not complex at \r\nall. Just a simple, but good song. I guess that from time to time, bands can produce this \r\ntype of songs without being regarded as being too simplistic. <p>The closing number \"Headlong\" sounds sad. A very weird atmosphere prevails. We'll get \r\nthe famous riff here and there (you know \"Watcher\"...). It is full of harmony. A great \r\nclosing number. Such numbers can only fill your heart with the utmost pleasure. This is \r\nwhat prog is about : generate emotions. And IQ knows how to do it, believe me.<p>The remastered CD version features three bonus tracks. I am totally in love with the \r\nFrench titled \"Dans le Parc du Chateau Noir\". It is simply my preferred song of the \r\nwhole. The guitar is incredible, so passionate (thanks again Mike). We'll even get some \r\nreminiscence of \"Watcher\". Would you believe ? Brilliant. How this number was not \r\nconsidered for the album inclusion will remind a mystery. Thanks for having remembered \r\nthat it ever existed, friends. The other bonus tracks are alternate (and shorter) \r\nversions of numbers featured on the album. I have never been found of \"edits\". So, my \r\njudgment will not change with this one.<p>If I hadn't stop listening to prog music for so long (1978 - 1996), I guess I would have \r\nbeen REALLY in love with such an album at the time of its release. Since I have \r\ndiscovered all these works since then, there is no harm, only a dealy. I am very happy \r\nto share my enthusiasm about this album and more generally about this band. <p>Great music. Great rating. Four stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=120052#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=120052\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=120052\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 28, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #120052)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12334\"><strong>b_olariu</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12334\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12334/4927969.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ - what an intelligent name for a prog band. The wake along with Misplaced childhood are \r\namong the best albums of neo-prog  if not the best. IQ truly carried the torch of \r\nprogressive music into the 80s. The second album, \"The Wake\" are among the very finest \r\nprogressive rock albums released in that decade.  ESSENTIAL PROG!!! to all prog listners. \r\nForte tracks i find Magic roundabout, Window's peak and Outer limits. The musicians are  \r\namong the finest in prog, specialy Peter Nicholls (very gifted singer, unmatch tone of \r\nvoice), and the true master of this album Martin Orford, who really knows how to use the \r\ninstrument and to create something valueble for then, now and for tommorow. 4 stars and \r\nessential album.

In the middle of these 80's they produced this album and though \r\nthat was important I kept listening simply to the musical effort on itselve and judged the album critically. I wasn't very impressed.\r\nI compared it to Marillion which was better then to my opinion. I thought this was all a bit slow and not exactly compelling. Prog has \r\nto be compelling for me that's why I love it.\r\nIf I would judge it now it would be even more critical, there is simply more material for comparison and the standard is getting higher \r\nand higher.\r\nI'm sorry I can't let sentimental reasons (the siginificance for progmusic in a difficult period)  have the upper hand in me to come to \r\nthe judgement for this album.

I have to say,\r\nif I had been  smart enough to be listening to this album when it came out, I probably would not have predicted much\r\nlong-term success for the band.  This is definitely an album created by young, talented musicians who seem to be on the same\r\npage from a composition standpoint.  However, they still needed to mature as a group, which they certainly would do in later\r\nalbums.<p>The extended pieces are for the most part well done, especially given the time period.  I think even at this point, IQ had\r\ntheir own identity and were not simply copying Genesis as best they could, even though some similarities are much too obvious\r\nto even attempt to deny (such as Holmes' Hackett-like guitar and Nicholls' Gabe-esque wails).  Outer Limits is an especially\r\nrefreshing opener, with an ominous bass/synth intro leading to the bright, uptempo vocal section.  Orford also quickly\r\nestablishes himself with tasteful synth arrangements and riveting flourishes.  The Magic Roundabout and Widow's Peak are also\r\nexcellent pieces, mixing up tempos and moods throughout and leading to full, guitar driven finishes.  The one exception to\r\nthe rule is the closer, Headlong.  The conclusion is catchy and well done, but there's too much build up featuring Nicholls\r\non vocals--his voice is just not of an acceptable quality to be that exposed for that long.<p>The shorter songs are also generally high quality.  The title track is relatively simply and heavy, but offers some great\r\nguitar and is catchy if nothing else.  The Thousand Days has a basic chord progression that matches at least three other\r\npopular songs I can name off the top of my head, but is at least uptempo and easy on the ears as well.  The only true dog on\r\nthe album is Corners: simple, plodding, and wholly uninteresting.<p>Beware that Nicholls' voice is\r\nquite rough--generally it is not a good idea for vocalists who have nasally and shrill voices to forget about paying\r\nattention to their pitch, and he is no exception.  Fortunately, most of the songs are written well enough and feature enough\r\ngoing on underneath the vocals that the often poor singing does not distract terribly from the listening experience.  All in\r\nall, The Wake is one of few quality and cohesive albums from the time period, and as such should be given proper respect.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155963#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155963\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=155963\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, December 19, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #155963)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=272\"><strong>The Prognaut</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=272\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/272/SW_TRTRTS.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nNot bad for being born in the reckless mid-eighties. Even though it's not one of the best productions by \r\nIQ over the years to me, I have to admit it's one out of their entire discography that gives the band \r\nrecognition. Up to \"The Wake\" the sound was still quite appealing to MARILLION's and very poor in \r\nelaboration in spite of the marvelous execution of good old Martin ORFORD on keyboards. I think of this \r\nrecord as a determinant transition for IQ to jump right on a very unique seal that landed steady on the \r\nyears to come in order to consider this English band as promising.<p>The musical resources applied in here are very reliable and enjoyable most of all. It was the time \r\nwhere Peter NICHOLLS still covered up his face in make-up a la GENESIS and where the performance \r\novershadowed the presence on stage. Still, great songs were arranged and released in \"The Wake\", \r\njust like the self-named song and \"Widow's Peak\", that happen to be some of the Neo-Prog tracks I \r\nenjoy listening to the most.<p>Other long pieces were included as well but weren't that convincing to me out of first listen like they're \r\nnow. Take \"The Magic Roundabout\" for instance, the track was intended to be impressive and \r\nelaborated somehow, but I feel no remorse by saying it's anything out of this world. If not lousy, it isn't \r\na jewel either. On the other hand, \"Corners\" is so extremely experimental that it provokes no surprise \r\nat all and thus, it brings nothing to the table by being plain and merely poor.<p>Regarding one of the most important elements on any fine production, I'm talking about the lyrics \r\nhere; \"The Wake\" is a bit disappointing on that issue yet very less proposing and quite corny to tell the \r\nstory of a dead man in sequels. Such finger pointing nark goes especially to \"The Thousand Days\" \r\nand \"Headlong\". There are still some pop-rock elements that outshine the progressive effort \r\nwhatsoever.<p>I'm reviewing The Wake based upon the 2006 re-issue released by INSIDE-OUT label which includes \r\nan outstanding bonus track. \"Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir\" is a brilliant turning point that under my \r\nown perspective, it should've been added on the first edition. It's just like this piece belonged to a \r\nwhole different album. The elements are linked superbly, this is fair ground alright.<p>So as usual, I'll give you a piece of my mind of the album. Good, but not essential. A remarkable effort \r\nbut far from being amazing. It's quite a keeper though, but don't let your hopes get that high when \r\nlending ears to it. Deservedly, three out of five ranking stars.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=175865#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=175865\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=175865\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, July 2, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #175865)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe Wake is the second studio album from progressive rock act IQ. It\u00b4s an album \r\nI\u00b4ve owned for about six or seven years but haven\u00b4t listened to much before \r\nrecently. It\u00b4s a bit of a shame though and I\u00b4ll definitely give it more spins \r\nin the future.<p>The music is very Genesis and Marillion influenced which means that melodic and \r\nbeautiful keyboard and guitar soundscapes and generally melancholic vocals \r\nfills my ears when I listen to the songs on this album. The mood is actually \r\npretty dark and intense at times and it suits my taste really well. Songs like \r\nOuter Limits, The Wake, The Magic Roundabout, Widow\u00b4s Peak, Headlong and the CD \r\nbonus track Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir are really great dark and symphonic \r\nprogressive tracks. The Thousand Days is an uptempo song. Still melancholic but \r\na bit lighter in mood than the rest of the songs I\u00b4ve mentioned. The only song \r\nI don\u00b4t like much is the silly Corners. It\u00b4s not a very good song with a \r\nstrange instrument choice. Tablas and Citar ? IQ goes psychadelic rock ? I\u00b4m \r\nnot impressed. The two other CD bonus songs are The Thousand Days and The Magic \r\nRoundabout in demo versions. I don\u00b4t like the idea of putting out demos as \r\nbonus tracks so that\u00b4s not a plus in my book. I\u00b4ll take it for what it is \r\nthough and not judge the album any harder because of this.<p>The musicianship is excellent and we\u00b4re treated with lots of beautiful and \r\nvaried keyboard playing from Martin Orford and the same can be said about the \r\nguitar playing from Mike Holmes. The rythm section isn\u00b4t the most exciting part \r\nof the music on The Wake but they are solid. Peter Nicholls is a great singer. \r\nI really enjoy his melancholic style. Great emotion.<p>The production is a bit raw but still enjoyable. With a more warm sound on the \r\ndrums it could have been better IMO.<p>The Wake is a great second album from IQ and fully deserving a 4 star rating \r\nfrom me. There are some obvious flaws on the album as I described above but \r\noverall it\u00b4s an excellent album that fans of emotional and dark symphonic \r\nprogressive rock should find pleasure in.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=190519#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=190519\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=190519\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, November 26, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #190519)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>A-wake and nervous</strong><p>While an improvement over the sprawling debut album, Tales From The Lush Attic, and also more interesting than the next album, Nomzamo, The Wake is not quite the classic it is often claimed to be. Widow's Peak and the title track are indeed great songs that are eternal IQ classics with a permanent place in the band's live set until the present day. The rest of the songs do not have the same impact and the album tends to drag in some parts. It is indeed listenable, but only the title track and Widow's Peak really stand out for me. The rest is not particularly memorable, though Corners has a very nice sitar-driven ending. Is this Raga Rock?<p>Another problem is the subpar production which is not noticeably improved over the debut. The sound quality is not downright horrible by any means, but The Wake pales in comparison with other Neo-Prog classics from the same period such as the albums by Marillion. The weak production also makes this album sound a bit dated. Sonic quality is not everything, of course. If it has great tunes a bad sound and production may be forgiven, but as implied this album has only very few great tunes.<p>Lead vocalist Peter Nicholls would leave the band following this album but he returned for the recording of Ever in the early 90's. In my opinion, IQ wouldn't really find their own musical direction until his return, but the seed of what was to be indeed lies here. The feeling and mood of this album is darker than that of Ever and very much darker than the almost cheerful (in parts) Are You Sitting Comfortably? thus foreshadowing to some extent the dark and excellent Dark Matter from many years later. As far as I'm concerned though, the peak of the band's career ( which I would say came with Dark Matter) was still many years away at this stage.  <p>The Wake undoubtedly constitutes an important part of the band's history as well as the history of the Neo-Prog genre and this is what makes it a worthwhile addition in the end, even if it fails to impress me much. The album's best moments are featured in better versions on various live albums together with other IQ classics similarly updated so this is not essential.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=224320#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=224320\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=224320\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 3, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #224320)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25551\"><strong>snobb</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25551\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25551/psychiatrist.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis album of neo-prog IQ music is good. I think, it will be more correct still to name this \r\nmusic \"symphonic rock\" ( the same with earlier Marillion albums). You can feel strong \r\ninfluence of Yes and Genesis there, but as a result the music is quite original. Pretty \r\nmelodies, multi textured sound, complex instrumentation. Vocal as usual is IQ strong part.<p>I think that some earlier Marillion or IQ albums in fact are just the same sympho-prog \r\nmusically. Neo-prog means more time parameter for them ( ok, it happens in eighties,not \r\nseventies). But for me these works have more in common with earlier progressive music. Few \r\nyears later plenty of bands started to play plain faceless clone of that music under the name of \r\nneo-prog. Even Marillion or IQ later albums are different - the same faceless secondary sound.<p>So, this album is one of real strong early neo-prog example, and one of rare pleasantly \r\nlistanable album of all neo-prog collection.<p>Recommended  ( near few first Marillion albums) for anyone, who is interested in early neo-\r\nprog as one of the best examples.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=240811#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=240811\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=240811\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, September 22, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #240811)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17216\"><strong>Sinusoid</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAn ironic title if there ever was one because ''Wake'' is exactly what I'm not feeling when \r\nlistening to this album.<p>THE WAKE represents my first try with both IQ and neo-prog in general.  The word that \r\nbeautifully describes my response is ''underwhelmed'', as in I expected this album to be \r\none of the greatest I've ever heard and it disappointed on so many levels.<p>One of the problems that I've just seemed to notice is the production.  In general, it sounds \r\ntoo muffled; I can't really hear much of the bass guitar.  It's too one-sided in favour of the \r\nkeyboards in the aspect that the keyboards drown out much of the other instruments \r\n(barring vocals and cymbals) 6 times out of 10, or so it seems.  On top of it, there are some \r\nkeyboard sounds that just grate my ears like nails on a chalkboard.  Martin Orford is very \r\nskilled and talented on the keys, and he's not given production credit, so none of my gripes \r\nare any of his fault; if anything, Orford is IQ's biggest asset on this album.<p>I have problems with the music itself as well.  It sounds like overly typical symphonic prog; \r\nthey piece together keyboard-led, odd timed themes together in a slightly connected \r\nmanner to achieve a typical prog piece.  I'd prefer something from the prog rock field that \r\ndidn't sound so routine or typical; hearing the same prog album over and over again wears \r\non my mind.  Plus, I find too many boring spots where themes just show up and leave \r\nwithout impact.  ''Corners'' is the worst example of my complaints as it is a six-minute-\r\napproaching-infinity type of song with the most soporific drumming (or drum machine, I \r\ncan't tell which), cliche sitar parts and a stuffy tempo.<p>Only parts of songs could stick out.  There's a spot on ''Widow's Peak'' right after the quiet \r\nbit in the middle that caught my attention, and the ''Chateau Noir'' bonus track has a nice \r\nstart.  That's really it as far as great memorable moments.  THE WAKE is not an album that \r\nhas any lasting impact with me.  It almost tries too hard to fit into the prog rock genre, and \r\nmost of the album sounds awkward because of it.<p>It'll test your prog fandom, but most will pass this test leaving me wearing the dunce cap in \r\nthat proverbial corner, listen after unsuccessful listen.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=245945#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=245945\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=245945\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, October 23, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #245945)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBack in '85 I was a huge Marillion fan. I remember being nailed to the ground when those first\r\nchords of Misplaced Childhood rang from my brother's room. I never checked out IQ though and judging\r\nfrom this album I didn't miss much. Marillion was obviously in debt to Genesis, Floyd and Hammill\r\nbut at least they sounded professional and quickly evolved into a personal style. A clone of the\r\nimitator was the last thing I was waiting for and that is exactly what IQ is. <p>There are a few differences with Marillion. First of all, if there's one enjoyable aspect about this\r\nalbum then it is the huge Steve Hackett influenced guitar playing of Mike Holmes. Steve Rothery was\r\nmore of a Gilmour/Latimer man. Mike Holmes is Hackett and he does it quite well. Also Martin Orford\r\nis good on keys. They are too loud in the mix but generally provide a good background atmosphere,\r\nvery reminiscent of 'soft-Genesis' ('75-'77 era) with a slightly melancholic twist.<p>The biggest distinction with Genesis / Marillion is the voice of Peter Nicholls. It is not reminding\r\nme of Gabriel and Collins at all. Unfortunately that is not a good thing as it is really\r\nunsatisfying and at times grating. On a track like <em>Outer Limits</em> he can hardly hold his tone.\r\nHis delivery is rather stale and lacks sense for melody. As a result the vocal lines are very\r\npredictable and unimaginative. Easily the worst vocals in prog since Chris Squire ;)<p>Given the general appraisal I had really hoped I would enjoy this album but it is second-rate\r\nreally. Wish I could close my ears to the vocals and just listen to the lush keys and guitars, that\r\nmight make it deserve one star more.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=254074#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=254074\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=254074\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 3, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #254074)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nUnlike Marillion I was introduced to IQ only recently when I purchased <em>Dark Matter</em> in 2007 and so far I've been met with a disappointment after disappointment on my quest to find the one great IQ release.<p>\r\n<em>The Wake</em> was my second IQ album because of its cult status in the Neo-Prog community. This release was IQ's breakthrough album that, together with Marillion's <em>Misplaced Childhood</em>, marked the new popular era of the genre. Although this album wasn't as successful as Marillion's work it paved the way for the sub-genre which makes the release equally important from the historical perspective. The mere fact that this band has been around since the early 80's and are still going strong they can't be ignored by any progressive rock fan.<p>\r\nI have very mixed thoughts regarding this release because I do enjoy the individual compositions whenever I listen to them but once I'm done listening to them my opinion completely evaporates into thin air and I struggle to remember what it is that makes <em>The Wake</em> great. Every song features that distinct '80s Neo-Prog style that we now consider to be the second coming of the progressive rock genre but my question is whether this music can be of interest to anyone who wasn't there when the genre reached its peak in 1985? I personally don't happen to think so. While <em>Misplaced Childhood</em> pleased both the prog fans and the mainstream audience this release was mainly for the underground prog community. The compositions do, in some cases, almost reach the level of Marillion's work on their debut album but I lack the strong personality that each of that band's members brought to the music. IQ can easily become very bland on the longer tracks and it's easy to forget that you're listening to them once Peter Nicholls' vocals are not around. This problem reoccurs on track after track throughout the album with an exception of <em>Headlong</em> which gives us a solid performance from the entire band and the only memorable instrumentally interplay between the instrumentalists.<p>\r\nTo put it in simple terms: <em>Misplaced Childhood</em> is a must have for fans of progressive rock while <em>The Wake</em> is a mainly of interest to Neo-Prog enthusiasts. All in all, a good, but non-essential release.<p>***** star songs: Headlong (7:30)<p>**** star songs: Outer Limits (8:14) The Wake (4:11) The Magic Roundabout (8:19) Widow's Peak (9:13)<p>*** star songs: Corners (6:21) The Thousand Days (5:12)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=279377#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=279377\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=279377\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, April 25, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #279377)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15596\"><strong>stefro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15596\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15596/STEF.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ produced two stunning albums during the early part of the 1980's, with 1983's 'Tales From The\r\nLush Attic' followed by this monster slice of neo-prog two years later. And, 30 years down the line,\r\nIQ have, despite a series of fine albums, yet to produce anything that can compare.\r\n'Tales From The Lush Attic' was, according to vocalist Pete Nicholls, rush-recorded in the space of\r\naround four days, which is absolutely staggering considering the complex, Genesis-inspired music on\r\nshow. 'The Wake', which was released in 1985, was the result of a slightly longer session, and found\r\nthis five-piece in truly inspired form, creating an enduring neo-prog odyssey that stands\r\nhead-and-shoulders above anything recorded by IQ's friendly genre rivals Marillion, Pendragon,\r\nTwelfth Night or Abel Ganz and, is still to this day, considered a milestone of 1980's progressive\r\nrock. The extra time in the recording studio obviously galvanised the group, and with the commercial\r\nsuccess of Marillion's 'Childhood's End' album fresh in the mind, IQ obviousy decided to add a layer\r\nof pop sheen to proceedings, recording a couple of genuinely-catchy prog-pop singles that fill out\r\nthe mid-section of 'The Wake' nicely. However, despite this nod towards the mainstream, IQ were\r\nstill firmly rooted in the prog camp. 'The Wake' is filled with complex keyboard riffs, glistening\r\nguitar solo's and intricate sounds that bely the group's low-budget recording conditions. Every\r\nsingle song is a winner, with the band flitting impressively between epic song-suites and\r\nbeautifully-judged ballads with expert aplomb and never, ever reverting to simple cliche or cloning;\r\nthis is a band who have a sound very much of their own. \r\nThe history books and pop charts will show that the kings of 1980's prog were, sale-wise, Marillion.\r\nHowever, despite their lack of genuine commercial success, IQ's first two albums are, simply put,\r\ntwo of the finest prog rock albums ever recorded. They have recorded many albums since, including\r\nthe mammoth two-disc concept album 'Subterranea' and their excellent 2009 release 'Frequency', but\r\nnone has come close to the mind-blowing creativity on offer here.\r\nIn a word, superb.\r\nSTEFAN TURNER, LONDON, 2010</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284272#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284272\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284272\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, May 30, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284272)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=30993\"><strong>zravkapt</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=30993\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/30993/42stupidcute.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is my first experience with this band. The only Neo-Prog I am familiar with is Marillion. In \r\nfact, other than IQ and Marillion, I think only Pendragon and Pallas are the only Neo bands I \r\nhave read anything about. I don't own this album...didn't even borrow it. I listened to it on a \r\nstreaming site. I won't mention which one because some of these streaming sites are legal in \r\nsome countries but not in others.<p>\r\nAfter listening to this album, I would say I prefer IQ to Marillion. I think Marillion and Magma \r\nhave something in common, let me explain. Both bands are considered the epitome of their \r\nown sub-genre, but are not necessarily the best band in their own sub-genres. If you want to \r\nget into Neo, you are automatically recommended Marillion; the same with Magma when it \r\ncomes to Zeuhl. This is not a good approach I feel. Had I been exposed to IQ first, I think I may \r\nhave warmed up to Neo more.<p>\r\nAlthough I found this a decent album, I'm still not going to convert to Neo anytime soon. This is \r\nobviously an '80s album with a strong Genesis influence(c. 1974-76 I would say). There is a \r\nimitation Mellotron sound here which isn't too bad. \"Outer Limits\" is very Genesis sounding, \r\nbut is still one of the better songs here. The title track is the song I enjoyed the most. A \r\nvery '80s sounding song with a good guitar solo. Maybe the lack of an overt 70s prog influence \r\nmakes me like this more.<p>\r\nThat song segues into \"The Magic Roundabout\", which I don't really care for. Very Gabriel \r\nsounding vocals here. \"Corners\" is interesting with the drum machine programming and use \r\nof sitar, but I think it's one of the weaker songs here. \"Widow's Peak\" is the longest song, but \r\nnot too great IMO. I have to mention the drumming in the first half, which is really good. \"The \r\nThousand Days\" is a mediocre '80s pop/rock song. Yuck. \"Headlong\" starts very Genesis-y. \r\nLater goes into a good beat with some decent synth soloing. The last two minutes or so is \r\nsome nice symphonic rock.<p>\r\nFor 1985 I guess this isn't too bad. Not sure if I will like other IQ albums as much as this. Will \r\nhave to find out. For The Wake, I give 3 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=366222#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=366222\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=366222\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 28, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #366222)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's first masterpiece is The Wake, a concept album about a protagonist undergoing \r\nphantasmagoric experiences as he comes to terms with the fact that he's died and learns to let \r\ngo of his earthly connections as he passes to an uncertain fate. Distilling the Genesis-\r\ninfluenced approach of Tales From the Lush Attic into tighter, more carefully composed tracks \r\nand showing an adept ability to include a few crowd-pleasing mainstream rock elements into \r\ntheir sound without compromising the emotional and conceptual integrity of the piece (as on \r\nThe Thousand Days), the album shows a far greater diversity of sound and mood than its \r\npredecessor, with songs ranging from the foreboding Outer Limits to the relaxing Corners (one \r\nof the few neo-prog tracks I'm aware of which includes an indo-prog influence thanks to the \r\ninclusion of sitar) to the uplifting, soaring Thousand Days and Headlong.<p>As far as the band's performances go, the interplay of Mike Holmes' guitar and Martin Orford's \r\nsynths has rarely been equalled, whilst Peter Nicholls' dramatic, theatrical vocal delivery is \r\nexcellent on this album. He left the band after this one to pursue his Niadem's Ghost \r\nsabbatical, and I'd go so far as to say that even if he'd never returned he'd still have a strong \r\nclaim to being IQ's best vocallist based on his work here. Indeed, if IQ had vanished into \r\nobscurity or sold out utterly after this point they'd still have a warm reputation in neo-prog circles \r\nthanks to this classic; luckily for us, they had more classics up their sleeve.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=583486#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=583486\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=583486\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 6, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #583486)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's \"The Wake\" is a Neo prog triumph in the earlier years of the group before I even knew they existed. \r\nAfter hearing some of their albums of recent years it was a necessary deed to return to IQ's back log. \r\nThe album is akin to the music of Marillion, especially the vocals that sound very Fish like, and that is \r\nnot a bad thing.  <p>Some of the standout tracks include the majesty of 'The Wake' with a synth soaked melody driven \r\ncomposition, augmented by Peter Nicholls' excellent vocals and ambience. 'The Magic Roundabout' \r\nhas a glorious intro with swathes of keyboards, by Martin Orford, and some very reflective vocals, with \r\nheartfelt phrases such as \"I can't deny the honesty\", and \"if life is still worth living how come I feel \r\nalone.\" It sounds downbeat but it is a pleading vocal that reaches out for help, and I think many could \r\nrelate to some of these thoughts. The guitars on this are superb, played by Mike Holmes, transfixing \r\nwith twin layered effects. The time sig change that kicks in sends the song into an uptempo vibe, and a \r\nwonderful extended coda. <p>'Widow's Peak' begins with tranquil acoustics, and a steadily building atmosphere of synths and \r\ncymbal swells. The flute sound is beautiful, and it patiently leads to an outbreak of keys and drums. The \r\nvocals come in nicely with Nicholls' clear voice that I have become very accustomed to. The music \r\nsparkles with glittering synth and an odd rhythmic percussion by Paul Cook. The lead break is nicely \r\nexecuted as usual, and the song eventually moves to an interlude of instrumentation with layers of \r\nsynths and ambient guitar textures. The sound beautifully resonates with atmospherics until the \r\nFloydian reverberated guitar, like 'Run Like Hell' to be more specific, and I like the way the synths \r\nplunge into chord shapes. The time sig shifts meter again and there is a strong beat that crashes \r\nthrough. A cello sound is heard for a time and then another verse before it ends; a veritable master class \r\nof prog.<p>'The Thousand Days' has a more commercial sound like a single from the album, but I like the melody \r\nvery much and it has a bright vibe that is breezy and light. The twin harmonics on the lead guitar solo \r\nare a delight.<p>'Headlong' is very quiet, with vocals crying out and some keyboards to accompany. It builds with a bell \r\ntolling and tinkling chimes, providing a mystical quality. An outburst of drums and heavy guitar with \r\nsynth layers eventually dominates. The keyboard solo is one of the best on the album. This one has a \r\ntension and release structure, with lighter moments embellished by heavier passages. The ending \r\nmusical coda reminds me of Genesis in some aspects.   <p>'Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir' has some mesmirising passages of synthesizer and a labyrinthine \r\nstructure with time shifts and lengthy instrumentals. The mid-section with synths and howling wind \r\nbefore the strings chime in is a moment to savour. The lead guitar with sustained string bends is \r\ntransfixing, followed by hammer ons and speed picking, certainly brilliant guitar playing here from Mike \r\nHolmes.   <p>Overall this early IQ album is a sign of things to come. It has since been bettered by the likes of the \r\nbrilliant \"Frequency\", but in 1985 this was pure prog of the highest quality. 3 and a half sparkling stars.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=794975#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=794975\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=794975\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, July 26, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #794975)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter the rushed debut album \"Tales From The Lush Attic\" which turned out brilliantly albeit not to the band's satisfaction, the band \r\nspent a lot more time and money on their follow-up THE WAKE which was indeed riding the new wave of 80s progressive rock that \r\nthey, Marillion and Pallas were ushering in to revive a sub genre of rock that was experiencing an increasingly decrease of listeners \r\nand at this time was only being kept on life support by the hardcore proggers of the day. All this special attention was particularly \r\npaid to fine tuning more accessible sounds and song structures that helped THE WAKE hit the market and become the only album of \r\ntheir lengthy discography to enter the UK album chart albeit for only one week and peaking at a mere #72. However the tides were \r\nclearly turning as the new neo-prog movement had taken root and with albums like THE WAKE and Marillion's \"Misplaced Childhood\" \r\nthat was released at the same time, it was clear that a revival was taking place and the momentum was increasing after every new \r\nrelease.<p>THE WAKE is a concept album where each track is based on the psychological traumas that haunt the soul of a recently deceased \r\nman, who after having passed away recounts his earthly existence (\"The Outer Limits\") and laments the unfolding events in a state \r\nof regret and remorse (\"The Wake\"). He begins to see an illuminating light in front of him (\"The Magic Roundabout\") but fears the \r\nconsequences of going near it so he decides to hide in the nooks and crannies of limbo while he works out his anguish (\"Corners\"). \r\nAs he reflects on his physical life that he has recently left, he focuses primarily on his relationship with his wife (\"Widow's Peak\") and \r\nafter an adequate amount of self-reflection he becomes enlightened and understands that the unfolding tale of his experiences in \r\nthe physical plane were necessary for spiritual growth (\"The Thousand Days\"). He ultimately comes to peace with it all, leaves the \r\ndark crevices of limbo and heads back to the light (\"Headlong\").<p>Musically this is a much more diverse album than \"Tales From The Lush Attic.\" While there are still progressive lengthy tracks here, \r\nthe musical style relies more in pop-infused hooks that incorporate synthpop aspects of the era especially with the programmed \r\nsounding drums on \"Corners,\" a trait that would carry on the following two albums where the band abandoned much of its \r\nprogressive qualities in favor of more accessible material. THE WAKE certainly stepped up IQ's compositional fortitude as far as \r\ndistancing themselves from the Marillion comparisons of the debut. While the Genesis connections are still in full force with Banks-\r\nesque keyboards, Hackett inspired guitar runs and the face-painted theatrical Gabriel flair of lead vocalist Peter Nicholls, the \r\ncompositions are beginning to sound uniquely theirs thus expanding the neo-prog style in their own direction that they would \r\ncontinue to steer down their own progressive highway. <p>While i don't find this release to be my absolute favorite of the lot i have to give it credit for its accomplishments and pleasant \r\nlistenability. If you happen to like this one a lot more than i do, you may even consider splurging on the four disc 25th anniversary \r\nedition completely remastered which contains rare videos, demos, a double sided poster and a 60-page booklet with every possible \r\nthing under the sun about this album. For me, i'm happy just having this simple original version sans bonus tracks and letting the \r\noriginal music as intended stand on its own two feet which presents the tale of a soul struggling to make sense of his life that didn't \r\nwork out exactly the way he had hoped. Lyrically an interesting concept that slaps us with concepts of unknown afterlife experience \r\nand musically another evolutionary step up the symphonic prog rock arena.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1535121#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1535121\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1535121\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, March 3, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1535121)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11816\"><strong>Modrigue</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11816\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11816/PA-Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>The Wake of IQ?</strong><p>1985 was an important year for the development of the neo-progressive genre. IQ's \"The Wake\" was\r\nsecond to MARILLION's (overrated) album \"Misplaced Childhood\" in terms of notoriety, however I\r\npersonally prefer PENDRAGON's debut \"The Jewel\". This third album is the last 80's IQ's record\r\nfeaturing singer Peter Nicholls, and therefore marks the end of the band's first period.<p>Musically, the style is roughly the same as on its predecessor \"Tales From The Lush Attic\". However,\r\nthe band matured and begins to define their identity by digesting their initial Gabriel-GENESIS\r\nroots, even if they're still noticeable. The compositions on \"The Wake\" are shorter and rather\r\nkeyboards-driven, but also more coherent and with better sound quality. All this creates a\r\nparticular atmosphere mixing darkness, melancholic, hope and joy, that will later become IQ's\r\ntrademark. Each song narrates a step of reincarnation, from death to the beginning of a new life.\r\n \r\nThe best track is the catchy opener \"Outer Limits\". It contains a depressive synthesizer overture,\r\npowerful and melancholic moments and various soli. A classic from the band. Typical of neo-prog, the\r\nenjoyable title track alternates somber, oppressive and bright moments. Then comes \"The Magic\r\nRoundabout\" with its spacey introduction, heroic rocking and calm passages and great finale. This\r\npiece is however uneven as it can unfortunately get a bit soapy at times.<p>\"Corners\" is one the weak tracks of the record with its dated percussions and useless sitar, whereas\r\nthe very nice \"Widow's Peak\" is the longest and most progressive composition. The first half shows\r\nstrong early-GENESIS influences, but with eighties sonorities and spacey keyboards. The second half\r\nis rock-ier with its floating guitar \u00e0 la Steve Hillage. A magical fairytale song. In contrast, the\r\njoyful \"The Thousand Days\" is a cheesy 80's pop track. You can have a preview of IQ's material\r\nduring the late 80's here... The soft melancholic \"Headlong\" also features changing atmospheres but\r\nthe result is average this time.<p>The bonus track \"Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir\" is one of IQ's best 80's compositions. An enchanting\r\nand haunting piece, essential for IQ fans...<p>Less adventurous but more mature than \"Tales From The Lush Attic\", less rock and more synthesized\r\nthan its predecessor, \"The Wake\" is also unequal but overall pleasant. The musicians offers\r\nambiances from another world and therefore begins to become IQ, slowly emancipating from their 70's\r\nprogressive roots. Don't miss this disc if you're an IQ or a neo-prog fan.<p>As in the album, the band will have to die to revive again. After the departure of Peter Nicholls,\r\nthe members will recruit singer Paul Menel for the next two albums, much more commercial oriented.\r\nThe fans will have to wait 8 years for another IQ studio opus with Nicholls, and also with this\r\nquality. However, this next reincarnation will result in one of their best records... ever...</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1564931#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1564931\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1564931\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, May 15, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1564931)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHow ironic that the engineer of this terrible sounding album is given special credit alongside the musicians! A little too<p>1. \"Outer Limits\" (8:15) for the first half of this song it's very 80s New Wave sounding, but when electric guitar starts its seering leads and the bass pedals kick in in the fifth minute, it becomes real prog. (16/20)<p>2. \"The Wake\" (4:11) a horrible vocal to not match the tenuous music. Weird. Nice guitar solo. (7.5/10)<p>3. \"The Magic Roundabout\" (8:18) Really? Did we really have to choose this title? And then try a \"Watcher in the Skies\"-like extended intro? I must admit, I rather love the tone of the lead guitar. (Kind of Flock of Seagulls-like.) Horrible vocal. What's happened to Peter Nicholls? (15/20)<p>4. \"Corners\" (6:20) \"Man on the Corner\"? Better vocal. (7.5/10)<p>5. \"Widow's Peak\" (9:12) nice atmosphere established by the spacious opening. Kicks into gear nicely except I hate the use of a swish cymbal for the four-beat crash hits. Otherwise, this is the best song on the album and Peter Nicholls best performance. Only problem is how totally GENESIS this sounds. (17.5/20)<p>6. \"The Thousand Days\" (5:12) another song that sounds so much like the 80s?and especially 80s GENESIS. Nice work with the keys for the final 90 seconds. (8/10)<p>7. \"Headlong\" (7:25) Opens with a gentle harpsichord-like guitar and keys with a nice, touching vocal. In the third minute, after Peter's first verse is finished, a thick bass and drums rise from below for an instrumental section. Then everything drops away for a return of the sentimental vocal's second verse. Unfortunately, there's nothing very new or fresh here. (12/15)<p>Total time 48:53<p>Bonus \"Dans le parc du chateau noir\" (7:37) Peter's first real attempt at a serious Peter Gabriel impersonation (with a little Hammill-ishness thrown in there for good measure). Sounds SO MUCH like 1978 BABYLON album. Nice drumming. Great guitar. My other favorite song on the album. (13.5/15)<p>In its original state, without the bonus track, I give this album a C+/three stars; with the bonus track at B-/3.5 stars.  <p>  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1705845#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1705845\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1705845\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, March 28, 2017</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1705845)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=421\"><strong>Menswear</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=421\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/421/nels&#111;n_happy.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe Green Album.<p>Sporting a weird art cover, The Wake surely attracts the eye: what is this?!? To me it's the Green Album. What does it talk about? I'\r\nI'm not sure, really. The lyrics are cryptic, as usual, but 'Never sleeping, I saw my abduction from Solid areas fallen with grace' an\r\nand such prose staggers my mind with interrogation signs. What is he talking about? I'm not even sure they know themselves!<p>I was 9 years old when this record came out and if I had a chance to discover it at the time, I would tell you right away that it's a \r\nlong way from Duran Duran (my big fav at the time). I would've also tell you that it's very, very colorful and enigmatic; I mean, wh\r\nwhy is there a sad clown on the cover?<p>I'm aware of all the comparison between The Wake and Misplaced Childhood. Many will say that Childhood is much more \r\naccomplished, polished and coherent. The art of Childhood is irresistible, the songs are more dramatic and it creates a much \r\ndeeper impact on the mind. Agreed, Childhood is one hell of a classic and breeded countless clones, more bad ones than good. \r\nBut IQ created on his side a weirder monster from the 'Genesis' ashes, and this is were I'm signing in. IQ injects much more \r\nbombastic energy, almost yelling out it's message. IQ let the heartaches out and invites the dynamic theatrics in, pushing you to \r\nlisten more carefully. <p>IQ gave birth to something unique, colorful, thickly foggy and LOUD, in a parallel lane of Marillion, but never rejoining. This is a ma\r\nmammoth of an album that rocks the crap out the 80's. It's less for girls, no soapy ballads or romantic touches, it paints an epic ca\r\ncanvas in deafening rocking colors. <p>To be able to pull out such a vigorous rabbit out of their hat and giving life back to a dying art is a reason in itself to call it a \r\nclassic. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2041686#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2041686\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2041686\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 6, 2018</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2041686)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5589\"><strong>The Crow</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5589\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5589/diesiraebox_sheetmusic041.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's second album brought us a much more mature band with an obviously consolidated sound compared to their \r\ndebut!<p>In fact, in \"The Wake\" we can already hear a preview of what would be the band's great albums in the 90s such as \r\n\"Ever\" or \"Subterranea\".<p>Unfortunately, after recording this album, Peter Nichols was absent for almost 10 years, causing a sound change that \r\nwould not be recovered until the aforementioned \"Ever\".<p>In any case, this \"The Wake\" remains as a testimony of the great capacity that this band already had in its beginnings, \r\noffering one of the best neo-progressive albums of the 80s, despite the fact that naturally the production is already \r\nsomewhat dated.<p>Best Tracks: Outer Limits (great signature bass line, and some impressive keyboard solos in the instrumental sections), \r\nThe Magic Roundabout (my favorite of the album, with another absolutely stunning bass line), Widows Peak (another \r\ngreat IQ's trademark song, with a Peter Nichols using a somewhat deeper tone that suits the theme quite well) and \r\nHeadlong (splendid and epic composition)<p>My Rating: ****\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2710194#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2710194\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2710194\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, March 15, 2022</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2710194)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=69885\"><strong>Hector Enrique</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=69885\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/69885/tool_ojo.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn the midst of the complex context faced by the bands that were the standard bearers in the revitalisation of the \r\nprogressive movement, not only to resist the onslaught of the new musical currents of the decade, but also to deal \r\nwith the scepticism that lurked in the specialised critics regarding the originality and value of their initiatives, IQ \r\nreleased their second album, \"The Wake\", in 1985. A conceptual work related to the sensitive and mysterious \r\ntransition from earthly life to the unknown afterlife as a plot (a theme that with the corresponding hostile, bloody and \r\nthunderous nuances is also dealt with by Opeth in their \"My Arms, Your Hearse\" from 1998) to develop a proposal that \r\ngoes through moments of darkness, despair and luminous hope.<p>Already from the energised and initial \"Outer Limits\" with Tim Esau's low and disturbing bass hits simulating the \r\nbeating of a heart about to be extinguished accompanied by Martin Orford's eighties synth artillery and Paul Cook's \r\nraw drums, and the melodic verses of the eloquent Peter Nicholls reinforced by Mike Holmes' brief but determined \r\nguitar solo in the aggressive \"The Wake\", the influences of the Genesian universe sifted by IQ's particular style overfly \r\nthe album; both in the changing \"The Magic Roundabout\" and Orford's anguished and anxious keyboards backed by \r\nEsau's marked bass in its prolonged and forceful introduction, and in the world music essay of \"Corners\" with the \r\ninteresting sitar as protagonist, a piece in the style of the Peter Gabriel of those years. <p>And without leaving aside their progressive streak as a guide, IQ was not aseptic to the musical trend of that time, new \r\nwave elements (of bands like Cure or A Flock of Seagulls for example) are perceived in the guitar riffs of the extensive \r\n\"Widow's Peak\" and above all in those of the accelerated \"The Thousand Days\", before bringing the album to a close \r\nwith the emotive optimism of \"Headlong\", one of the pieces that began to cement the style that would help define the \r\nEnglishmen over the years.<p>Although \"The Wake\" is a good album, as well as a key piece for the consolidation of the band and the Neo Progressive \r\nmovement, in my opinion it is a step below the freshness and daring that their debut album \"Tales from the Lush \r\nAttic\" brought with it. <p>3/3.5 stars\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3035585#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3035585\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3035585\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, April 5, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=609#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3035585)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=56081\"><strong>VianaProghead</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=56081\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/1/cover_404762112008.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" title=\"VianaProghead avatar\" width=100 alt=\"VianaProghead avatar\" onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n                                    Review N\u00ba 824<p>The band was formed in 1981 by two friends who were part of the recently extinct band The Lens, Mike Holmes and \r\nMartin Orford. They recruited Mark Ridout and Tim Esau and formed IQ. The band had already created several \r\ncompositions, and as soon as they got together, they started recording their first demos. Their musical proposal \r\ninitially consisted of mixing several musical styles into one, always with a progressive theme. In the beginning, the \r\nthemes were basically instrumentals due to the absence of a vocalist. They ended up finding one, an old acquaintance \r\nvocalist, Peter Nicholls, a friend of Martin and Mike that was part of The Lens for a while. Just over a month after Peter \r\njoined, Mark left the group, being replaced by Paul Cook. With a stable line up the band played several shows around \r\nEngland and released their first cassette album \"Seven Stories Into Eight\". With constant gigging throughout UK they \r\nreleased their first real vinyl album \"Tales From The Lush Attic\" in 1983 and the second \"The Wake\", but only in 1985.<p>So, \"The Wake\" is the second studio album of IQ and that was released in 1985. The line up on the album is Peter \r\nNicholls (vocals and tambourine), Mike Holmes (guitars), Martin Orford (backing vocals, synthesizer, organ, Mellotron \r\nand flute), Tim Esau (bass guitar) and Paul Cook (drums and percussion).<p>\"The Wake\" is a development compared with \"Tales From The Lush Attic\". The tracks have become more compact and \r\nthe sound is more professional and produced. The compositions are long (five out of seven tracks exceed six minutes) \r\nand contains all the ingredients of the 70's prog. The recipe is simple but still works just as well for the pleasure of our \r\nears. Slow or even hovering introductions, explosion of synths and guitar supported by a powerful bass drum rhythmic \r\nline, the presence of the Mellotron and the Nicholls' voice, may reinforce the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu, but keeps as essential.<p>\"The Wake\" has seven tracks. All tracks were written by IQ. With the first track \"Outer Limits\" you can immediately hear \r\nthe typical signature sound of the band. This is rather a thin track. Here, we can hear the darkness, followed by some \r\nlighter parts and then we are back again to the darkness. So, we can say that this piece ends as it begins. The second \r\ntrack is the title track \"The Wake\". Despite the track, especially due to the sound of the keyboards reminds me of some \r\nof the classic songs of Genesis, we even can see that it's IQ that we're hearing due to the usual patterns used by them. \r\nDark followed by light and back to the darkness. This is a very powerful track with some great instrumental work. The \r\nthird track \"The Magic Roundabout\" is one of the lighter songs on the album. No darkness here. This is just a song to \r\ncool down with a more melancholic spirit. The keyboards and the guitar harmonize the melody perfectly well.  Not as \r\nepic as the two previous tracks, but it can be also great with its dreamy mood. The fourth track \"Corners\" is sparsely \r\norchestrated. Slowly, one instrument after the other kicks in. Personally, this is my least favourite song on the album. \r\nThe main reason for that are the drums. They sound like a backing track from a keyboard. This isn't a bad track that \r\ncan sound funny, but I really don't like of its electronic structure mixed with reggae. This isn't a great number, indeed. \r\nThe fifth track \"Widow's Peak\" is the best piece on the album that rightly became a band's classic. The track starts with \r\na guitar part that is supported by the keyboards which, suddenly, the part changes from minor to major, followed by a \r\nvery happy part. Even the vocals are kick and great here. In general, this is one of my all time IQ's favourite tracks. The \r\nsixth track \"The Thousand Days\" is a decent poppy song of the 80's. It starts with a nice riff of Holmes and a great bass \r\nline of Esau that support very well the nice and consistent works of Orford and Cook. Despite it isn't properly a true \r\nprog track, it still is, really, an enjoyable and a guilty pleasure to listen to. The seventh track \"Headlong\" is the second \r\nhighlight next to \"Widow's Peak\". Here you can hear what is so characteristic and fascinating about the voice of Peter \r\nNicholls, an almost tearful, fragile and wistful timbre. The track begins with a sad mood about the shedding of the \"old\" \r\nlife to a \"new\" one. In the end it changes from the initial sadness, hopeless one to a slightly lively, almost defiant one.<p>Conclusion: \"The Wake\" is, definitely, a classic prog album. Together with Marillion's first albums, it helped to define \r\nwhat neo-prog would be and generated dozens of sound-alike albums by as many bands in the U.K. and worldwide. If \r\nyou've seen the list with all the albums that Steven Wilson has in his playlist you'll find this album in it along with their \r\nalbum \"Tales From Lush Attic\". \"The Wake\" is a much contrasted album where you can hear the real IQ's sound, a tasty \r\nmix of brilliance and darkness, sometimes cheerful, sometimes oppressive and sometimes frightening. However, the \r\nband doesn't deny their influences. But, what could be considered pure plagiarism in \"Tales From The Lush Attic\", is \r\nnow becoming more of a cultural heritage, a kind of lineage. In a way, IQ is the spiritual son of Marillion and Genesis' \r\ngrandson. \"The Wake\" is a great album. Everyone who likes the typical progressive rock sound should have this album.<p>Prog is my Ferrari.
