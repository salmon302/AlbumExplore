This album took Maiden to yet again the next level. \r\nProduction-wise the sound is a bit grittier than what came before and what would come \r\nnext, but it just adds to the overall sound. Bruce's voice is becoming even more \r\namazing than the previous album. He hits notes no man could touch in rock before (he'd \r\nsurpass himself in following albums) The prog influences show more on this album than \r\nbefore as well.<p>The album opens with one of the best songs on the album Where Eagles Dare. Intricate \r\ndrums are one of the highlights. Extremely melodic guitar parts carry the song. The \r\nmiddle instrumental section is so powerful and builds great tension, VERY Genesis-like in \r\nthis song. The vocals aren't really a big part of the song since Dickinson sings very little \r\non this song, but the climatic end to the song, Bruce sings so emotionally that you know \r\nright away, this a great song.<p>Revelations and Flight of Icarus are excellent tunes, again, very epic and melodic. \r\nCatchy melodies all around, you can't escape them. Great harmonies in the vocal \r\ndepartment as well, especially on FoI, which leads right into...<p>...THE TROOPER! Easily the best song on the album and probably Maiden's most well \r\nknown song. Sure they play it live a lot (like EVERY show since this album came out) but \r\nif you've heard the song, you know why. Everything is perfect on this song. Best \r\nmelody, galloping bass riffs, fantastic solos from both Smith and Murray, and of course \r\none of Dickinson's most shining moments \"OOOH OH OH OH WHOAH OH OH AH OH\". \r\nClassic.<p>The second half isn't 'as' good as the first, but doesnt say much, since it still consists of \r\nexcellent material.<p>Still Life, Quest for Fire, and Sun and Steel are great metal songs, sometimes actually \r\nplaying in a major key, which adds a different sound to the overall \"Maiden Sound\". \r\nNothing is wrong with these songs, they just dont live up to The Trooper's superiority.<p>The last song is the epic To Tame a Land. This is a dark song, quite the opposite from \r\nthe previous 2 or 3 songs. The bass is the feature on this track, playing some haunting \r\nmelodies with the guitars counterpointing the basslines. It ends a bit anit-climatic but \r\nstill a great song.<p>Essential of Maiden's catalouge, for The Trooper and Where Eagles Dare alone, but the \r\nrest of the albums owns as well.<p>GET!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93115#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93115\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93115\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93115)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n2.5 stars really!!<p>With finally a stable line-up for a few albums to come, with Nico McBrain (ex early-Pat Travers Band drummer), the group has now a steady drummer, the Maiden will now produce a series of classic 80's metal (which I must recognize is not really my cup of tea), even though one can say that right from the debut, they are all masters in the genre. <p>With Dickinson instantly recognizable voice, the group sails smooth seas, cruising speeds that can be only envied by other NWOBHMB, IM is just content on convincing already conqured metal public. The least we can say is that with this album, Maiden is not on to break new ground (they never were, but with this one even less than other albums of theirs), so this album has an \"already-seen\" flavour that makes us casual fans wonder why we actually would consider buying YET ANOTHER Maiden album.  Indeed, there is nothing new under the metallic sun. The usual two or three shorter tracks (Flight of Icarus, The Trooper, Sun And Steel) to provide potential hits (the first one anyway), longer material to provide a bit of dramas veering towards what complacent fans will call mini-epics (nothing over the 7.5 minutes though) and a few lower quality fillers: one has to learn not to overflow an album of ideas so there are more for the next albums to come (hey career consultancy exists in metal groups also). Yes they got their formula down pat: they even allow for the odd extremely well placed slow intro to give a breathing space to the young metalhead in between the riff-erama heaven that every young male into tough music only dreams to reach. Maiden's professional attitude is to achieve this on a few occasions per record, something that most of their peers could simply not match. <p>I usually cannot listen ton such an album in its entirety without developing a start of a migraine, this was the case already when I was in my 20's, but is certainly more the case nowadays. Which is why compassionate progheads are welcome to express their sympathies in a sealed envelope (along with consequent financial gratitude ;-) after I put up with two recent listening session of this album in order to write this review.<p>So Maiden with not invent hot water and in case they did invent lukewarm water, it was rather by accident rather than by an adventurous approach: every step of this album is well-thought out, but that quality is also its weakness: no surprise, no real fun, just business as usual. By winning without risks, one triumphs without glory. Lacklustre for me, but triumphant for convinced fans, the choice is yours.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93155#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93155\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93155\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 3, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93155)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden produced a really professionally recorded heavy metal album here: the sound \r\nis VERY sharp, the tracks are structured, the instruments are more synchronized than \r\never, the tones are crystal clear, and the electric guitars are REALLY razor and disciplined. \r\nThe drums are outstanding, especially on \"Where eagles dare\". Harris' bass is, as always, \r\nfast, restless and very elaborated: he sometimes plays catchy & melodic patterns of high \r\nnotes, like on \"Die with your boots on\" and \"Quest for fire\". There are MANY MELODIC and \r\nclean guitar solos. The previous \"Number of the Beast\" album sounds less crystal clear. \r\nDickinson's lead & backing vocals are very good and catchy, like on \"Sun & steel\", \"Quest \r\nfor fire\" and \"Flight of Icarus\". The very structured \"To tame a land\" can be classified as a \r\nmetal prog song. \"Piece of mind\" as only a few more mellow moments, like some bits \r\non \"Revelations\" and \"To tame a land\". ALL the tracks are excellent. The album sounds a \r\nbit like \"Powerslave\", except the tracks here sound more varied. \"Piece of mind\" is one of \r\ntheir best albums. <p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93548#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93548\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93548\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 5, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93548)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nMy first introduction to Iron Maiden only happened in year 2000 when I was listening\r\nto  M97 - The Classic Rock FM radio station in Jakarta, Indonesia, while I was\r\ndriving. I immediately called the station and got the song title and artist: It was\r\n\"Flight of Icarus\" from Iron Maiden \"Piece of Mind\". What an excellent song! To me,\r\nmusic is emotion and \"Flight of Icarus\" was successful in creating that emotion to me\r\nregardless the sub-genre of the music - and I didn't care, really. So I purchased the\r\nCD and I played track 3 repetitively - probably 6 to 8 spins only for track 3. Why do\r\nI like the track? It's really great music combining excellent guitar riffs, dynamic\r\nbass lines and great double guitar work. The vocal part is really clean and powerful.\r\nAnd of course. the chorus line is so memorable .\"Fly on your way, like an eagle. Fly\r\nas high as the sun, on your way, like an eagle. Fly and touch the sun.\". Wow! What a\r\ngreat music segment this one is!<p>It was quite a big shock to me that this band is finally featured here at this site.\r\nI actually consider the band as a hard rock / metal band as most of its structure are\r\nstraight hard rock music. But it's okay .. again .. music is emotion, my friend! Why\r\ndebating \"prog or non prog?\" Just enjoy the music full stop. And this \"Piece of Mind\"\r\nis definitely a hard rock music with good rhythm section and powerful vocal line. As\r\nI knew the band quite late - about 20 years after its inception (of course I heard\r\nthe name but I never heard the music as I don't like its cover - so boring to me).\r\nI'm not the right person to talk about who's who Iron Maiden is but for sure I like\r\nthis album.<p>Having listened to track 3, finally I made an attempt to listen to other tracks and I\r\nwas quite surprised that there are good tracks as well. The opening track \"Where\r\nEagles Dare\" (6:11) resembles good composition with double guitar work in which each\r\nguitar player contributes different kind of style. It reminds me to Wishbone Ash as\r\nwell. I start to enjoy this album as this opening track is a good one to enjoy.\r\n\"Revelations\" (6:48) continues similar style as opening track with double guitar\r\nfills at opening part. The music moves with nice guitar riffs combined with nice\r\nchorus line where guitar fills are really good.<p>\"Die With Your Boots On\" (5:29) is another good composition with soft guitar riffs.\r\n\"The Trooper\" (4:11) is the band's classic where it was also used as Metal program\r\nmusic for the M97 FM Station. This song has a powerful and memorable riffs and\r\nexcellent music flows using guitar that serves dual roles.  \"Still Life\" (4:53) is\r\nprobably a track with some prog touch - at least at its structure which contains\r\n\"curved\" segments. \"To Tame a Land\" (7:27) is to me like an epic with long form music\r\nand varied styles. The composition is good and it has a balanced combination of hard\r\nand soft parts - all are delivered with powerful vocal and nice double guitar work.\r\nThis is not to miss for any of you who love rock music. <strong>Keep on rockin'\r\n..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93664#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93664\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93664\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 7, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93664)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nPiece of Mind is the sophomore effort with Bruce Dickinson in the band. The band\r\ncontinues to write solid metal music here. All the elements of Iron Maiden are here,\r\nbut I have a problem with it. There's no progression, no adventure. It just sounds as\r\nif Iron Maiden just threw a bunch of songs of the same style, making this album\r\nnon-essential. <p><strong> Where Eagles Dare </strong> is a rare excellent opener, as many openers are just a\r\ntypical catchy fast paced metal song. Yes, it's fast paced. Yes, it's catchy, but\r\nthis one is also an excellent piece of music, with interesting riffs and an extended\r\nguitar solo. <strong> Revelations </strong> is another long song. It's well done and all, but\r\nit just doesn't grab me that much. Maybe the riffs are not as imaginative as they\r\nwere in the previous albums. Same goes for <strong> Flight of the Icarus </strong>, but I have\r\nto admit that the chorus is interesting, with the vocal harmonies and the drum beats\r\nthat are introduced when the vocals go \"Like an eagle.\" <strong> Die with your Boots on\r\n</strong> also sounds like anything that's been done before, with uninteresting riffs and\r\nsolos, but this one is worse because of the horrible vocal harmonies present.\r\nFortunately, the next song redeems the worst song. <strong> The Trooper </strong> is easily the\r\nbest song of the album, with a genius use of double guitars, insanely catchy guitar\r\nriffs, wonderful rhythms, superb guitar solo, and the sublime harmonized chorus hook.\r\n<strong> Still Life </strong> is a nice straightforward song that has better riffs and ideas\r\n(like the mellow intro)  than the songs preceding \"The Trooper.\" The next two songs\r\nare unremarkable but <strong> To Tame a Land </strong>, while not on the same level of Phantom\r\nof the Opera,  is a very strong mini-epic with a mellow intro and solid songwriting.\r\nThere are many brilliant musical moments throughout this song and if I'm not\r\nmistaken, Harris called it the best song he has ever written, at least up to that point.<p>The reason to get this album is mainly the great opener, the epic closer, and the\r\nshort perfection that is \"The Trooper\". The rest ranges from poor to good. There are\r\nmany other albums you could buy instead of this one, but if you are a fan of the band\r\nand possess their best album, it won't hurt to get this.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104603#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104603\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=104603\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 26, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #104603)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn the liner notes the band says  \"No synthesisers or ulterior motives\". And they also \r\nsay \"To all the headbangers, earthdogs, hell rats and rivetheads everywhere-THANKS\".\r\nThis record is one of my desert island discs. And I agree with greenback that the big \r\ndifference between this one and \"Powerslave\" is the variety found on \"Piece Of Mind\".<p>\r\n\"Where Eagles Dare\" is truly an amazing song with Nicko's drumming really standing \r\nout. And of course Bruce's vocals are incredible throughout. I still remember driving along \r\nside the Niagara River approaching the Falls on our honeymoon on a hot and \r\nhumid afternoon with this song absolutely blasting out of car. Ah, the good old \r\ndays. \"Revelations\" has a lot of tempo changes. Starting out slowly but powerfully things \r\naccelerate quickly when Bruce yells \"go\". There are such beautiful guitar melodies in this \r\nsong as well as the galloping rythym that IRON MAIDEN is famous for. There is a scathing \r\nguitar solo after 4 minutes. Excellent !<p>\"Flight Of Icarus\" has a thunderous intro of bass and \r\ndrums that is ground shaking. There is a screaming guitar solo and the song ends with \"the \r\nhuman siren\" belting it out. \"Die With Your Boots On\" is a straight ahead rocker with vocal \r\nharmonies from the rest of the band. Great guitar solo 3 minutes in.This song gets better \r\nas it goes. \"The Trooper\" starts off running, and the guitar melodies are some of the best \r\nthese ears have ever heard. The melody is galloping now and Bruce's vocals are \r\npowerful, this can't be played too loud. \"Still Life\" opens with a change of pace, even Bruce's \r\nvocals are reserved. But this all changes rather quickly as pounding drums introduce an \r\nuptempo melody the rest of the way. \"Quest For Fire\" is a good song about the cave man \r\ndays, with an atmospheric guitar solo. \"Sun And Steel\" is a straight forward rock tune with a \r\ngalloping rhythm. \"To Tame A Land\" is an amazing song ! It's really a journey with great \r\nlyrics. There is a guitar solo over top of the rhythm of heavy drums and bass as the tension \r\nbuilds.<p>\r\nI can't recommend this album high enough, this is classic MAIDEN !</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104812#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104812\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=104812\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 28, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #104812)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11104\"><strong>1800iareyay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe Number of the Beast, along with the first two albums, had cemented Iron Maiden \r\nas one of the leaders of the NWOBHM movement. The addition of Bruce Dickinson had \r\nushered in an entirely new approach for Maiden; rather than Di'Anno's punky growl, the \r\nband now had a singer who could give the vocals an operatic bent, soaring above the \r\nthunderous noise of the guitars and drums. This resulted in Maiden soon diverting from \r\nmore striaghtforward traditional metal to the fantasy-themed power metal, which they \r\nwould soon conquer. Piece of Mind shows the completion of the classic lineup with new \r\ndrummer Nicko McBrain. His inventive yet simple kitwork would complement Steve's \r\ngalloping basslines like no previous drummer could.  It also marks the full lyrical transtion \r\nto fantasy lyrics which had only been in a few Maiden songs up til that point. Bruce \r\nadds his Purple and VDGG influences to Steve's already strong songwriting to make \r\nsome of the best fantasy lyrics in power metal.<p>The album opens with \"Where Eagles Dare.\" Nicko wastes no time in announcing that he \r\nis the new Maiden drummer with the best performance ever heard on a Maiden song. \r\nLikewise, Bruce's performance is also his best. The song's chugging mid-tempo riff grabs \r\nyou from the start and refuses to let go.<p>\"Revelations\" continues Bruce's strong performances. Amazingly he sounds even better \r\nthan he did on Number of the Beast. It's very melodic and is another Boblical reference \r\n(remember the title track from NotB).<p>\"Flight of Icarus\" is the first of three straightforward rockers that comprise the middle \r\nof the album (think of Run to the Hills and NoTB from the last album, but ass on). This is \r\na vocal stunner, with Bruce hitting some very high notes. It brings the tempo of the \r\nalbum back up to a mid-level chug.<p>\"Die With Your Boots On\" is where the trademark gallop comes in. This is very \r\nstarightforward, but it's an addictive track with a catchy chorus.<p>\"The Trooper\" has Steve's best bassline, and it's one of his finest performances. The \r\nsong deals with a soldier (duh) who is mortally wounded in battle. This song is a Maiden \r\nclassic.<p>\"Still Life\" has a creepy intro complete with backwards speaking. The vocals are great, \r\nand this really varies the triple punch of the album's middle.<p>\"Quest For Fire\" and \"Sun and Steel\" are a little weak. They are straightforward but \r\nlack the punch of Die With Your Boots On and Flight of Icarus.<p>\"To Tame a Land\" is a great mini-epic closer that is very dark. The guitars here are the \r\nbest on the album, though not as good as the fretwork that would be on their next \r\nopus.<p>This album is almost as good as its successor Powerslave, though this album is more \r\nvaried than their magnum opus. This is Bruce Dickinson's album. His vocals here are a \r\ngood portion of his best work. His lyrical contributions have ensured that Piece of Mind \r\ncements the band within power metal. Nicko mcBrain is the next most significant \r\nmember; his inventive bass drums and cymbals making Maiden more progressive than it \r\never was. Maiden and metal fans must own this album along with everything Maiden \r\nhas made from the debut through 7th Son, then from Brave New World on. Proggies, \r\nhowever, will find this album too straightforward.<p>Grade: B</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106416#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106416\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=106416\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, January 7, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #106416)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1916\"><strong>King of Loss</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1916\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1916/Yes-close.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is one of the greatest bands of all time, the gods of Heavy Metal and maybe Prog? No, \r\nyou ask me about the Progness of the great gods of Metal, but really I must admit, this \r\nalbum is actually quite Progressive, but not yet to the point of great Progressive Metal like \r\nDream Theater, Pain of Salvation or even Opeth.<p>This album kicks off with the energetic song, Where Eagles Dare and catches you right into \r\nits catchy, intense Heavy metal riffs along with Bruce Dickinson's amazing presence. The \r\nalbum of course contains two of the most famous Maiden songs, being Flight of Icarus and \r\nthe Trooper being the more popular one. I must admit, these popular, catchy Iron Maiden \r\nsongs is what catchiness these days in popular music needs. The album intensifies at Still \r\nLife, one of my favorite Maiden songs of all time. Such a great tune and a fitting climax to \r\nthe album. <p>The album ends with Quest for Fire, Sun and Steel and to Lame a Land, all very good \r\nsongs, and had a huge helping hand in influencing many developing Power Metal bands. <p>This album might not be as progressive as some of Maiden's later albums, but this album is \r\na turning point in Maiden history due to the enormous turnaround in the band's sound and \r\nmaterial. This is a landmark nail in Maiden history and also one of their best albums, despite \r\nit being not Progressive.<p>This album is highly recommended for all fans of Metal and is a good addition for all music \r\nlisteners.<p>4- Metal listeners\r\n3- Prog Listeners</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126637#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126637\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=126637\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 24, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #126637)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI've finally heard this album enough times as to be ready to share my thoughts about it. \r\nEven though it was released after THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST, I review it now \r\nbecause I just got it a few days ago. <p> PIECE OF MIND marked the debut in Iron Maiden of now-legendary drummer Nicko \r\nMcBrain. He replaced Clive Burr who had to leave the band due to personal problems \r\n(later he would develop a physical illness, and Iron Maiden have proved their worth by \r\nhelping him in this hours of need). His style is quite similar, though I'd say McBrain's \r\ndrumming is even more precise, accurate, and more virtuosic. The trademark ride-\r\ncymbal rhythm that McBrain loves to do (when he actually follows the hits of the bass \r\ndrum) is incredibly simple but for me they bring a special flavor to the Beast's faster \r\ntracks (where it's usually used). The addition couldn't be more fortunate, as McBrain is \r\nreally the ideal drummer for the British metal machine. <p> The music itself is only slightly more developed than in the previous album, but at the \r\nsame time, it isn't. There are better textures and some interesting ideas, plus the \r\nrecording for sure sounds way better. But there aren't really great songs as \"Hallowed \r\nBe Thy Name\" was in the preceding record. There are a couple of really weak songs, \r\nsomething that actually represents a <em>decline</em> in quality from the not-brilliant but \r\nat least bad-songs-free NUMBER OF THE BEAST. <p> Where Eagles Dare (8.5/10) As if to say \"Hey, we have a new drummer\", the album \r\nkicks off with a drum intro by McBrain. What unfolds is a very enjoyable track that is \r\namong the classics from the band and that, surprisingly, wasn't one of the first singles \r\nfrom the album. From the start the drummer shows that he's no amateur, and this, his \r\nfirst appearance in a Maiden album, proves that he's precise, accurate, creative. The \r\nbass work is great, as is the guitars'. The instrumental section flies and flies above our \r\nheads, and the lyrics remind us of the film of the same name with Richard Burton and \r\nClint Eastwood where two ally spies got into a Nazi fortress high on top a hill. The solo \r\ntakes us to those heights, and the song succeeds. Surprise: another good opener for \r\nan Iron Maiden album.  <p> Revelations (8.5/10) This one starts slowly, as if carrying some extra weight, then it \r\ngets more melodic, even more pensive, and then the onslaught of energy comes. It \r\ndoesn't last long, as the melodic section arrives again. Good performance by Dickinson, \r\na good song, it may lack some hooks but it's powerful and heroic nevertheless. <p> Flight of Icarus (7/10) One of the singles of the album, I don't see why this is one of \r\nthe band's usual live songs. The chorus is certainly epic, but could be better. What IS \r\nepic is Harris' work, magnificent for such a slow-tempo song. This track doesn't deserve \r\nits fame, in my view, though that doesn't mean is bad. Is just not great. <p> Die With Your Boots On (5.5/10) As I said, this album has a couple weak tracks. This \r\none starts promising, with good energy and a good riff, but then the obnoxious chorus \r\nstrikes and ruins everything. And, to make matters worse, it appears and reappears \r\nagain and again. A simple heavy metal track in Judas Priest's vein, I don't like it at all. <p> The Trooper (9/10) What a change! The main riff, melody of this song is legendary \r\nstuff, the kind that surely makes every fan in a Maiden concert tremble and want to \r\nscream out loud along with The Beast. Sadly the song doesn't have a chorus that \r\nwould've make this a true anthem, (the song just has NO chorus at all) but the energy \r\nand the memorable opening make it the best in this record. <p> Still Life (7.5/10) This one starts softly, atmospherically, a conversation between all \r\nthe electric-string instruments. Dickinson joins the dialogue as an intruder but his great \r\nvocals make him a star in the debate. The song never gets anywhere, but it's \r\nenjoyable. Nothing amazing, though. Forgettable. <p> Quest for Fire (6/10) This very short song has a weird beginning where we expect \r\nsomething much faster and then we get a rather mid-tempo rhythm, with Dickinson \r\nhitting an awkward falsetto that just doesn't fit him that well. An average song, with no \r\ninteresting features, but nothing offensive neither. Mediocre.<p> Sun and Steel (6.5/10) An even shorter song, it starts with energy but no originality. \r\nThe chorus is just weak, sounds slightly cheesy. Another forgettable filler. The solo is \r\ngood enough to kick the rating up a notch. <p> To Tame a Land (6.5/10) The beginning is quiet, reminds us of the glories of \"Hallowed \r\nBe Thy Name\". The main verse isn't fantastic, the riff is not interesting. One of the few \r\nweak closers by The Beast, it leaves our minds just seconds after it got in. I expected a \r\ngreat short-epic conclusion, I got all that without the \"great\" part. Near the end, when \r\nit gets faster, some of the grace is saved, and we left the PIECE OF MIND experience \r\nwith somewhat of a mixed feeling, not knowing what to make out of the last uneven \r\ntrack. <p> All in all, a disappointing album, specially coming after such a classic as THE NUMBER \r\nOF THE BEAST. While that album wasn't perfect either, every song on it was at least \r\ndecent. Here we have a few advances towards progressiveness but also we take a few \r\nsteps back towards boredom. For sure, this and NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING are in a \r\nbattle to decide which one is my least favorite Maiden album. PIECE OF MIND wins, but \r\n<em>just by a hair.</em> And, to be more precise, because of <strong>a \"Trooper\". </strong><p> Recommended for: Hardcore fans of Maiden. Completionists. And also to non-fans who \r\nwant to have Maiden's best songs and can't get a hold of a Greatest Hits with \"The \r\nTrooper\" on it.<p>.there would not be any peace of mind without that song in your collection, that \r\nwouldn't be a true feast of the Beast. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126954#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126954\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=126954\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 27, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #126954)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nA solid metal album progressing on the framework created by \"Number of the Beast\", this one features more experimentation in song \r\nstructure as well as varying tempos and moods, the final result being one of Maiden's most celebrated works.

Although clearly the spiritual successor to the more interesting \"Number of the Beast\", \"Piece of Mind\" holds its own because of its sheer enthusiasm and energy.

The album \r\nsees the band attempting to add greater development to their songs, thus taking them beyond mere heavy rock. <p>The familiar aggression is still there of course, Steve Harris combining with new drummer Nicko McBrain to provide the long lasting \r\npowerhouse rhythm section. After the typical all guns blazing start with \"Where eagles dare\", \"Revelations\" has a surprisingly \r\nWishbone Ash like feel. The twin lead guitars and slightly slower but variable pace combine to make for a highly satisfactory prog \r\ninfluenced number. <p>\"Flight of Icarus\" is clearly more commercially orientated, the massed vocal chorus being designed to form an anthem for the masses \r\nto join in with. \"Die with your boots on\" is the weakest of the bunch here, being a very ordinary single paced piece of rock metal with \r\nbanal lyrics - <I>If you're gonna die, die with your boots on. If you're gonna die just stick around. Gonna cry, just move along, if \r\nyou're gonna die, you're gonna die.</I>.<p>\"The trooper\" continues the theme of death on the battlefield in an upbeat frenzy. Just another unremarkable Iron Maiden song \r\nreally. \"Still life\" misleadingly sets out as a soft number, opening with backward spoken vocals then harmonised lead and acoustic \r\nguitars combining effectively. Soon however we are into more orthodox Maiden territory, the track leading off a trio of shorter IM \r\nstandards.<p>The closing \"To tame a land\" was inspired by the \"Dune\" novels. It is similar in structure to \"Revelations\", being a slightly more \r\ncomplex, but nonetheless totally identifiable metallic rock tale.<p>In all, a good album which will satisfy the Iron Maiden faithful. The album contains a couple of well arranged and performed longer \r\npieces which make it a worthwhile acquisition. There are however a number of disappointingly prosaic songs which appear to have \r\nbeen churned out in by the numbers fashion. <p>Derek Riggs superb sleeve illustration once again makes the clear case for LP sleeves over CD booklets.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=133340#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=133340\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=133340\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, August 16, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #133340)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11631\"><strong>Windhawk</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11631\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11631/lpvet2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden is a heavy metal band hailing from England, that has become a household name for anyone with a slight interest in\r\nhard rock and heavy metal during the 27 years they have released music so far. Piece of Mind was their fourth studio album,\r\nreleased back in 1983.<p>Many fans, especially their older fans, think this album is the high point of the bands career. Which is understandable, for\r\nmany reasons. Piece of Mind was the first studio release with what by most is seen as the classic Iron Maiden line-up;\r\nDickinson-Murray-Smith-Harris-McBrain. On this album they take a final goodbye to the more obvious musical influences from\r\nthe past; and for the most part have a very strong personal identity stamped to the music made.<p>And although the band seek out some calmer and mellow moods on this album, the music is clearly heavy metal from start to\r\nfinish. Examples of the progressive leanings they would explore further on later releases can be found; especially on second\r\ntrack \"Revelations\"; but most of all this is a heavy metal album high on melody, a good balance between riffs, riff pattens\r\nand drawn out guitar chords to form melodies; some really nice harmonic and melodic guitar soloing, and at times beautiful\r\nand imaginative underscoring of the melody line from Steve Harris on the bass guitar. With excellent rhythms courtesy of\r\nNicko on the drums, and mostly good vocals from Dickinson. <p>The songs are a mixed affair on this release though. The band seems to have decided what direction to follow at this time,\r\nbut still seem to be exploring how to best utilize their musicianship in this style. Some really cheesy choruses are to be\r\nfound here too; that probably sounded much better in 1983 than they do in 2007. There's quite a few goodies on this release\r\nthough; and for many \"The Trooper\" is the absolute highlight on this release; a track combining the best parts of the sound\r\nIron Maiden pursued before 1983 with some of the best parts the band would pursue after 1983.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=149305#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=149305\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=149305\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, November 6, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #149305)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI would lie to you if I told you that this Maiden album is drastically different from the previous ones. From a pure hard-rock debut, \r\nthe evolution towards almost full heavy metal is now finalized. <p>There will also be some attempts to develop more elaborate songs as if the \"Purple\" shadow was still hanging above their heads. But \r\nthese are not truly convincing. Neither \"Where Eagles Dare\", nor \"Revelations\".<p>While \"Killers\" was a bomb from start to finish, this album is slower paced. More AOR-oriented which is not necessary a good \r\nnews. \"Flight of Icarus\" is one example and is only saved by a great guitar break. One of my fave is the fully hard-rocking \"Die With \r\nYour Boots On\". Energetic, aggressive and powerful. Traditional Maiden. Finally.<p>This album won't feature lots of great stuff. The band has released much better than this album. IMO, it is their weakest effort so \r\nfar. These crazy beats are almost forgotten, few great guitar breaks (like in \"Still Life\" - well named!). I guess that Maiden maniacs \r\nare still pleased with this delivery but I can't be too laudatory about it.<p>Still, \"Quest Of Fire\" or \"Sun & Steel\" are more in accordance with my Maiden expectations (especially the latter which takes up again \r\nwith their wildest rock music). Last numbers are stronger (a casting mistake maybe). The closing (and longest) being the best one \r\nIMO.<p>But it is not enough to make this album unforgettable. Just a good heavy metal one. Deserving an average rating of five out of ten \r\non my rating scale.<p>Oh yes, I was about to forget. One advice for progheads maybe : stay away of this album, since you would hardly find ten seconds \r\nof whatever progressive music you could think of.<p>Three stars.<p><p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=152528#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=152528\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=152528\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, November 24, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #152528)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nPiece of Mind is the fourth album from Iron Maiden, and it is often \r\nforgotten as it is placed between two very essential albums in Iron \r\nMaiden\u00b4s discography namely The Number of the Beast and Powerslave. \r\nPiece of Mind is not to be forgotten though as there are many great \r\nsongs on the album. It\u00b4s the album where Bruce Dickinson began to \r\nput his mark on the songs and he even contributed to the song \r\nwriting here too. This is also the first album with new drummer \r\nNicko McBrain who has replaced Clive Burr.<p>The album starts with the powerful Where Eagles Dare where Bruce Dickinson sings in the very high \r\nend of his considerable register. The man is just a fantastic singer. It\u00b4s a very good opener and an \r\nenjoyable song. Revelations which is a song written by Bruce Dickinson follows and it\u00b4s a very beautiful \r\nyet at times heavy song. I must admit I prefer the live version from the Live After Death album which \r\nis a bit faster paced but the original version on Piece of Mind is also very good. Then comes Flight of \r\nIcarus which is a very melodic and majestic song. It\u00b4s another classic Iron Maiden song. Side 1 of the \r\noriginal LP ends with Die With Your Boots On. Even though this is considered an Iron Maiden classic I \r\nhave always found it below standard, and it\u00b4s the song on Piece of Mind I like the least. The only thing \r\nI enjoy about Die With Your Boots On is the beautiful guitar solo.<p>Side 2 of the original LP starts with one of the ultimate Iron Maiden classics in The Trooper, fast paced \r\nand melodic riffing drives this song forward. Bruce sounds very inspired here. The Trooper is definitely \r\none of the highlights on Piece of Mind. Still Life is another favorite of mine. It\u00b4s kind of a different \r\nsounding Iron Maiden song and maybe that\u00b4s what I like about it. It certainly helps the variation on the \r\nalbum. It\u00b4s a very melodic song and it has some great guitar solos. Quest for Fire is a mid tempo song \r\nwhich I never thought was anything special. It\u00b4s allright though. I appreciate Sun and Steel just a notch \r\nmore, but it\u00b4s definitely not the best song here either. The last song saves the last star for Piece of \r\nMind as I have always loved the epic To Tame a Land. It\u00b4s another favorite of mine. It\u00b4s a very \r\nmelodic and majestic song with lots of double lead guitar action and solos. I think it\u00b4s on par with other \r\nepic Iron Maiden songs like Hallowed By Thy Name, Alexander The Great and Rime of the Ancient \r\nMariner.<p>I have only positive things to say about Iron Maiden as musicians. They are all very well playing and \r\ntheir compositional skills are very high too.<p>The production is not the best Iron Maiden production, and I prefer both The Number of the Beast and \r\nPowerslaves\u00b4s productions to this one, but it\u00b4s allright and of course much better than anyone else \r\ncould conjure up in heavy metal in 1983.<p>To sum up this is an excellent album filled with classic Iron Maiden songs. There are a few weak \r\nmoments on Piece of Mind, but generally it\u00b4s an excellent album. I wouldn\u00b4t call it progressive even \r\nthough songs like Revelations and To Tame a Land does have progressive tendencies. That doesn\u00b4t \r\nmake it a bad album though and I will rate it 4 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=168397#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=168397\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=168397\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, April 22, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #168397)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10022\"><strong>The Whistler</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10022\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10022/J-Tull_Christmas--again--small.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn a time when 2.5 ruled the earth...<p>See! See! I TOLD you this was going to happen! What the crap is this? I'll tell you what this is! This is \r\ndull, dull, eighties radio metal! In their attempt to keep putting out unstoppable metal albums, Iron \r\nMaiden has stripped away all their uniqueness that made me fall in love with the band, and reduced \r\nthemselves to a third rate heavy metal band.<p>Piece of Mind is not quite the career low I make it out to be, but it's just such a disappointment. A \r\ndisappointment I could see coming a million miles away, but a disappointment nonetheless. <p>\"Where Eagles Dare\" is a fairly lifeless piece of radio metal. Toe-tappin' fer sure, but it lacks the \r\nmemorability and energy of all other Maiden openers thus far, and about halfway through, I loose \r\ninterest. \"Revelations\" tries to fool you with a moody intro, but it's not much better. It speeds up a little \r\ntowards the middle, which is cool, but hardly enough to save it. <p>\"Flight of Icarus\" at least sounds a little more like the band wants to play it, but as soon as that picks \r\nup, Dickinson starts to remind me why I think he's an irritating little Dio-wannabe. But, hey, at least it's \r\nshort and headbangin', and that's all I can ask for at this point. <p>\"Die With Your Boots On\" is also a little more energy laden, but it's also fairly mindless with the warfare \r\nimagery (seriously, what's up with the screwy vocals?). Especially when it's paired up with \"The \r\nTrooper,\" the album's best, and only classic number. A great galloping bassline and artillery mimicking \r\npercussion frames a truly headbanging look at the Charge of the Light Brigade. Only from Iron Maiden; \r\ntoo bad they can't keep it up. <p>Backwards \"hidden\" vocals certainly can't save \"Still Life,\" which tries to go all moody and powerful, but \r\njust ends up sounding like a bad Number of the Beast outtake. At least here I can tell that they're really \r\ntrying to be intelligent and tricky (it's not H.P. Lovecraft related, is it?), but c'mon! It's just not very \r\ngood is all. <p>Now, \"Quest For Fire\" is just plain fun, since the strong opening riffage is immediately followed by the \r\nline: \"In a time when dinosaurs ruled the earth!\" Oh yeah. It's THAT good. Sadly, any cool music that \r\ncould come from the song (and it's one of the more decent offerings) is swamped by the subject \r\nmatter. \"Sun and Steel\" is slightly less embarrassing, and a solid, if not terribly original sounding, \r\nDungeons and Dinosaurs metallic offering (it's about swords!). <p>Ah, but we've saved the least for last. \"To Tame a Land\" is the most pointless Iron Maiden epic to date. \r\nThe moody intro is actually effective, but it quickly dissolves into unimaginative Arabic riffage that just \r\nponders on and on and on over its seven minutes without ever actually really doing anything. C'mon \r\nguys! I could write a better epic about sand worms in five minutes...<p>So the basic problem with Piece is that, when the Maiden try to create something purely headbangin', it \r\ncomes out cheap. All the \"lesser\" material on the album is something that any number of bands, from \r\nwhich I expect far less, could produce. And they'd probably do it better too. Aha! But when they try and \r\ndo something intelligent and recapture their earlier glory, they fall flat on their faces (is it any wonder \r\nthan Frank Herbert didn't let 'em actually name \"Too Lame a Land\" after one of the Dune novels?).<p>I mean, of course the classic Maiden sound is here, which is most of why I give it so \"high\" a rating. \r\nEverything thumps along with the standard \"Maiden formula,\" so I don't mind the noise that's coming \r\nout of my stereo, I just wish it had been...you know, attached to tricky solos, or cool lyrics, or...crap, \r\nhow about a memorable riff here or there, huh? Would that kill you? <p>Perhaps it would. Most of the time, it sounds like only Dickinson is keeping faith in the band, and \r\nsometimes, even HE sounds as lifeless as the rest of the musicians. Luckily enough though, Steve \r\nHarris was a smart enough lad that he able to use this dreadful album as a springboard to catapult him \r\nto Powerslave. I mean, can't you hear the start of \"Powerslave\" in \"To Tame a Land,\" and \"Two Minutes \r\nto Midnight\" in \"Die With Your Boots On?\" Surely I don't have to point out \"Where Eagles Dare\" \r\nand \"Aces High\"...<p>How Steve-o was able to pull a minor metal masterpiece like Slave out of this Piece of Crap is beyond \r\nme, but just be glad he did. Skip over this one, download \"The Trooper\" and go right to Slave, for your \r\nown good. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176261#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176261\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=176261\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 7, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #176261)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>Piece of Mind</em></strong> continues some of the commercial metal tendencies of the preceding\r\n<em>Number of The Beast</em> but this time Maiden was blessed by a thundering blast of inspiration,\r\nenergy and ambition.<p>The opening <em>Where Eagles Dare</em> is one of the best tracks they've ever written and displays a\r\nstunning musical growth and maturity. This is their first song that goes beyond competent hard-rock\r\nand explores the proggy aspects of earlier masters like Rainbow and Judas Priest. Everything Maiden\r\ndoes here had been done before them but they pull it off well enough. Also <em>Revelations</em> is a\r\nvery powerful and accomplished piece. Plenty of references to Rush here, the quote from\r\n<em>Anthem</em> at minute 4 being the most obvious.<p>The following three tracks, <em>Flight of The Icarus</em>, <em>Die With Your Boots On</em> and <em>The\r\nTrooper</em> are catchy and commercial but have that typical Maiden style with those galloping\r\nrhythms. With <em>Still Life</em>, Maiden launches into 3 other songs that are less appealing,\r\nfeaturing their trademark riffing but rather predictable anthemic choruses that lack the inspiration\r\nof the previous batch of songs. The album ends in great style with the superb <em>To Tame A Land</em>.<p><em>Piece of mind</em> is not entirely consistent but the 2 opening tracks and the album closer\r\nbalance out the run of the mill material in the second half.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260306#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260306\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=260306\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, January 11, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #260306)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden - Piece of Mind (1984)<p>By now Iron Maiden had become one of the biggest metal-acts of the globe and expectations \r\nwere high for the fourth release. Iron Maiden changed their style a bit by excluding the rock'n \r\nroll/punk of the Paul Di'Anno era. Also Nicko McBrain enters the band, giving Iron Maiden some \r\nnew grounds to explore. The band originally named the album 'Dune', but they didn't get the \r\nrights to do so. <p>Where Eagles Dare is an interesting track with great drums of McBrain and atmospheric guitar \r\nparts. Still this track isn't as convincing as other Iron Maiden opening tracks. Revelations is \r\nhowever one of my favorite track ever. The track was written by Bruce Dickinson and has a very \r\nun-orthodox form. There are many instrumental and vocal parts and a lot of extrovert vocals by \r\nDickinson. The clean-guitar with melodic bass-line part in the middle and ending of the song is \r\nmemorable. Love this one! Flight of Icarus had been released as a single, but turns out to be a \r\ngreat Iron Maiden song. The guitar solo's on the end are great! Die With Your Boots On is great \r\nmetal-track, but not as appealing as others. The Trooper needs little introduction: It's an Iron \r\nMaiden anthem with great instrumental parts (and a perfect two-part guitar solo in the middle!) \r\nand aggressive vocals by Bruce. Still Life is even better with it's nice atmospheric and \r\nfearsome vocals and melodics parts. Quest for Fire and Sun and Steel are two less inventive \r\ntracks and the reason some discard this album. The songs are fun, but just not as good as \r\nother songs. To Tame A Land is however one of the best Iron Maiden epics with perfect \r\ninstrumental parts and inventive songwriting. The bass is very good on this song. <p>Conclusion. This album has some of Iron Maiden's best songs and some mediocre tracks. \r\nStill it is a very good album for fans but perhaps less interesting for others. I will give it three \r\nstars, but my personal opinion of the album is higher. Essential for fans, interesting for metal \r\nfans and perhaps a good addition for others. For those who embrace the digital era I \r\nrecommend to listen to To Tame A Land, Revelations, Still Life and The Trooper.<p>* I've listened to this album some more, and I must say it is worth at least four stars. There are to many favorite Maiden tracks on this one. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284300#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284300\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284300\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 31, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284300)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe followup to the \"Number of the Beast\" is a lacklustre effort with some shining moments, \r\nbut a whole bunch of forgettable tracks that nobody cares about anymore. However this album \r\ndoes have the excellent 'Flight of Icarus' that is perhaps one of the all time great metal tracks of \r\nthe 80s. The film clip was wonderful eye candy and you can never forget that awesome chorus, \r\nor the riff that drives it. <p>Back in the 80s I remember seeing many IM posters of songs from this album primarily 'The \r\nTrooper' with Eddie looking very paramilitary. Also 'Where Eagles Dare' and 'Die With Your \r\nBoots' had the same anti-war thematic content; a theme that IM would continue on subsequent \r\nalbums including the more recent \"A Matter of Life and Death\". <p>'Revelations' has the same themes as 'Number of the Beast' that began with a reading from \r\nRevelation in the Bible. <p>'To Tame a Land' is a lengthy track with memorable riffs and a brilliant lead break from Smith \r\nand Murray with Harris's bass driving it along. The track was covered recently by Dream \r\nTheater and sounds as relevant today as in the early 80s.

Released just a year after\r\n<em>The Number of the Beast</em>, Iron Maiden had already changed significantly by this point. First\r\nof all, on this album Bruce Dickinson's creative influence begins to really shine through. He\r\nco-wrote many of the tracks on <em>Piece of Mind</em>, and even wrote one of the songs with no help\r\nfrom the other bandmates. He's a fantastic songwriter, and it's great to hear that he's leaving his\r\nmark on Iron Maiden's music. Secondly, this is the debut of now-legendary drummer Nicko McBrain.\r\nClive Burr is a great drummer and I have an infinite respect for him, but Nicko McBrain is simply\r\none of the best heavy metal drummers out there. He really is a key part of Iron Maiden, and a\r\ncomplete monster behind the drumkit as well.<p>The sound here is unmistakably Iron Maiden. Although there have been some changes in Iron Maiden\r\nsince <em>The Number of the Beast</em>, their sound is generally the same. Of course, judging by the\r\nimmense critical and commercial success of their previous masterwork, that's definitely not a\r\nproblem. <em>Piece of Mind</em> shows Iron Maiden incorporating a few more prog influences into their\r\nsound, but that wouldn't happen completely until <em>Powerslave</em>. <p><em>Piece of Mind</em> is a 9-track, 44:38 album. All of the songs here are pretty great except for\r\nmaybe <em>Still Life</em>, which is decent. <em>Die With Your Boots On</em> and <em>Sun and Steel</em> are\r\nfar from Iron Maiden's best, but they're still decent tracks. This is one of Iron Maiden's more\r\ninconsistent albums, but highlights like <em>Where Eagles Dare</em>, <em>Revelations</em>, <em>The\r\nTrooper</em>, and <em>To Tame a Land</em> make <em>Piece of Mind</em> an essential Maiden album. <p>Like most Iron Maiden albums, the musicianship is possibly the best part about the music. They are\r\nan exceptionally tight-playing group of virtuoso musicians, and <em>Piece of Mind</em> was when they\r\nreally began showing this. On this album they acquired one of the best heavy metal drummers out\r\nthere (Nicko McBrain), in addition to already having some of the best musicians in metal.<p>The production quality on <em>Piece of Mind</em> is great. I love the organic sound, yet dynamic\r\nenough to display Iron Maiden's powerful music. This isn't quite as good as <em>Powerslave</em>\r\nproduction-wise, but it's still definitely among the better heavy metal productions. By 1983 many\r\nbands were using \"that terrible 80's sound\", but Iron Maiden, thankfully, were never one of them.<p><B>Conclusion:</B><p><em>Piece of Mind</em> is yet another great album by Iron Maiden, and even though it's not quite as\r\ngood as <em>The Number of the Beast</em>, it deserves the 4 star rating just as much. It's really a\r\nshame that many people overlook this album since it's between two seminal albums (<em>The Number of\r\nthe Beast</em> and <em>Powerslave</em>), because it really is just as good as those releases. Highly\r\nrecommended to all NWoBHM fans.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=294373#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=294373\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=294373\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, August 13, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #294373)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nPart two of the so called Iron Maiden album trilogy, <em>Piece Of Mind</em> is another album filled with familiar hits like <em>Where Eagles Dare</em>, <em>Flight Of Icarus</em> and <em>The Trooper</em>, but is it really all that the fans make it out to be? Let's dive in and see!<p>\r\nThe biggest change, this time around, is the fact that the band have managed to fully utilize Bruce Dickinson's vocal style and use it to their advantage on each of these nine tracks. This is also the first of the many album's featuring Nicko McBrain on drums, thus completing the classic Iron Maiden lineup that would last for the remainder of the decade. Things just couldn't be any better... too bad that I don't share the same perception of this album.<p>\r\nThe best way to summarize this record is by calling it Iron Maiden playing it safe. The band literally never leaves their comfort zone throughout this entire album. Everything is just so cozy and annoyingly predictable that I honestly get bored while listening to the material. Why call an album something as thought provoking as <em>Piece Of Mind</em> when it's everything but that! The only track that actually has the potential of breaking outside the generic formula is the Dune-inspired mini epic <em>To Tame A Land</em>, but even this composition manages to waste a lot of it's expanded 7+ minute time frame by stomping on the same old ground as always. Let's just say that <em>Rime Of The Ancient Mariner</em> it is not.<p>\r\nI really don't feel like wasting too much time on describing this release since the fans are already well familiar with it's contents while everyone else could do much better by picking up the two Paul Di'Anno-era albums or the two albums that proceeded <em>Piece Of Mind</em>. Yes, Steve Harris does another outstanding job and the Murray/Smith dual guitar action is getting tighter by the minute, but what is it all for when the material is so thin and uninspired?

The first is that it's more of the same - rather than representing a \r\nsudden and impressive development of the band's sound, as the earlier album did, the album \r\nsimply showcases the band continuing to make the most of Bruce's impressive vocal abilities \r\nand developing their prog-influenced song structures. The other reason is that whilst there's \r\nplenty of great songs here, there isn't a standout hit quite on the level of the title track from \r\nNumber of the Beast.<p>But these are mild quibbles at best; the fact is, with tracks like To Tame A Land, Where Eagles \r\nDare, Flight of Icarus and Die With Your Boots On, this is another key Maiden album which \r\nproved that their new musical direction was not exhausted yet.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=574798#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=574798\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=574798\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, November 25, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #574798)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nClive Burr left due to personal issues and ended up trading places with Nicko McBrain in the band\r\nTrust.

The recording is actually a backwards rendition of\r\nNicko McBrain uttering \"What ho said the t'ing with the three 'bonce', do not meddle with things you\r\ndon't understand...\", followed by a belch.<p>This is one of my all time favorite albums. The album is absolutely phenomenal in how it flows from\r\none track to the other keeping it varied, keeping it intense and stimulating not only your\r\nheadbanging needs but also your intellectual appreciation for well-crafted lyrics.

They would also become, by far, the hardest working band in the world. \r\nJust look at the tour schedules from the late '80s.  There's a reason Iron Maiden got so big. <p>The lyrics are also improved, with less death, rape and mayhem, and more adventure, myth and\r\nwarfare.   A salute to the fearless British fliers of WW II is a vengeful opener in triplet with\r\nIM's signature dual guitar harms and Dickinson pulling highs not human in nature.  Greek drama\r\n'Flight of Icarus' and sacrificial 'Die with Your Boots On' could've been expanded upon but it's\r\nback to business for 'The Trooper' with this lineup at their best, and equally good 'Still Life'\r\nreminding of the first two albums.  No stride broken in 'Quest for Fire', its Cimmerian imagery and\r\nCeltic jigs, the band peaking here with probably the best thing on the album, followed by\r\nSaxon-esque and very nice 'Sun and Steel' and totally killer prog number 'To Tame a Land'.<p>Like a trusted old friend who always brings the goods, Maiden was there with quality heavy music\r\nthat didn't recognize the climate at a time when most metal bands were finished or too embarrassing\r\nto acknowledge.

In my \r\nopinion, this was not the album to show the incredible talent that was to come or what came before, and stands  as \r\nmy least favourite classic Iron Maiden album.  While certain aspects were improved, such as having a grittier, \r\nheavier production and a few songs that were more involved, the overall consistency of the album is much lower, \r\nhaving some genuinely bad songs mixed in with the gems. <p>\r\nWhere Eagles Dare starts off the album in a way that shows what to come, a mixed bag. I feel that this song goes on \r\nfor too long without enough variation, the drumming is high energy and incredibly good, and the rest of the \r\ninstrumentation is just as high quality. Another issue I have outside the fairly repetitive nature of the song is that \r\nthe vocals sound unusually washed out. Revelations puts the album on track directly afterwards however, filled \r\nwith amazing riffs, great vocal melodies, and a lot of power all put into this slower paced song. The interplay \r\nbetween the main guitar riff and the bass is definitely my favourite touch in this song however, sure, the rest is \r\ngreat, being varied and highly emotional, but this little detail right here is really what pushes the song even higher, \r\nshowing amazing intricacy in everything played. If it weren't for The Trooper, Flight Of Icarus would likely be my \r\nfavouirte single the band had put out during their classic era, the mid paced galloping riff and the absolutely \r\nmajestic vocals of Bruce, complete with the perfection of the chorus and an awesome lyrical subject matter. The \r\nTrooper mamages to be an even better single however, containing may of these elements, but being much faster \r\nand more anthemic. While usually being one to feel indifferent to the \"woaaaahh\" type vocals, it works incredibly \r\nwell here, and is definitely what brings the song together. Another major highlight is the closing track To Tame A \r\nLand, just like with Hallowed Be Thy Name it contains a more proggy structure, the closest thing to a chorus or hook \r\nbeing the guitar riff played after every few lines. The song has a strong middle eastern tinge to it and some good \r\nideas that bleed through, definitely a decent closer, even if it doesn't match up to the perfection of Hallowed Be Thy \r\nName. <p>\r\nIf the album had songs on this level all the way through, then it'd be easily one of Maiden's better albums, but while \r\nDie With Your Boots On is pretty decent, Still Life, Quest For Fire and Sun and Steel are all quite poor and make it \r\nincredibly hard to enjoy this album holistically. Still Life's problem all comes down to being incredibly dull to me, \r\nstarting off in an interesing and eerie way, before devolving into mediocrity and underwhelming hooks. Quest For \r\nFire is even worse, which is expected when the opening lyrical line is \"In a land where dinosaurs walked the earth\" \r\nwhile singing about cavemen... yeah. It doesn't help that the vocal delivery here is so absurdly operatic that it \r\ncrosses into being utterly hilarious, like, I find it impossible to not laugh at this song, doesn't help that it's generally \r\na pretty awful song anyway, being so painfully cheesy. Sun And Steel is better than Quest For Fire, but is just a very \r\nbarebones, rudimentary metal song, and I find it to be quite lacking in charm and character. <p>\r\nWIth a bit of reworking, this album could have been something amazing, it's just unforutnate that there are songs \r\nlike Quest For Fire and Still Life mixed in with Revelations and The Trooper. While this album contains a strong set \r\nof highlights just like Powerslave, it also has the same issue as it in terms of missing the mark in quite a number of \r\ntracks, difference being that the highlights here aren't quite as strong for the most part, and the low points are far \r\nlower. Iron Maiden's classic period post Number Of The Beast displayed a gradual progression into absolute \r\ngreatness, and as the starting point of this progression, it's clear that there'd be some issues with the album for \r\nsure, still an enjoyable listen, but not even close to my first pick when it comes to this amazing band. <p>\r\nBest songs: Revelations, Flight of Icarus, The Trooper <p>\r\nWeakest songs: Quest for Fire, Still Life, Sun and Steel <p>\r\nVerdict: Not a bad album by any means, containing a number of amazing metal tracks, but unfortunately also \r\ncontains some really low quality songs, making this an enjoyable, but ultimately flawed and inconsistent listen.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2236326#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2236326\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2236326\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, July 9, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12929#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2236326)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter 1982's 'The Number of the Beast' cemented Iron Maiden's prominence in the metal world, the band were quickly \r\nback in the studio to build upon their momentum with 'Piece of Mind', an album that many fans hold in high regard, \r\nbut one that I merely consider the final step in the transitional \r\n...
