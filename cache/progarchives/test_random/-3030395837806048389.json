It's also cool to see who works on what cd and what project\r\nbecause at this point the line-up for these albums are starting to look like the family tree in a\r\nLouisiana swamp, small and interconnected. Jonas Reingold has appeared as the bass player for\r\nseveral bands such as <I>Kaipa</I>, <I>Midnight Sun</I> and <I>Tomas Bodin</I>, he's also produced a\r\nnumber of offerings for bands. He's best known for work on his own solo project, but also as a\r\nmain-stay with <I>The Flower Kings</I> and <I>The Tangent</I>. This guy certainly is busy, but that\r\nhasnt stopped him from outputting this excellent opus. The line-up for the album makes one grin as\r\nit's pretty clear that Reingold has a lot of people who owe him favors. Along for the ride with\r\nReingold are Zoltan Csorsz (<I>The Flower Kings</I>, <I>The Tangent</I>) on drums and jazz master\r\nKrister Jonsson (<I>The Tangent</I>, solo) on guitar. Guesting on the album are a few more familiar\r\nfaces such as Andy Tillison (<I>The Tangent</I>, <I>Parallel or 90 Degrees</I>) on the organ and\r\nhammond, Tomas Bodin on keyboards and Theo Travis (<I>The Tangent</I>, <I>No-Man</I>, <I>Travis and\r\nFripp</I>, <I>Theo Travis Band</I>). Quite frankly, a perfect line-up for this kind of album. <p>Karmakanic's third album, <I>Who's The Boss In The Factory</I>, is a lot of what you can expect from\r\nthese guys based on their previous works. So fans of the avant fans can flee for cover and those who\r\nlove ''retro'' old-school progressive rock should step right up for this album. With only 6 tracks\r\nit's pretty evident that this bass player was going for the grandiose feeling rather than the\r\nconcise, and he seems to have pulled it off rather well. Here we get exactly what people want to\r\nhear from this kind of band, we have the 20-minute sprawling epic, the 13-minute powerhouse, a\r\nshorter rocker, a 10-minute mini epic and an emotional conclusion to the album.<p>A lot of people are likely already drawing parallels to <I>The Flower Kings</I> [TFK] just upon\r\nhearing the description of the album. Well, there are a lot of parallels, but these are two\r\ncompletely separate entities. While Jonas plays a more loose and jazzy bass on TFK's efforts he's\r\nswitched to a harder-rocking sound for this album. While TFK is more of a light-hearted group with\r\nupbeat songs, Karmakanic is a little bit more cynical in the long run of things. Reingold says he\r\nmade the album with the intent to make people feel good, something definitely archived by the\r\nopening epic, <B>Send A Message From The Heart</B>, which has all the upbeateties you could ever\r\nhope to find in a song. Soaring keyboard solos and a nicely uplifting voice from G\u00f6ran Edman make\r\nfor a very pleasant tune. The rest of the album, however, starts to get a little cynical. The\r\nexcellent rocker, <B>Let In Hollywood</B>, is lead by a powerful bass and synth riff and makes for a\r\ngood chorus when it rolls around. This makes for a nice break between the epics, as the lengthy\r\ntitle track is short to follow. This one is a lot slower and more evil sounding with it's chants and\r\nsynths pressing in an almost industrial fashion. <B>Two Blocks From The Edge</B> is another more\r\nevil sounding song thanks to Theo Travis's wonderful sax work and the generally malevolent\r\natmosphere provided by the keyboards and hammonds.<p>Of course the final two songs really deserve credit. <B>Eternally (Part I and II)</B> may feel\r\nslightly out of place as these are much more 'sad' songs than the rest, but that can be expected\r\nbeing that Reingold wrote these songs for his parents who tragically passed away late last year. The\r\nemotion can be felt right off the top of the first section as <B>Part I</B> is a short but delicate\r\npiano piece and <B>Part II</B> is filled with grand string sections and an emotional voice. The\r\nsongs combine to make for a very moving piece, and Reingold really pulled it off well.<p>Great and somewhat dark symphonic prog from a great group of musicians. Fans of any of the bands mentioned above should definitely seek to acquire this record, you won't be disappointed. People who feel that TFK albums go on for too long or have too much ''filler'' should also seek solace in this record, since there's nothing on the album that could be considered as such. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that with this release the alumni of the various bands that the musicians come from have given their other bands a run for their money. 4 stars out of 5! A great effort.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=187508#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=187508\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=187508\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, October 31, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #187508)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15928\"><strong>progrules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15928\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15928/cover_1325619920091.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe not yet very long discography of Karmakanic shows an impressive improvement with each next \r\nrelease. And if the score for this album so far is not deceiving, you can't go wrong with this one. At this \r\nmoment it's 4,57 from 15 ratings, that's promising at least. And I already have the two predecessors so I \r\nknow what this band is about and what they are capable of. I have every confidence of having bought a \r\nwinner here.<p>And so it proved to be I can already reveal. First song starts somewhat strange with a sweet singing little \r\nkid leaving you puzzled what it's all about. No worries, it only lasts a few seconds and after that it's \r\nentering paradise with an absolute masterpiece track called Send a Message from the Heart, a true epic in \r\nthe style of Flower Kings. (I could swear I hear Roine Stolt sing and play the guitar here and there on this \r\nalbum but the booklet says he is only playing the guitar on one of the songs (Two Blocks) so I'm partly \r\nright and partly wrong here.) And I also would have put money on the guess he did some of the \r\nsongwriting for this album. Wrong too, it's all Jonas' work (except the lyrics By Inge Ohlen R.). Well, both \r\nJonas and Roine are in TFK so it's not really strange to make such a mistake. But with TFK 90% of the \r\nsongs are from Roine so that's why I'm still a bit surprised. Especially this first song is so much like TFK, \r\nthere is also lots of the sound of their previous album detectable and this can only mean it's excellent. \r\nMore than excellent because Send a message ..  can compete with the very best epics by TFK. So this is \r\nobvious 5* material. Also a lot better than the best songs by this band so far and I was already \r\nenthusiastic with mainly the second album, so...<p>Next up is the shorter Let in Hollywood, a song to wipe the sweat from your forehead and stop shaking. \r\nAlthough, not quite true, this one is less uplifting but still a very good track, lasting appr. 5 minutes, some \r\nheavy music with this one, a bit like Rush but better (4,25*).<p>After this the next masterpiece, the title track, starting quietly with piano and some darkish singing by the \r\nexcellent vocalist, Goran Edman. After some 2,5 minutes a very recognizable chorus sets in played in \r\ntypical Karmakanic style. This proves that Karmakanic is not a TFK clone, if it seemed like that by my \r\ncomment in the first epic, I take that back. There are resemblances indeed but Karmakanic has still it's \r\nown sound and it's more present in this track than in the first one. \r\nAfter this vocal part, it's instrumental time and boy, do these guys know how to play them ! Bass, piano \r\nand lead guitar, it's all mindblowing stuff combined in a terrific composition. After about the 5th listening \r\nI'm absolutely convinced, this album has to be a masterpiece in my book and this song is partly \r\nresponable for that (4,75*).<p>And it's almost as if the band must have thought: for those (fools) who still have doubts about the \r\nmasterpiece status, we'll throw in another superb track. This one is called Two Blocks from the Edge and is \r\nprobably the very best from the 3 crackers of this album. Again I get the feeling Roine is doing the singing \r\nin the beginning but it's Goran actually, I think they only sound the same when Goran sings softly. After \r\n1,5 minutes you can hear this clearly. On this song Theo Travis does the saxophone in an excellent \r\ncontribution. His bandmate from The Tangent Andy Tilison is also present in this Perfect Party I would like \r\nto call this album. Two of the best progmusicians around, so in fact it's not a surprise at all that this has \r\nbecome a mindblowing effort of an album. Huge guitarplaying by Krister Jonsson has also got to be \r\nmentioned. The climax of this track is reminiscent of Monsters & Men by TFK, more or less my most \r\nfavourite song ever. Not strange that I can only give this 5 (6,7,8,etc) stars. Incredible stuff.<p>I'm running out of superlatives here, can't help it. This album is so 100% my cup of tea, even more than \r\nTFK and I never thought that could be possible. Maybe it's the combination of three supergroups \r\n(Karmakanic, TFK and The Tangent (both in line-up as in songstyle by the way) that is the secret here. I \r\nsimply can not believe what I'm hearing. I'd better stop before I start crying or something.\r\nThis must be one of the very very very best albums in my collection and I was already so satisfied so far \r\nwith that. What more can I say ? This album also saves this almost mediocre prog year for me.\r\nA superb masterpiece at last. Thank you, Karmakanic ! <p>PS I forgot the last two tracks of the album in my emotional outburst. Two quiet, almost ballad like \r\nmelancholic songs (first a short instrumental, the second with great vocals). 4,25 and 4,5* respectively.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=194464#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=194464\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=194464\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, December 20, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #194464)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8096\"><strong>Tarcisio Moura</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8096\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/8096/unspoken_Whisper.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOne of the last (and best surprises) of 2008! And I must thank my PA friend Progrules. If I hadn\u00b4t\r\nsee his review I\u00b4d probably skip this record. I had the first Karmakanic CD a few years ago and I\r\ndidn\u00b4t like it: it sounded too derivative and some of the tunes seemed to me like just pointless\r\njams, all done by great musicians, but definitly not my cup of tea. Well, it had a couple of tracks\r\nthat I liked, but that was not enough and I gave that  CD to a friend who was a Flower Kings fanatic\r\n(something I now regret). So I decided to forget about this project assuming they wouldn\u00b4t do\r\nanything better. But when I saw Progrules review (and others after that) I knew it might be good,\r\nsince we have a very similar taste. The praising were so high I decided to take my changes and get\r\nthe new album without hearing it.<p>Fortunatly all the reviews were right. Unlike its debut, Who\u00b4s The Boss In The Factory drips with\r\nconviction, passion and personality. And they are writing fantastic, symphonic prog songs! It is ok\r\nto me that the first track, the massive 19 minute epic Send A Message From The Heart sounds a lot\r\nlike a Flower Kings tune, but boy, is it good! In fact it could be in any of TFK best classic albums\r\nof the 90\u00b4s. It has all the elements that made TFK the giant band they were: melodic, epic, complex,\r\nvaried and holds your atention all the way through. That track alone is worth the price of the CD.\r\nBut there is more.<p>In the second song bassist and leader Jonas Reingold seems to be revisiting his own hard rock past\r\n(with band Midnight Sun): Let In Hollywood is the perfect short track between two great epics, being\r\nat the same time different and totally in harmony with the spirit of the album (great synth solo in\r\nthe middle). From then on all TFK connections fade away and the band shows they do have a very\r\nstrong sound and image. And more importante, know how to craft fine symphonic tunes. It is a sound\r\nthat is both complex and accessible. They have a host of guests featuring on this album (including\r\nthe ominous Roine Stolt) but what it is very clear here is that they are just that : guests, for the\r\nband itself is the main atraction (something missing from their debut). Only Theo Travis (of The\r\nTangent) sax is really outstanding on Two Blocks From The Edge. <p>It is hard to point a highlight since this is one of those few CDs that every track is so good and\r\ndifferent from the other that you can\u00b4t really compare them. The three epics are my obvious choice,\r\nbut all songs are excellent. Only the two parts of the poignant Eternity (Reingold\u00b4s homage to his\r\nlate parents) seems a bit out of place overall, but it is beautiful anyway (fine, emotional vocal\r\nperfomance by G\u00f6ran Edman). And it is a proof of the band\u00b4s versatility and great musical skill.  I\r\nhear this record non stop since I got it.<p>Conclusion: a must have for any prog lover.  4,5 stars at least. Thanks again, Henk!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=194962#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=194962\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=194962\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 25, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #194962)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nExcellent Symphonic rock album from Sweden.<p>The album is a side project from the bass player from the Flower Kings. Frankly, I did not know what\r\nto expect, and I did not like the sample in this website (from another album) very much. However,\r\nthe extremely high reviews around this net interested me. The cover intrigued me as well, thinking\r\nthat this will not be light stuff like the Wheel of Life sample here in progarchives. When it\r\narrived, I gave it a spin and got a little worried: the epic sounded very similar to the Flower\r\nKings' positive side while the second track sounded like a throwaway tune from The\r\nTangent. Fortunately, the cynical third track caught my attention, the fourth sounded very good on\r\nfirst listen, and the last two tracks amazed me. What about the first two tracks? well, the epic\r\ngrew on me a lot.<p>Karmakanic's Who's The Boss In The Factory? is an album which seems to be divided into three parts:<p>The first part consists of happy and melodic progressive rock in the form of The Flower Kings and\r\nThe Tangent (or if you don't know these bands, think of the melodic side of 70s Yes or Genesis). <strong>\r\nSend a Message From The Heart </strong> starts very innocent, developing its main theme, until it grabs\r\nyou with another theme played in heavy format (I love that part), then plays the main theme on\r\nguitar and the singing starts. The music has its changes, but it always stays positive and around\r\nminute 8, there's time for soloing and the amazing Zoltan&Reingold rhythm section. Afterwords, the\r\nsong continues its peace&love theme. <strong> Lost in Hollywood </strong> is my least favorite track and I do\r\nnot like the fast-paced pre-choruses, but I admit that it has a very catchy and amusing chorus in 7/8.<p>The second part is darker and features two long tracks. <strong> Who's The Boss In The Factory </strong> is a\r\ncynical dark track with unusual vocal-led choruses in a Roger Waters kind of style. They might take\r\na bit to grow on you, but are quite easy to singalong to. The instrumental break might be the best\r\npart of the CD, starting with a synth solo in front of a metal riff, continuing with dark and mellow\r\nmoods featuring a piano, and finishing with an excellent piano theme that is revisited in the end\r\nwith fiery electric guitars. <strong> Two Blocks From The Edge </strong> is probably the most accessible\r\ntrack. It is mostly a blues track with some twists, such as catchy choruses with strong sax lines.\r\nThe song is not as dark as the title track, but not as light as the first two songs.<p>The last part is the melancholic part of the album, featuring the song <strong> Eternally </strong> which is\r\ndivided into two parts. The music here has much less emphasis on being flashy, virtuosic, or catchy.\r\nIt focuses on pure raw emotion instead, and succeeds at it.  <strong> pt.1 </strong> is a beautiful piano solo\r\nplayed by a Weather Report founding member! <strong> pt.2 </strong> introduces the lyrics after a subdued\r\nintroduction and are not too direct. This is actually a song written about Reingold's parents who\r\nboth died in a carcrash. It's heartbreaking and you feel sad when hearing the music, despite not\r\nbeing dramatic in the case of The Cure or Radiohead. Eternally features accordion, which fits in\r\nperfectly and brings in an European flavor. You can tell the accordionist is a virtuoso and the\r\nnotes he chooses are spot on. The climax is a beautiful guitar solo and after it, strings and piano\r\nremain until the CD ends.<p>Give it a chance, especially if you are a fan of The Flower Kings or The Tangent.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=199252#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=199252\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=199252\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 15, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #199252)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23504\"><strong>Marty McFly</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23504\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23504/owl.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI think that now, after maybe year of listening this, I'm able review correctly. Firstly four stars, not five. Back then, in times of first listenings, I hated one or two songs here, so I gave four. Then I even stopped listening \"Boss\" at all. Not by purpose, it just wasn't too interesting. I listened to these tracks from time to time, but nothing serious. Only those I loved.<p>But as the time went bye, this aged like a precious wine. Then I finally got the idea to play it all. To give a chance to these great compositions. And I did right. The end.<p>End of story of course, not of review. \"Send a Message From the Heart\", starting with less weird intro than a lot of TFK material does. But it's funny. We can hear many influences through the track by these guys (when looking at crew members, nothing strange)<p>\"Let In Hollywood\" was the one that irritated me. I found first few lines of lyrics annoying, cheap and so on. But giving it time, the song (even short) grows. And kicks the bucket of consciousness with fast pace.<p>Eponymous \"Who's the Boss in THE Factory\" (we're not gonna use word \"da\", right ? drugs are bad, you know kids, riiiiight?) is more similar to first song. In few things, like song length, in feeling and both are interesting. Chorus here is also present and they know how to do their job. New thing is keyboard solo (with chorus) which changes into another keyboard solo (without chorus).<p>\"Two Blocks\" starts like something which can be cheesy normal rock. Also with strange lyrics. This song proves that is good, but I don't like it much. \"Hollywood\" yes, there I changed my mind, but this one not too much. Most of it, yes, but end is the best.<p>\"Eternally Part 1 and 2\" is nice ending, first in quiet piano style, then turning into marching-like tone (huh? I mean one beat to drums, then four in quick tempo). Then instrument I'm not able to identify (accordeon maybe) which reminds me French tango style. Very beautiful ending. <p>Except \"Blocks\" I can't see any flaw, even \"2 B\" has  most of it done right. Technically, there's no problem on anything, it's perfect work of experienced players.<p>5 stars, well deserved.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=208456#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=208456\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=208456\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, March 24, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #208456)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=21717\"><strong>lazland</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=21717\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/21717/C9F46CF2-046E-4575-B1C8-33DFCCEEC05A.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWhen I won this album on the PA monthly giveaway, posters said I was in for a treat. They were\r\nabsolutely spot on. This is a cracking, fantastic LP, and one I am very grateful to PA for adding\r\nthis to my collection.<p>The opener, Send a Message from the Heart, has epic written all over it, clocking in at over 19\r\nminutes. The start is amusing, when a little boy grabs hold of the microphone and begins to sing.\r\nThis gives way to a track full of keyboard and guitar solos of epic proportions and some incredible\r\nvocals by Goran Edman. As you would expect from a symphonic band's track of such a length, there are\r\nmany mood changes, varying from the delicate to the very heavy. It is a very complex piece of music\r\nand more than worth the price of the album alone, although, as I will make clear, even this is not\r\nthe highlight of the album.<p>Things get a lot heavier on Lost in Hollywood, as an acoustic beginning gives way to a powerful\r\nriff. It's very good, certainly for those who enjoy the heavier side of prog.<p>The title track clocks in at over 13 minutes, and I absolutely adore the thoughtful intro with piano\r\nand bass to the fore. The bass playing on this track by Jonas Reingold absolutely deserves special\r\nmention. When my wife & I played this for the first time at the weekend, both of us said it could\r\nwell be Chris Squire - there is no higher compliment. At times reminiscent of Floyd, at others Yes,\r\nthere are also some heavier moments, but throughout the musicianship is superb, and the mid One by\r\nOne, Step by Step passage is a joy to listen to, with the bass literally holding all together. The\r\nguitar solo towards the end is also epic, with large and loud organ bringing a great track to a\r\npulsating close.<p>Two Blocks from the Edge is easily the darkest piece of the album, and the sax pieces are very\r\nenjoyable. The rhythm section again keeps the track moving along at a fair pace. The guitar solos\r\nare, again, a joy for anyone who was brought up on hard rock. This track rocks.<p>Then to the conclusion, Eternally Parts 1 & 2. Quite simply the best new prog I have heard in many\r\nyears. I am not familiar with the history of the band members, as such, but it is dedicated to\r\nfamily members who clearly died in a car crash. Part One is a lovely piano solo, and then part two\r\nreally does tug at the heartstrings. Piano and bass in tandem create a melancholic mood. There are\r\nstrings to add to this, and the whole piece shrieks with loss. Then, after one & a half minutes,\r\nEdman kicks in with such a heartfelt vocal, accompanied by, of all things, an accordian solo\r\n(certainly the finest I've heard in prog!). This track simply cannot be compared to any other band\r\nor influence - it is utterly unique. Again, when we first listened to this at the weekend, we were\r\nboth reduced to utter silence, before I was instructed to place it on my wife's MP3 player - there\r\nis, believe me, no higher honour from someone not naturally predisposed to prog. But the mood,\r\nplaying, including one of the finest guitar solos I have ever heard in 32 odd years, make a track\r\nthat pulls you into a tragic event, but also uplifts you in the way that only the finest such tracks do.<p>The joy of this site is that it introduces us all to new experiences in prog. I freely admit that,\r\nprior to becoming a member, I had slipped into a comfort zone, and would never have listened to this\r\nand other bands. I think we all do at times. No more - I am hooked, and if you buy this LP, I swear\r\nyou won't regret it. By the way, when you listen to it, see if you can spot the Radiohead/Deep\r\nPurple moment in the chant.

To be honest, it would\r\nnot make any difference. When I was recommended this album, I had no idea of what to expect, I only\r\nknew it was some kind of new prog...<p>I have no answer to <strong>Who's the boss in the factory</strong> (I wish I had); what I know is that this\r\nalbum represents the new sound in modern symphonic prog rock, in the vein of The Flower Kings and\r\nSpock's Beard, or to put it more appropriately: what the sound of modern symphonic prog\r\n<em>should</em> be like: melodic but complex at the same time, creative and ''clever'', emotion-full\r\nand diverse. While the two bands mentioned above are the main references for KARMAKANIC's music,\r\nthis album has a little bit of everything; extensive use of acoustic guitar, heavy prog breaks,\r\nsaxophone soloing, top-level musicianship and many more...<p>The opening epic (~20 min) starts with an innocent childish voice singing the main tune and\r\nintroduces a neo-prog mid-tempo rhythm on which the track evolves, usually balancing between\r\nsymphonic prog rock and modern neo-prog with very strong and distinct bass lines. The brilliant\r\nvoice of Goran Edman is definitely an asset for this band - a very ''warm'' voice with many\r\ncapabilities in terms of diversity. The middle part of the track deals with experimental solos and a\r\nbit of jamming, which might sound a bit boring to some but adventurous to others; from there the\r\nsound returns to the opening tunes and the very melodic refrain lines.<p><strong>Let in Hollywood</strong> is a prog rock 'dynamite' to my ears; a clearly heavy-prog track in the vein\r\nof PRESTO BALLET with influences from URIAH HEEP (some vocals) and PORCUPINE TREE (guitar riffs).\r\nThe approach on this track, as the title implies, is more joyful and up-tempo than its predecessor\r\nand that differentiates it from the rest in this release that generally flow in a sadder\r\natmosphere.... such is the atmosphere that kicks-off in the title track; melancholic pianos and dark\r\nvocals. The refrain slightly changes the mood with the multiple, highly skilled vocal lines and a\r\ncharming melody. The track evolves to a mini-epic again with some inspiring bass melodies, jazzy\r\npianos and choral vocals throughout. Here you can find some of the best tunes in modern prog -\r\ndefinitely the most innovative song on the record.<p><strong>Two Blocks from the Edge</strong> generally flows in a similar mood but in a more ''ballad'' pattern\r\nwith beautiful vocals again (I have to repeat myself). The use of saxophone clearly lifts the\r\nquality and the level of enjoyment of this track. ''Sensible'' bass soloing from Jonas Reingold\r\napplies the final touches. <strong>Eternally</strong> (2 parts) starts with a virtuosic classical music piano\r\nintro that continues into the main part of the song in a more melancholic way. The melodies bring to\r\nmind music that you could hear somewhere in the streets of Italy... a beautiful accordion sound\r\naccompanies the track throughout, full of emotion, enchanting the listener - one of the highlights.<p>The weak points (if you can find some) for some prog fans in this ''message from the heart'' might\r\nbe the extensive soloing in some (limited) parts of the longer songs (that may sound annoying) and\r\nthe very emotion-full approach in the musicianship (making the album sound too ''sweet''?). Apart\r\nfrom that, I cannot see any major ''defects''. The most distinct positive aspects to my ears are the\r\nfantastic vocals and the smart bass melodies. <p>Recommended to modern symphonic prog fans (especially melodic) - not recommended to those not keen\r\non ''too much emotion in a prog record''... almost a masterpiece to my ears though I can understand\r\nthose that assign 5 stars to it.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220917#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220917\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=220917\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, June 13, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #220917)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nTalking about Karmakanic we cannot ignore the existence of bands like The Flower Kings and The\r\nTangent as they all actually big family. As far as The Flower Kings concern one of the musicians\r\nthat I admire his skills is Jonas Reingold (bass guitar). In The Flower Kings he has played his bass\r\nguitar wonderfully and in fact he is one of the best prog rock bass players of the 90's and 2000's.\r\nWell, the third rebirth of progressive rock was quite impressive with bands like Spock's Beard,\r\nPorcupine Tree, Transatlantic in addition to The Flower Kings. The interesting thing about Jonas\r\nReingold was that during his spare time he composed music and joined forces with Roine Stolt, Jaime\r\nSalazar, Zoltan Cs\u00f6rz, Johan Gl\u00f6ssner, G\u00f6ran Edman, Robert Engstrand and Tomas Bodin, all prominent\r\nmembers of the progressive rock family. Karmakanic was born with good debut album 'Entering the\r\nSpectra' (2002) followed with 'Wheel of Life' (2004). <p>This third album titled as 'Who's The Boss In The Factory' (2008) represents the best release so\r\nfar. It sounds to me that the band has been perfecting their compositions learning from their\r\nprevious two releases. The beauty of prog music is when we previously had an album that was not\r\nquite impressive and later on we find another excellent release of the band we try to trace back the\r\nolder albums. That comes true with me as I spin this album and I start to have curiosity with its\r\nprevious release 'Wheel of Life' which when I re-spin the CD again I have another perspective about\r\nthe band. In general, Karmakanic I could say is the prominent prog rock band of the 2000s as this\r\nalbum proves to me.<p><strong>Do not try to understand, just enjoy it ...!</strong><p>For me, this album is quite hard to understand and it reminds me to when I first enjoyed Yes 'Tales\r\nfrom Topographic Ocean' for the first time in the 70's. I think I spun until more than 5 times and I\r\nstill did not get it quite right in my ears, so was the case with 'Topographic'. Then I remember\r\nwith The Flower Kings 'Paradox Hotel' where I experienced similar thing. I felt that I was being\r\n'topgrahicized' by Jonas Reingold and his friends. But when I tried to enjoy the music segment by\r\nsegment I found the treasure on how great Reingold's bass playing in any segment I paid particular\r\nattention to. Not only that ?Zoltan Csorsz's drums as well as Lalle Larsson's keyboard playing. And\r\nI then tried to shift my paradigm from <strong>trying to understand</strong> the music to <strong>just enjoy</strong> it. <p>The major cause is I think because the opening track 'Send A Message From The Heart' is an epic that\r\ndoes not sound quite catchy at first spin and it took me many spins to be able to enjoy it. The\r\ntrack that consumes  more than 19 minutes duration has practically little orientation towards a song\r\nbecause it changes unexpectedly in medium to fast tempo. Melody-wise there is nothing peculiar that\r\nI can draw from the epic but when I look into segment by segment movement it started to create an\r\nenjoyment to me and it really grew on me. And .. well, yeah .. I finally really love this opening\r\ntrack and its powerful lyrics. The ending part of this epic sounds like the epic continues to Roine\r\nStolte's debut album titled 'The Flower King'. I think the band did it intentionally.<p>When the band plays the next track 'Let In Hollywood' (4:53), it does not really favor me especially\r\nthe intro part that comprises acoustic guitar rhythm in fast tempo with energetic vocal line by\r\nG\u00f6ran Edman. Unfortunately it's not something that creates enjoyment to my ears. But as the song\r\nmoves I like the way keyboard plays its solo in the vein of Chick Corea in 'Return to Forever'. On\r\ntop of that, the guitar solo is stunning and rockin' ?<p>The title track 'Who's the Boss In The Factory' (13:04) is another great track with intro part which\r\nstarts with lyrical words 'One by One ?step by step' has similar style with Roger Water's 'What God\r\nWants' in 'Amused to Death' album. I think the band was not aware of it and it does not quite bother\r\nme at all. This song is quite unique as it blends beautifully the components of symphonic prog with\r\njazz rock fusion style like Chick Corea's 'Return to Forever' band. I can see clearly through the\r\npiano work by Larsson where he provides nice shot during the musical break where plays catchy notes\r\nsoftly and it moves wonderfully into jazzy music where piano takes the lead as soloist. Not only\r\npiano that sounds nicely, the guitar solo is truly stunning and rockin' ..it reminds me to the\r\nguitar sound typically played by Mick Box of Uriah Heep fame.<p>'Two Blocks From The Edge' (9:51) starts mellow in the Floydian ambient through the use of guitar\r\nsolo. The song moves with saxophone as soloist as well as rhythm section at background when vocal\r\nenters. The song features nice bass guitar solo in the middle of the song. I am really impressed\r\nwith Reingold even though he does not play complex bass guitar solo but the sound is really great\r\nespecially when it continues with guitar and sax solo. Acoustic guitar also creates good texture\r\ncombined with stunning electric guitar solo by Krister Jonsson who plays in different style compared\r\nto Roine Stolt.<p>The closing tracks 'Eternally Part I' (1:51) and 'Eternally Part II' (6:21) make an excellent\r\nclosure to this album, overall. With the first part focusing on piano solo in classical and jazzy\r\nstyle, it opens a great gateway to the next final track, Part II. Part II is a wonderful track with\r\ngreat combination of bass guitar solo and piano touch back beautifully by string arrangement. Bass\r\nguitar plays as main melody while piano creates fills strengthened by string section. When vocal\r\nline enters it sounds jazzy style with clarinet serves as filler at back ground. It's a mellow track\r\nwith great clarinet / soprano sax solo and excellent piano playing.<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><p>If I were requested to make review with only three spins of the album I would give only three stars\r\nrating because the music was quite hard to understand. But I have listened to this album in its\r\nentirety fo more than eight (8) spins and it really grew on me everytime I listened to it, I finally\r\ncannot afford to give this wonderful album with less than five stars. It's really a masterpiece!\r\nRemember, do not try to understand the music! Just enjoy it segment by segment. If you cannot enjoy\r\nit, use Sennheiser PX-100 (PX-200 is better) headphone on your ears and play it loud. I believe you\r\nwould enjoy it. Keep on proggin' ..! ?because proggin' is healthy and it cheers your life,\r\ndefinitely ...!!!<p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=225878#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=225878\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=225878\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 10, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #225878)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=7397\"><strong>Rivertree</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Band Submissi&#111;ns</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=7397\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070913_054302_rivertreelogo4.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt only matters who's the boss in the factory! This time bass player Jonas Reingold - responsible\r\nfor the songwriting and production. He's part of a musical family also including members of The\r\nFlower Kings, Kaipa, The Tangent and uncounted side projects. Don't know where this album/song title\r\ncomes from (not that good in interpreting lyrics). I'm quite sure the relationship between those\r\nmusicians bears more democratic structures compared to a factory. Otherwise it would be hard to\r\nexplain how they could reach for such an excellent output. Now that I saw them live some weeks ago\r\nit's really about time to write my impressions down.<p>Looking at the core line-up there is only one member I wasn't aware of so far - keyboarder Lalle\r\nLarsson. But - no wonder - his contributions are really great too. And this kind of richness also\r\ncomes from the vast number of friends who contributed to the album I'm sure. When starting to listen\r\nto <strong>Send A Message From The Heart</strong> - including a short intro offered by Reingold's son Alex -\r\nyou might have the impression that this is another TFK effort. It's the epic song structure, the\r\ncomplete implementation. A cornucopia of impressions including Genesis and Pink Floyd references\r\nplus breaks and turns en masse. Starting with marching drums, mellotron, nice vocals ... and of\r\ncourse Reingold's accentuated bass playing showing an impressing bandwith from heavy to melancholic. <p>Not necessary to emphasize that this is highly melodic. All in all it has the spirit of 'Hotel\r\nParadox'. You won't miss fusion parts dominated by synthesizer and Jonsson's jazzy guitar. But all\r\nin all this is a heavier sound. Second track <strong>Let In Hollywood</strong> is initiated by acoustic guitar\r\nbut soon develops to an uptempo art rock thing with a harder vibe. The title track is much more\r\nepical structured once more. 'One by one, step by step ...' - the catchy main refrain is impressing\r\n- inviting for singing along really. Lalle Larsson's diversified work strikes - piano and multiple\r\nsynthesizer layers and on top of it we are offered a charming bass solo.<p><strong>Two Blocks From The Edge</strong> comes like another shouter so to say with a rocking fundament. Theo\r\nTravis manages the saxophone parts - nice, nice. Both parts of <strong>Eternally</strong> hold Reingold's\r\nemotional impact finally, reflecting the loss of his parents. So we have a melancholic piano\r\npresence first - later coupled with Reingold's bass and background strings. Then this song developes\r\nto a gripping ballad with great vocals by G\u00f6ran Edman - wonderful!  <p>This is a friggin' killer album - a highlight of the year 2008! Roine Stolt is (nearly) missing\r\nhere. He's not the boss surprisingly, only appearing on one song but involved in the mixing process\r\nanyhow. Not a pure symphonic prog album - it's more - rich of different impressions and approving\r\nmuch experience based on a high level of musicianship and compositorial skills.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=246901#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=246901\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=246901\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, October 28, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #246901)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nNeo-sympho-prog is the kind of music I usually avoid but since this Karmakanic has got such a good\r\nreception I decided to ignore my recent Transatlantic trauma and have a go at it anyway.<p>Well I'm glad I did, even though, as I had feared, it has turned out to be a rather frustrating\r\nexperience. Not because it is any bad but because I hear so much potential here that does not get\r\nfulfilled. Or rather, it gets fulfilled, but then crushed down again the next moment. Generally,\r\nthis band plays excellent symphonic prog with lots of interesting grooves, progressions, solos and\r\nhigh-standard musicianship but, hmm, those vocals again.<p>The sticky finale around minute 17.00 of the epic <em>Send a message from the heart</em> serves as an\r\ngood example, so much gospel-flavoured melodrama is hard to swallow, especially if you compare it to\r\nthe great things they can achieve on the fusion infected guitar solo that follows right after it.\r\nCan a song get any more frustrating? How am I supposed to enjoy that solo without having to succumb\r\nto the vocals that precede it. (Well maybe that solo isn't all that great but just sounds good\r\nbecause the preceding part is so weak, a cunning trick for sure!)<p>The remainder of the album isn't much more consistent and keeps going back and forth between fun\r\nprog rock like <em>Let In Hollywood</em> and trite commercial rock vocals as in <em>Two Blocks From The\r\nEdge</em>. The title track is great and so is the album closer <em>Eternally</em>, at least till they\r\ndecide to 'do a Queen' on it and spoil the last 2 minutes with bombastic pathos and big hallow\r\nsentimental gestures.<p>This time I can at least understand the excitement around this but I can't fully share it. Well,\r\nit's certainly a lot better then Transatlantic and I guess I'll return to listen to it. Still,\r\nfrustrating, as it is almost so darn good. 3.5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=253809#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=253809\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=253809\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 1, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #253809)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15960\"><strong>CCVP</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15960\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15960/130464717833.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Second (or even third) class Flower Kings album</strong><p>The Flower Kings is (or are, but anyway) a rather unique band that have released absolutely wondrous\r\nalbums throughout its existence in such a way that, by now, the band has reached some kind of\r\nmythical place in the progressive rock Pantheon alongside with the traditional important progressive\r\nrock bands, such as Yes, Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Genesis. So, like it or not, those kings of\r\nflowers are a <strong>must </strong> for anyone that is exploring the world of progressive rock and is\r\nexperiencing the many styles or sub-genres of progressive rock since its sudden reappearance in the\r\nearly 90's, because they are such an important band for the genre for the past 15 years and released\r\na studio album almost every year, having a rather extense discography.<p>However, in recent years, since the release of their 2007 album entitled The Sum of No Evil, the\r\ncore band members begun working more eagerly on their own solo projects than on the band itself:\r\nRoine Stolt put out an album of yet another solo project of his, called Agents of Mercy, and got\r\ntogether with his old friends and regrouped Transatlantic, Tomas Bodin released two solo albums\r\nsince 2007, which are called Cinematograaf and You Are (with another band called Eggs & Dogs rather\r\nthan by himself, but he is the leader of it anyway), the second part of the trilogy started in the\r\n2005 album I AM, and, last but now least, Jonas Reingold released this album, entitled Who's The\r\nBoss In The Factory?. <p>There is one problem, however, with those solo efforts from those band members of Flower Kings:\r\nsince they are the main writers of the band, in one way or another, their solo albums will sound\r\nlike a Flower Kings album, but, since they are solo efforts, the result is, most of the times, not\r\nas great as it could be. Karmakanic's latest effort is in no way an exception to that rule. Who's\r\nThe Boss In The Factory? is not a bad album by itself, but the thing is there seems to be something\r\nmissing, and <strong>THAT</strong> something missing is what make this album's overall quality suffer. Of\r\ncourse, there are new things here that you would not expect to be in a Flower Kings album, and those\r\nare very pleasant surprises, but still unable to fully bring the album up or to make the album brighter.<p>The only song that really stand out is the opening track, entitled Leave a Message from the Heart,\r\nwhich is a great epic, but honorable mentions need to be done to the enthusiastic Two Blocks from\r\nthe Edge and to the melodic and sentimental Eternally (parts 1 and 2)<p>The highlights go to: Leave a Message from the Heart, Two Blocks from the Edge and Eternally.<p><em>Grade and Final Thoughts</em><p>Who's The Boss In The Factory? is a quite good album, I must say, but it is unable to give me any\r\nthrills beyond the opening track, and do remembers quite a lot that other Swede band called Flower\r\nKings. Because of all that, three stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=261022#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=261022\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=261022\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, January 15, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #261022)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25731\"><strong>EatThatPhonebook</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25731\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25731/anno-domini-high-definiti&#111;n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe Typical overrated modern symphonic prog album. Maybe it's just me, I didn't like it so much. I found it kinda boring and without any moments of enthusiasm that are usually typical of symphonic prog. The only good song for me is \" Let in Hollywood\", while \" Send a Message To The heart\" is a 19 minute song, which bores most of the time, being a useless effort for the listener. \" Two blocks from the Edge\" is similar, much less long (9 minutes), with very few good ideas. Even the Eternally songs aren't so good. I don't understand how many people loved it.

The omens weren't too good: one look at the cover and I was afraid\r\nthis was just one more product from InsideOut's prog factory. But \"Send a Message from the \r\nHeart\", the near-twenty minute opening track, blew me away. Rousing melodies, stately \"symphonic\" \r\narrangements, wild Moraz-like synthesizer solos and surprisingly jazzy (almost Holdsworthian) guitar \r\nsolos: the piece had it all. Besides, you could easily listen to it just for Jonas Reingold's magisterial \r\ntrebly bass. It seemed Karmakanic had a better chance of impressing me with their \"epics\" \r\nthan most of their coevals.<p>However, on subsequent spins the glory of \"Message to the Heart\" diminished somewhat. It \r\ndepends how cynical a mood I'm in. On certain days I'm prepared to get carried away by \r\nfake-sincere vocals. On other days I simply can't take lines like \"Compassion leads your way into \r\nthe sun on your way to paradise\". I understand that most symphonic prog bands will try to sound uplifting, but a \r\nclich\u00e9 is a clich\u00e9, no matter what.<p>And to my regret the remainder of the album failed to reach the level of excitement of that opening track. \r\nThe second piece, \"Let in Hollywood\", is conventional Flower Kings-style rock, based on a blunt hard \r\nrocking riff. The third track (the title piece) sounds like another superfluous attempt to rebuild THE WALL, \r\nalthough it's redeemed a little by yet another (brief) Moraz-style synth solo, and a splendid middle \r\nsection on piano. \"Two Blocks from the Edge\" is worse: histrionic vocals AND histrionic lead guitar only reveal run-of-the-mill adolescent angst. Empty lyrics like \"What's the question, what's the answer, this life is killing me\" are chucked at the listener, yet the music never speaks of true emotion. \r\n(To be fair, the piece ends with some truly elegant electric guitar flourishes, but it's a case of too little too \r\nlate.) The final track, \"Eternally\" (parts one and two), is Reingold's requiem for his parents, who perished \r\nin a car crash in 2007, and I hate to say it (for in this case the composer's feelings must have been all too \r\nreal) but both music and lyrics are almost unbearably sentimental.<p>Verdict: Good in part, but not necessarily better than the dozens of symphonic prog albums that get\r\nchurned out every month.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=263188#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=263188\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=263188\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 28, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #263188)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5162\"><strong>Evolver</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Crossover &amp; JR/F/Canterbury Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5162\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5162/ec.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI wish I liked this album more. The musicians are certainly very talented.  But the album just \r\nisn't consistent.<p>It starts out spectacularly.  The first track, <I>Send A Message From The Heart</I>, a nineteen \r\nminute epic, is everything a symphonic prog epic should be: grand in scope, different \r\nmovements that flow perfectly from one pert to the next, and played by musicians who are \r\neasily up to the task of this difficult to master genre.<p>After that, the album tails off.  The next two tracks are good, but nowhere near as good as the \r\nopening track.  <I>Let In Hollywood</I> is a rocker in 7 (it even tells you this in the lyrics).  It's \r\nkind of catchy, and pleasant.  The title track, <I>Who's The Boss In The Factory</I> is fun, but \r\nnot terribly prog.  It reminds me a bit of the <I>It Bites</I> album I own. <p>Then there's <I>Two Blocks From The Edge</I>, this song is hard to review, because I seem \r\nto forget it right after each listen.  That's not a good sign.  And the two-part <I>Eternally</I> is \r\njust too light for my tastes.<p>Since the first third is great, the second third is just okay, and the third third is...\r\nThree stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=277929#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=277929\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=277929\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, April 14, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #277929)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI haven't had much luck when it comes to KARMAKANIC.  I couldn't really get into their first two \r\nalbums and had no intention of checking this one out until seeing all these rave reviews one \r\nafter another. Well like the three collaborators before me I too have to give this 3 stars. This is \r\ntheir most impressive release by far in my opinion but there's too many moments that I either \r\ndislike or could do without to give it 4 stars. Lots of guests on this one including Andy \r\nTillison, Roine Solt, Tomas Bodin,Theo Travis and more. The best part of this album is the \r\nformer FLOWER KINGS rhythm section of Reingold and Csorsz.<p>\r\nThe first track is the best on the album bar none. No complaints for this almost 20 minute \r\nopener. It's one of those rides that always seems too short. \"Let In Hollywood\" is catchy but i'm \r\nnot enjoying it at all until it gets heavier 2 minutes in. It settles back again. <p>\"Who's The Boss In \r\nThe Factory\" is a good track except for chorus which is very annoying for me because of the \r\nFLOYD reference which is all over it. \"Two Blocks From The Edge\" is good with the guitar \r\ncrying out early. I like the bass after 5 minutes and the guitar, organ and sax that \r\nfollows. \"Eternally Part I\" is a short piano themed piece. \"Eternally Part II\" is melancholic with \r\npiano and violin leading early. Not a fan of this one.<p>\r\nA good album with a killer opening track.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=280045#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=280045\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=280045\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, April 30, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #280045)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=35306\"><strong>Wicket</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=35306\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/35306/f&#111;nz.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt's not everyday you come across a very talented group of musicians with a sense of humor \r\nand relationship with The Flower Kings (thanks to bassist Jonas Reingold).<p>Yet he's now got an official group that compares and now, even rivals that of The Flower \r\nKings.<p>This whole cavalcade of Swedes knows how to make music, and they know how to do it in a \r\nhumorous fashion (where else would you find a song in 7/8 with the band singing about \r\n7/8?), seen in \"Let In Hollywood\". You can instantly tell on the opening of \"Send A Message \r\nFrom The Heart\". While the intro may have been better without the childish singing intro, you \r\ncan just tell from the bombastic, somewhat lengthy intro that you're in for a 20 minute long \r\nepic. As such, there are some influences still lingering from The Flower Kings, yet as you \r\ntransition from \"Entering The Spectra\" to \"Wheel Of Life\" and finally to this record, you'll \r\nnotice the pattern; Roine Stolt was featured heavily on \"Spectra\", not as much on \"Wheel\" \r\nbut the sound was still there. Here, there is no guest appearance by Stolt and this is the \r\ndisc that creates Karmakanic's sound, not a \"Flower Kings spin-off\" sound.<p>One thing to immediately take off this first track alone; the keys are definitely more \r\npredominant. Yes, The Flower Kings used keys extensively, but mostly for symphonic and \r\natmospheric purposes. I would consider this an Eclectic or Neo prog group myself. The \r\ntechnical ability of Lalle Larsson is phenomenal, as evidenced by his solo midway through \r\nthe track. Of course, Larsson is a fantastic musician, but the sound of Krister Jonsson just \r\nscreams \"70's Pink Floyd\" guitar. There are always those musicians who relate to having \r\nthat special guitar sound, the one you can just pick out from a mile away.<p>I guess we can say he just loved that sound. <p>Of course, good songwriting helps too, and the slow, ballad-esque section in the tune \r\nexemplifies that. After all, Stolt practically built the entire career of The Flower Kings on \r\nhappy, sappy, hippy tunes (obviously he drifted away from that philosophy, but you get my \r\npoint), so you can obviously hear the resemblance there. Other than the fact that the \r\ninstrumentation is fantastic, it's just your typical double digit minute long symphonic prog \r\nmonstrosity.<p>\"Let In Hollywood\" is one of those quirky songs which, in most case, fail, because most \r\nprog bands never succeed in the \"pop\" department. Technically, this song will never make it \r\nto the Top 100, but it is a nice change of pace from the mammoth just before it. This 7/8 pop \r\ntrack makes good use of the time signature (and the lyrics that actually sing about 7/8), but \r\ndespite it's attempt, I still hold it as a wonderful track. After all, when was the last time you \r\nheard a decent pop song (in general) in 7/8?<p>The self-titled track starts off in a more mournful, foreboding tone than it's larger, happier \r\ncounterpart. It almost brings me to a sense of pop blending with Riverside or Oceansize, or \r\nmore accurately, Tinyfish. G\u00f6ran Edman tries to manipulate the title words into a catchy \r\nverbing, but to not much avail. However, it is a wonderful track that very much differs from \r\n\"Send A Message\". While the former stays true to the symphonic genre, the latter definitely \r\ntouches on the Neo-prog side of the genre, even eclectic at times (evidenced by the mini \r\nfunk rock section in the middle highlighted by an abbreviated Larsson solo). There still is \r\ninstrumentation towards the back half of the track, highlighted again by Larsson, jumping \r\nback and forth between a Porcupine Tree song and a 60's raindance song. It's more of an \r\ninstrumental buildup and jam, rather then a round robin passing game of solos and fills.<p>Of course, from a somewhat stale (depending on your point of view), instrumental wise, \r\n\"Two Blocks From The Edge\" starts off with that predictable, lovable guitar sound from \r\nJonsson. Oddly enough, it seems to take another direction towards The Flower Kings, \r\nbefore the sax kicks in and it feels like \"Boss, Pt. 2\". Normally, this variance between \r\nalbums would tick me off, but as I listen to \"Spectra\" and \"Wheel Of Life\", they were both \r\nmore symphonic in style and texture. Now, this band seems to be embracing both eclectic \r\nand neo styles in order to broaden their horizon and create their signature sound. \r\nRemember, these guys are Karmakanic, not a Flower Kings side-project.<p>One thing I found interesting is why \"Eternally\" is divided into two parts. Eventually I realized \r\npart one was just an open solo for Larsson, while part two just stems off from it into its own \r\nsong, although it still feels like a Larsson solo track. The added sounds of what sounds like \r\na high pitched clarinet give it an almost, eh, \"Italian restaurant\" feel, for lack of a better term. \r\nIt's a poor way to finish an album, but as a standstill track, it's a wonderful ballad of sorts.<p>It's truly a fantastic album, the defining piece of music for this band's repetoir. This album \r\nhas clearly defined their sound with their mix of symphonic elements, to their dabbling of \r\neclectic and neo prog elements, as well as their \"Pink Floydian\" guitar sounds and \r\nelements mixed in. Jonas Reingold has finally removed the \"Flower Kings side project\" \r\nlabel from this outfit and put this band to the upper echelon of modern progressive rock \r\nnames like The Flower Kings and Spock's Beard.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=491325#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=491325\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=491325\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, July 27, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #491325)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12334\"><strong>b_olariu</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12334\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12334/4927969.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThird album of Karmakanic named Who's the boss in the factory released in 2008 is to a little let\r\ndawn from previous one, who already was not a masterpiece to my ears.

The only\r\ntruly great piece is the opening 30 min track Send A Message From The Heart that show Karmakanic in\r\ngood form but also a very TFK sound, much more present then on previous album.  Not very much to say\r\nor add, even has decent moments overall, I can't love it and is far less intresting then previous\r\nrelease, this type of sugary symphonic prog with loveble instrumental parts is not really my thing,\r\nbut in same time I can't say is a bad record.

Without even given the band a listen, I ordered the album and, fortunately, to no regret. \r\n(Credit going to my friend who clearly understood my playlist!)<p>I knew nothing of the band as I listened to the first track, \"Send a Message from the Heart\" but it wasn't long before \r\nI concluded that there were very strong similarities to the Flower Kings. Of course, as it turns out, Jonas Reingold \r\n(bass, fretless bass, keyboards, production) also plays bass with the Flower Kings. Additionally, Flower King \r\nkeyboard player Tomas Bodin appears on this album and Roine Stolt provides some guitar and mixing, too. Now it \r\nall makes sense! Very much a song in a Flower Kings' vein.<p><p>\"Let in the Hollywood\" might be the weak track for some because it is short and sounds like it was prepared for a \r\nhopeful radio single. It has an eighties pop melody accompanied by a more hard rock sound that, in the middle, \r\ngets heavier (my favourite part!). The funny thing is that even though this sounds like it could have been a radio \r\nsingle, the chorus sings, \"I can't hear a single / This song in seven eight\". By coincidence, I had recently watched a \r\nYouTube video explaining simple time signatures in popular music and the video mentioned that Pink Floyd's \r\n\"Money\" is in seven eight. So not only was I able to pick out the 7/8 time of the chorus but I also enjoyed the ironic \r\nstatement claiming this song couldn't be a single in 7/8 even though \"Money\" was a huge single success!<p><p>My favourite track on the album has to be \"Who's the Boss in the Factory?\". It begins like a requiem and then \r\nchanges heading towards a slightly upbeat sound before turning into a proper rock song that then gets a little \r\nheavy again before easing back. The instrumental part stretches out a bit with some piano and lead guitar.<p><p>\"Two Blocks from the Edge\" is different but still follows the same thread of blending pop melodies with progressive \r\nrock music. The solo piano of \"Eternally Pt. 1\" is really lovely and it demonstrates the classical piano talents of, I'm \r\nguessing, Mr. Lalle Larsson (three people receive keyboard credits but only Larsson is credited solely with \r\nkeyboards).<p><p>The album is, as I said, very similar to a Flower Kings album but with some touches, such as the piano, that stand \r\napart from FK. One should also note that the bass guitar is often easy to pick out and even gets some lead work. \r\nOne part is clearly composed for piano and bass guitar. I do love the bass, so this album appeals to my bass fetish \r\nside very nicely. (My playlist also included a lot of songs that feature bass guitar prominently and my friend \r\nmentioned above is a bass player.) As a modern progressive rock album it plays very well with my personal \r\npreferences being for the three songs in the middle.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1616918#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1616918\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1616918\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, September 29, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1616918)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHere is another review that I wrote a long time ago without posting...<p>Symphonic lovers, you should be aware of this album. Superb vocal harmonies, gorgeous melodies, and skilled guitar \r\nparts. What else? I don't know, but you get them all during the very good opening number and epic: \"Send A Message \r\nFrom The Heart\" that almost peaks at twenty minutes. THE highlight here.<p>Huge influences from some of the major bands who are the soul and spirit of this site are of course abundant: \"Yes\" by \r\ndefault (but that's nothing new under the TFK umbrella). The guitar work is excellent and this epic is definitely worth a \r\nlisten. <p>It is an excellent start by all means. Do I need to add that some keys parts are solidly being built? In all: a very good \r\nprog epic, my friends. The only problem is that to keep the same quality level throughout the whole album will be \r\ndifficult.<p>There are no weak songs to be featured on this album. Even if the title song leans more on the heavy metal tones \r\n(some might say prog metal, but I have always been alien to this concept), but some jazzy parts might poor some \r\ndelights to your prog ears. A nice attempt should I say?<p>Needless to say that not all of the songs featured on this album are on par. \"Two Blocks From The Edge\" is too \r\ntechnical and loose to be able to convince me. But it's almost normal to have some weaker numbers out here? Right!<p>The whole is flamboyant, crafted and mostly elegant. Still, a too jazzy angle prevents me to score it higher than three \r\nstars. But the closing and truly symphonic \"Eternally\" is really great. What an emotional guitar break!  <p>It is a good album indeed. With several very good songs.<p>Three stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2119257#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2119257\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2119257\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, January 18, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=19596#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2119257)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n                                        \r\n                                                                       'Variety and musical ideas rule!'\r\n\r\nI had never heard of Karmakanic, the solo project by The Flower Kings bass player Jonas Reingold, but that has to \r\ndo with the fact that I am not rea\r\n...
