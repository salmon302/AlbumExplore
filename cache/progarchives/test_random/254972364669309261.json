As in the case of its predecessor, 2000's \"Brave New World\",\r\nit shares quite a lot with the efforts of progressive metal bands such as Dream\r\nTheater and their ilk, while being at the same time rooted in the band's straighter\r\nheavy metal past. <p>\r\nThe stylish, red-and-black cover and booklet  contain some impressive pictures of the\r\nblack-clad band members, shot at the historic English mansion of Luton Hoo With the\r\nsole exception of the two initial tracks, most of the songs are over the 5 minute\r\nmark, with epics \"Paschendale\" and \"Dance of Death\" clocking at almost 9 minutes.\r\nWhile retaining Maiden's signature rumbling, galloping bass lines and fast, furious\r\nriffing, the sound is distinctly mellower and more melodic;  the influence of the\r\nhistoric prog bands beloved of both Steve Harris and Bruce Dickinson is also clearly\r\nin evidence, especially in the longer tracks, with their complex, string- and\r\nkeyboard-laden arrangements. <p>\r\nOpener \"Wildest Dreams\" and the following \"Rainmaker\" are both dynamic,\r\ntextbook-Maiden songs with catchy choruses - good, though rather straightforward,\r\nclassic metal tracks. Then the title-track comes in to prove how the band have\r\ncontinued to develop their trademark, metal-with-brains  sound in the proggier\r\ndirection already shown by the Bayley-era albums. Written by Steve Harris (who took\r\nthe inspiration from one of his dreams) and guitarist Janick Gers, the song begins\r\nwith a haunting acoustic melody, over which Dickinson's powerful, impassioned\r\ndelivery soars; then develops into a majestic cavalcade, powered by dazzling solos by\r\neach of the three axemen. \"No More Lies\" starts in much the same restrained, almost\r\nwistful  vein, climaxing in a full-blown, energetic romp; while \"Monts\u00e9gur\",\r\ndedicated to the 13th-century massacre of the Cathars in the south of France, is\r\nsharply reminiscent of vintage Maiden tunes such as \"Run to the Hills\". <p>\r\nFor those more interested in Maiden's proggy side, the moody, atmospheric, World War\r\nI-themed \"Paschendale\", with its distinctive stop-start structure and a towering\r\nvocal performance by Dickinson, is without any doubt the album's pi\u00e8ce de resistance,\r\ntogether with the title-track and surprise closer \"Journeyman\" - a melancholy,\r\ncompletely acoustic, medieval-influenced ballad, in which Dickinson proves he is\r\nequally at ease as a sensitive interpreter of mood pieces as he is as the screamer\r\nidolised by millions of heavy metal fans. <p>\r\nEven though not always fully appreciated by Iron Maiden's loyal following, \"Dance of\r\nDeath\" is a well-crafted, skilfully performed album by a band at the top of their\r\ngame. Open-minded prog fans will find a lot to enjoy in this interesting record,\r\nwhich alternates high-energy moments with intricate, sprawling epics that could\r\nproudly stand beside the output of many celebrated prog-metal bands.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93630#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93630\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93630\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, October 6, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93630)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOne of Iron Maiden's strongest albums, even if the material isn't really new in terms\r\nof style. I guess Iron Maiden recently sticks to what they are best at, releasing\r\nsafe, yet solid albums. Dance of Death is better than Brave New World, due to the\r\nmore memorable riffs, more sophisticated songwriting, and better melodies. While the\r\nstyle is similar, the sound of Iron Maiden keeps progressing into \"prog\" and the\r\nmusic is getting mellower. The 'proggiest' songs are the two epics: the title track\r\nand Paschandale.<p><strong> Wildest Dreams </strong> opens the album with a bang, a totally catchy and energetic\r\nopener with good guitar riffs, catchy choruses, and a time change that works very\r\nwell, giving way to a beautiful guitar lead. <strong> Rainmaker </strong> is a straightforward\r\nand radio-friendly tune. <strong> No More Lies </strong> is a very good song, but the intro\r\nriff and the similar electric riff sound recycled from the instrumental break on\r\ntheir epic \"Nomad\". They use screams and pounding guitar riffs for the choruses and\r\nthe instrumental section (climax) does not disappoint. <strong> Montsegur </strong> is the\r\nheaviest song of the album and has an arsenal of great guitar riffs, the best one\r\nbeing the one playing on the verses and the first guitar solo. The double guitar\r\nperformances recall their classic \"The Trooper\". The vocalist sounds desperate and\r\nalmost screaming throughout the song. <strong> Gates of Tomorrow </strong> and <strong> New Frontier\r\n</strong> are a bit mediocre, as they sound ordinary and do not have any strong hooks. <strong>\r\nFace in the Sand </strong> sounds like the best material from their album X-Factor, only\r\nthat it has Bruce Dickinson! It has a great dark introduction with excellent bass and\r\natmospheric guitar playing until strings make the song more symphonic. The guitar\r\nbreak in minute 4 is wonderful. <strong> Age of Innocence </strong> is a powerful and energetic\r\ntune, not a highlight though. <strong> Journeyman </strong> is a different song for Iron\r\nMaiden. No electric guitars. Instead, it is acoustic, with strings to set the mood.\r\nThe vocal performance in this song is some of the best since Bruce returned to the\r\nband; I can't help but enjoy his singing a lot during the choruses.<p><strong> Dance of Death </strong> has one of the best introductions of an Iron Maiden song,\r\never. It is soft and spooky during the first few minutes. \"Let me tell you a story to\r\nchill the bones\". The acoustic riff is very simple but effective, and the short\r\nguitar solo in the beginning is beautiful. Then, it changes pace into a more\r\nbeautiful acoustic theme, then it changes pace into an even more beautiful acoustic\r\nchord progression. Before you know it, the chorus plays with nice string arrangements\r\nand a mad instrumental break begins, showing you that Iron Maiden is not really\r\nfollowing a standard song structure. Then it turns into a heavier section instead of\r\nrepeating a verse, and plays the crazy riff of the instrumental break again as a main\r\nriff. Instead of going to a second chorus, you get a long instrumental break with\r\nsoloing. After another new theme, the mad riff plays again and leads to the\r\nintroductory acoustic riff+elegant guitar solo just like the beginning with a good\r\ntransition.<p><strong> Paschendale </strong> is my favorite Iron Maiden song and truly a progressive metal\r\nsong, with shifting time signatures, time changes, and unusual song structure. The\r\nmain theme is especially strange, with soft percussion playing a time signature I\r\ncan't decipher and a midi-sounding guitar playing a nice and elegant riff. This\r\nshifts back and forth with a very heavy guitar-driven passage twice until the song\r\nstarts. Quite heavy and string-heavy. I really believe the strings help make the\r\nmusic heavier. After the chorus plays, you realize that it is also not following the\r\nstandard song structure. Suddently, you get a unison riff with 3 guitars and strings\r\nunder the rhythm of the introduction until a new heavy riff leads the song for a few\r\nseconds and you get another new section that sounds like the first verse, but the\r\nrhythm is somewhat different. Instead of a chorus, you get the intro theme again,\r\ninterrupted by another guitar-driven section which contains a virtuosic guitar solo\r\nand eventually the chorus hits again and the song ends with the theme played at the\r\nbeginning. A masterpiece of metal for sure!<p>I recommend this album for metalheads and proggers alike, It is very intelligent\r\nmetal that doesnt' sacrifice the power and energy for prog.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106484#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106484\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=106484\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, January 8, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #106484)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter a definitely brilliant album which featured the return of their legendary front man Bruce Dickinson, Iron Maiden waited three \r\nyears to release the successor to BRAVE NEW WORLD. <p>DANCE OF DEATH, Maiden's 13th album, marked somewhat of a return to ancient formulas. Even though I said that about the \r\npreceding album, that actually holds much more true in the case of this record. The Beast still maintains a lot of progressive \r\nelements in their music, but, overall, there's a sensation of \"going-back\", there's a smell that reeks of early 80's and a lost era. <p>The playing is brilliant as always but the music is not as inspired. There are a few good songs in this album but most of them seem \r\nlike fillers, which is something that hadn't happened since the days of FEAR OF THE DARK. Let's talk a little bit about the songs: <p> Wildest Dreams (7/10) Nicko McBrain opens this track counting loud (with a weird old-man voice) before the whole band attacks \r\nwith power. The usual fast Maiden opener, the chorus is not as inspired and we can say that this is not the best first song an \r\nalbum by The Beast has ever seen. Good, enjoyable, but the singing is just a little bland. <p> Rainmaker (8.5/10) It's quite unusual that two fast, short tracks start a Maiden album. This one is much better than the \r\npreceding song and should've been the opener, the chorus being much more memorable and the music itself better. Not a \r\nmasterpiece of any kind but almost up to par with older, legendary fast tracks by the Irons. <p> No More Lies (8/10) The soft, quiet opening by guitars and bass brings us back to the good territories of the three preceding \r\nalbums. After the good first section (with inspired singing), the song gets faster,  though the chorus is more like a declaration of \r\nprinciples, a protest. Good guitar melodies abound. Good song. <p> Monts\u00e9gur (7/10) Suddenly we go back almost 20 years to the time when Maiden was releasing POWERSLAVE. The typical \r\nrelentless Maiden rhythm, the chorus is so retro-Maiden, even Dickinson sounds 15 years younger. Good song but not great. <p> Dance of Death (8/10) A slow start with good singing by Dickinson opens the title track. The texturing work by the guitars is \r\nremarkable. Halfway down we get an awkward section with synth helping the guitars set a weird mood, mix of ancient ballroom \r\nand heroic Maiden cavalry; the solos and melodies are good, but there's not a catch, a great chorus or a really fantastic tune, \r\nand that's a way to describe the album in a few words: tune-less, not completely of course (we're talking Maiden here) but \r\nnowehere near the level of the previous releases. Good, very good epic, but not excellent.  <p> Gates of Tomorrow (9/10) The opening riff reminds us of \"Lord of The Flies\" in the masterpiece THE X FACTOR; the verse is quite \r\ngood, with Dickinson -doubled- singing over a similar guitar melody. The chorus, in classical heroic Maiden rhythm, is one of the \r\nfirst very good ones in the album. The song is great, the best so far, even though at times it also sounds retro. <p> New Frontier (8.5/10) Lack of balance as this track opens just as the last one ended. The verse sounds like straight from THE \r\nNUMBER OF THE BEAST era. The pre-chorus and the chorus sound much more contemporary, though, more in power-metal vein \r\n(with touches of Queensryche). Another good fast song, the last two have been the best since we started this journey. <p> Paschendale (7.5/10) Now this track starts nothing like Maiden. While McBrain marks the rhythm with soft touches of hi-hat, \r\nDickinson sings over a high guitar and descending bass. Then the song travels varied territories, with descent melodies, sounding \r\nvery retro at times, but not one great hook, nothing spectacular. The short-epics in DANCE OF DEATH have disappointed so far; \r\nthey're good tracks, but nothing like other great anthems by The Beast. <p> Face in the Sand (7.5/10) A triple rhythm that almost sounds like a metallic waltz opens this song. It starts to get better with \r\ngreat bass and help from synths, which make this feel like the more progressive moment up to this point. Some double bass by \r\nMcBrain leads to way towards the unusual verse by Maiden. The song as a whole is unusual as the double-bass drum dominates \r\nthe music. After a great start, the song kind of gets lost in mediocre melodies and uninspired singing by Dickinson. Enjoyable, \r\ncould've been fantastic. <p> Age of Innocence (7/10) Queensryche strikes back (as we've said already, that band was so influenced by Maiden that we can \r\nonly talk of a full-circle here). A good enjoyable song but nothing that stands out from other Maiden tracks. Lacks a good melody. \r\nNear the end of the chorus it almost gets cheesy (?!?). <p> Journeyman (6.5/10) Acoustic guitar opens this last song in good fashion. Many songs in this album have started so well, only to \r\nget lost in nonsense. A very slow track, at times feels \"poppy\" (?!?), it's just not good. A weak closer.   <p> All in all, a step backwards (and a HUGE step at that) from BRAVE NEW WORLD. This albums seems like the \"great starts\" album, \r\nwhere many songs had excellent beginnings but the band didn't know how to actually make something good out of them. As it \r\ncontains mostly good songs anyway, it gets 3 stars, as it's superior to Maiden's weakest albums (NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING \r\nand PEACE OF MIND), but the right rating would be 2.75. The lack of melody is astounding, specially for a band that had \r\nmanaged the difficult task of writing very tuneful music while still being a metal group first and foremost. <p> Recommended for: Iron Maiden fans and collectors, fans of good metal who don't mind lack of great melodies or originality.<p>. yes, it's like Iron Maiden were finally copying themselves. After three great releases, it was time for calming down The Beast.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=128047#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=128047\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=128047\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, July 10, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #128047)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAnother solid release from the 'new' Maiden, one which might actually be there heaviest yet.  \"Dance of Death\" rumbles with a very \r\nraw and deep sound courtesy the rhythm section which lays down a dark backdrop to the three guitar's excellent riffing, all of which \r\nare recorded with a somewhat coarse quality.  As a whole the songs are quite good, featuring songs mostly relating to Bruce's \r\ninterest in history/war and giving the band plenty of chances to shine-- experimenting with composition and new ways to utilize their \r\ninstrumentation.  The listener can expect to hear plenty of smart solos and get their fists pumping to the melodies... and maybe \r\neven feel a few tingles from the really dramatic moments.

Still, this album doesn't start as brilliantly as their best ones. <p>\"No More Lies\" is interesting in the sense that it mixes slow parts with wild ones (as the band often does with longer pieces). But it is \r\nvery much predictable. Guitars sound really great and an extreme power is developed. The first song worth of interest \r\nis \"Montsegur\" although it is on the heavy end.<p>One has to say that there is some kind of routine now in their offering. Of course the impact of the three guitar players is impressive \r\nand should please any metal lover. Compositions are still well polished, appealing but if you except some of them like \"Dance Of The \r\nDead\", the all mighty \"Paschendale\" there are no so many highlights as one could expect.<p>Dynamics and power are of course on the list (\"Gates Of Tomorrow\" or the wild \"New Frontier\") but this album features too little \r\ngreat songs and it closes as it opened : rather weakly. Maiden produced so many better songs than \"Age Of Innocence\" \r\nand \"Journeyman\". Just fillers IMO. But for different reasons. While the first one is a dull metal song, the later is a dull rock ballad.<p>I guess that very few people discovered Maiden thanks to this album. There are probably more than ten better ones before getting  \r\ninterested in \"Dance Of Death\". I would rate it on the low three stars edge. Don't try to find any progressiveness either here. You \r\nwould just waste your time. But if you're looking for pure heavy metal, you are well on the good track.<p>This album also suffers from its length. Of course, the standards are to longer albums now, but almost seventy minutes is a bit too \r\nmuch when creativity is lacking.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156559#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156559\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=156559\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 25, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #156559)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI find joy in having a combined listening of heavy side of music and the light side as what I\r\nexperience today having enjoyed Gandalf and Steve Hackett, I continued playing The SIGIT (excellent\r\nIndonesian classic rock band) and now I am playing Iron Maiden \"Dance of Death\". What a perfect\r\ncombination! Having enjoyed peaceful stream of music delivered by Gandalf & Hackett, I switched\r\nright away to The SIGIT which has upbeat classic rock style and then the energetic music of Iron\r\nMaiden! It's cool man .!<p>As I have mentioned somewhere in my reviews at this site, I love Iron Maiden \"Brave new World\"\r\nalbum. By the time I made that statement I did not (yet) take into consideration of this \"Dance of\r\nDeath\" because I rarely played the CD due to its \"Copy Controlled\" technology that made sound\r\nquality is terrible. It's useless, actually, that this album has Kevin Shirley as producer because\r\nthe \"Copy Controlled\" thing has definitely destroyed the listening pleasure. I personally hate CD\r\nwith \"Copy Controlled\" technology because the sound quality is terrible. So is the case with this\r\nalbum which has that technology. I think, music lovers all over the world MUST FIGHT against the use\r\nof \"Copy Controlled\" technology which kills music. I mean it.<p>Let' put aside the sound quality and focus on the music. I find this album is an excellent one even\r\nthough in general I prefer \"Brave New World\" album. With triple guitar, this band ends up with\r\nsix-piece band. Actually I do not know why the band decided to use triple guitars as the band line\r\nup because basically I (and probably other listeners) can not differentiate who play which part and\r\nhard to find all three guitars play together at the same time. If it's just two guitars, at least I\r\ncan differentiate the sounds of rhythm section and the guitar melody. So, making the band with three\r\nplayers: Janick Gers, Dave Murray, and Adrian Smith is kind like waste. Two guitars are enough,\r\nactually.<p>The first two opening tracks \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Rainmaker\" are straight hard rock music in terms\r\nof style. These opening tracks are suitable being positioned as opening the album. With \"No More\r\nlies\" the band brings the \"Brave New World\" style into the music. I like the intro part which\r\nshowcases Steve Harris bass lines in ambient mode. \"Monstegur\" makes the album more powerful\r\nespecially through the combination of string section, groove and guitar solo. My favorite track is\r\nthe album title track \"Dance of Death\" which has similar nuance with \"Brave New World\" album. I like\r\nthe way the music flows in melodic way starting with an ambient style where string section as well\r\nas bass guitar work make major contribution to the music and the music flows beautifully in rock\r\nstyle with powerful Bruce Dickinson vocal. This song is also solid in terms of lyrics. \"Paschendale\"\r\nis also an excellent track. This song has varied styles and nice musical break followed with string\r\nsection which sounds like a symphonic music. The guitar solo is also stunning.<p>Overall, I consider this album is an excellent rock music with good melody, tight composition. Fans\r\nof Iron Maiden must have this album. <strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=165749#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=165749\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=165749\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 5, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #165749)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10195\"><strong>Queen By-Tor</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10195\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10195/reefer-madness1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>Far beyond the new Frontier</B><p>Yes, Iron Maiden is back as a different beast! Well, not entirely, as you may recognize this\r\nparticular formation of the band form their previous album <I>Brave New World</I>, but as masterful\r\nas that album was it seems that they've equaled (or perhaps topped?) themselves with this next\r\noutput. While some have criticized the band for staying to a formula on their more recent releases\r\nit seems to be for one reason: it works!<p>Short and long songs mixed to give the audience a lot of material to like make this album worth many\r\nrepeated listens. Heavy and short rockers like the opener <B>Wildest Dreams</B> and the stellar\r\nsingle <B>Rainmaker</B> with its absolutely wonderful triple guitar attack let the heads band and\r\nroll while more meditated (and almost progressive) story telling tracks like <B>No More Lies</B>,\r\n<B>Dance of Death</B> and <B>Paschendale</B> allow the band to showcase a more complex side of their\r\nmusic, also proving once more that the addition of a third guitar (or rather, not firing Gers when\r\nSmith returned from his absence) was something that really helped the band find a sound.<p>All in all the album has a very fantasy-esque feel, and this is what Maiden has always excelled at.\r\nWhile <I>Brave New World</I> toyed (heavily) with this idea, <I>Dance of Death</I> takes the concept\r\nby the horns and rides it to no end. Creepy story telling so familiar to the band's classic era has\r\nreturned as evident in the album's title track which opens slowly with some smooth guitar playing\r\nbefore giving away to some heavy and very well done parts later. The stories aren't too overblown as\r\nwell so they're not difficult to keep up with which really helps the album.<p>If one was forced to pick the standouts of the album, they would have to be the war-torn story\r\n<B>Paschendale</B> which shows Maiden at their story-telling zenith (and they'll pick up on this\r\ntheme again with their next album) as they revisit a topic they've done so often in songs like\r\n<I>The Trooper</I> and <I>Die With Your Boots On</I> except with a better side of harsh reality that\r\nkeeps the audience grounded to Earth if only for the duration of the song. The extremely emotional\r\nperformance on <B>Journeyman</B> is also very well worth noting as Bruce showcases the magnitude of\r\nhis voice in a song that was clearly built for it. <B> Face in the Sand</B> with its creepy,\r\nforeboding lyrics is another giant standout in the Maiden cannon - another song that shows\r\nincredible maturity from the band.<p>Of the other shorter songs on the album most (if not all) are geared towards the metal head. Prog\r\nfans may not find much to like in songs like <B>Montsegur</B> (although its controversial lyrics may\r\nwell provide a thought-provoking experience) or <B>Gates Of Tomorrow</B> which are very good\r\nsymph-metal compositions but not great prog. However, if there's a metal head anywhere in you then\r\nyou will be blown away by their bombastic delivery on these tracks.<p>Finally, a note about the sleeve art. It's bad. Really bad. However, don't let it fool you (actually\r\nthere's some really cool photography on the inside of the booklet which makes one wonder why they\r\ndidn't use a style more like that), because this album is fantastic and arguably one of Maiden's best.<p>This is a fine addition to any prog library with many progressive moments to keep any one who likes\r\ntheir prog heavy interested. I award 4 stars to this fine disc.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=167229#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=167229\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=167229\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, April 15, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #167229)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nNot as good as the masterful \"Brave New World\" in my opinion, but there's little to complain about \r\nhere. The cover art though is probably the worst i've seen for a MAIDEN album. The music here is far from bad though, in fact the rhythm section \r\nespecially shines here with some thundering groundwork.<p>\r\n\"Wildest Dreams\" is my least favourite track even though it's a good little rocker. Some ripping guitar \r\nbefore 2 1/2 minutes. I like when it settles right after the solo. \"Rainmaker\" and the rest of the songs \r\nare pretty incredible.This is classic MAIDEN with that uptempo rhythm and Bruce singing his heart out. Nice \r\nguitar solo after 2 minutes. \"No More Lies\" opens with that familiar sounding guitar which is done so \r\ntastefully here. Reserved vocals after a minute. It kicks in on the chorus before 2 1/2 minutes, then the \r\ntempo picks up. Bruce stops singing before 4 minutes as we get an instrumental assault for 2 minutes. It \r\nends as it began. \"Montsegur\" features killer bass lines from Harris as Nicko pounds away. Love the \r\nvocals a minute in which are so passionate and powerful. This one cooks ! <p>\"Dance Of Death\" is my \r\nfavourite as we hear this story which begins in a laid back manner. Before 3 minutes the vocals rise up \r\nand the music kicks in and starts to gallop 3 1/2 minutes in.The guitars are ripping it up before 5 \r\nminutes. Great sound 8 minutes in when it calms down. \"Gates Of Tomorrow\" opens with some wild \r\nsounding guitar as heavy bass and drums join in. A full sound a minute in and vocals follow. Scorching \r\nguitar before 3 1/2 minutes. \"New Frontier\" is a hard hitting tune and I love the guitar after 3 minutes \r\nas he lights it up. Great song ! \"Paschendale\" is another classic MAIDEN track with the reserved vocals \r\nand mellow sound that are interupted by explosions of sound until it stays kicked in before 1 1/2 \r\nminutes. Check out the guitar before 5 minutes ! It's very powerful 6 1/2 minutes in. It ends as it \r\nbegan.<p> \"Face In The Sand\" builds until we get some ground shaking bass. Vocals 2 minutes in. Blistering \r\nguitar after 4 1/2 minutes. \"Age Of Innocence\" features this gorgeous intro as vocals come in.It kicks in \r\naround a minute. Nice heavy rhythm here with some monster bass from Harris. \"Journeyman\" is \r\nperhaps the most interesting track because it doesn't sound like them, it's pretty light with orchestral \r\nsounds. It sounds better 2 minutes on the chorus.<p>\r\nProbably would have been close to 5 stars if the first and last song were omitted. Again it's hard to \r\nreally complain about this album, it's incredible !\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=201180#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=201180\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=201180\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, January 30, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #201180)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Iron Maiden by the numbers</strong><p>After the very impressive Brave New World came the disappointing Dance Of Death. It is \r\nstill a good album that holds up reasonably well compared to <em>some</em> earlier \r\nalbums, but it pales in comparison with most of the band's classic 80's albums and \r\nthe excellent Brave New World. While listening to this album I often get the feeling that I've \r\nheard it all before. It sounds a bit formulaic and archetypal. The first song has a raw, almost garage type sound to it. This is emphasised by the spoken 1-2-3-introduction.<p>Dance Of Death is pretty much Iron Maiden by the numbers. Rainmaker is a much better song with a stronger melody and a much better sound. It is almost as if the different tracks were given different production. No More Lies sounds like something we have heard before. The title-track sounds lyrically and musically naive and somehow lacks substance.<p>The songs on Dance Of Death are generally shorter than those on the previous album, but \r\nthey often run out of steam before they are through. It is also the case that this album often \r\nsounds rushed, underdeveloped and the production is sometimes muddled. It is certainly not of the sonic quality of Brave New World or Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. <p>Dance Of Death is also significantly less progressive and more straightforward compared \r\nto the very progressive Brave New World. Paschendale is the only truly progressive song \r\nhere. But it certainly would not have been good enough to fit in on Brave New World.<p>Face In The Sand is significantly heavier than the other tracks which adds a nice diversity, \r\nbut the melody is basically the same as on Blood Brothers from Brave New World (not the \r\nchorus). <p>Journeyman is an acoustic song with strings, which is very unusual and surprising for this \r\nband. This might also be the best song from Dance Of Death. But, again, the melody \r\nsounds familiar somehow and while it is clearly something new within the context of this \r\ngroup it is certainly nothing adventurous in a general sense. <p>Good, but not more than just that.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=218925#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=218925\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=218925\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, May 29, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #218925)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>Dance of Death</em> is the fourteenth full-length studio album and the second by British \r\nheavy metal act <B>Iron Maiden</B> after lead vocalist <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> and \r\nguitarist <B>Adrian Smith</B> returned to the fold. Their previous album <em>Brave New \r\nWorld (2000)</em> saw <B>Iron Maiden</B> regaining some of the ground they had lost in \r\nthe years with lead vocalist <B>Blaze Bayley</B> and the two below average releases \r\n<em>The X-Factor (1995)</em> and <em>Virtual X (1998)</em>. Best examplified by the fact that \r\nwhen they played ( my country) Denmark on the Fear Of The Dark tour in 1992,  which was \r\nthe last tour with <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> before he left the group, they played to a sold out \r\nvenue called Valby Hallen, Copenhagen where the capacity is 5000 people. \r\nOn the tour for <em>Virtual X</em> in 1998 they played to a capacity crowd of 1500 people at a \r\nvenue called Vega in Copenhagen. Now that\u00b4s a significant decrease in popularity.<p>A re-vitalized band now with three guitarists conquered the world once again on the tour for \r\n<em>Brave New World</em>. It all seemed like a new beginning for the band. <p><em>Dance of Death</em> follows down much the same path as it\u00b4s predecessor. A few fast \r\nheavy metal tracks and most of the rest are epic slow to mid-paced heavy metal songs. \r\nThis is what we expect from <B>Iron Maiden</B> and I\u00b4m sure no one would like it any \r\ndifferent. So when the style is basically the same as always it\u00b4s of course the quality of the \r\ncompositions, the production and the musicianship that\u00b4s of interest. <p>The compositions are generally some of the better <B>Iron Maiden</B> have done since \r\n<em>Seventh Son of A Seventh Son (1988)</em> and there\u00b4s actually a kind of retro-feel in \r\nsome of the songs that I greatly enjoy. All songs are above average but a few stand out IMO. \r\n<em>Monts\u00e9gur</em> is simply one of the heaviest <B>Iron Maiden</B> songs I have ever \r\nheard. Just listen to the beginning of that song. Pure heavy metal joy. The title track is also \r\nworth a mention for the frantic and quite folky riff in the middle. I enjoy that very much. But \r\n<em>Paschendale</em> is without a doubt my favorite here. It\u00b4s such a dark and epic song yet \r\nnever losing it\u00b4s heavy edge.<p>The musicianship is outstanding as ever. Lots of great and melodic guitar soloes, the most \r\nheavy sounding rythm section in a while and <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> in fine form. What \r\nmore can you ask for?<p>The production is excellent. Maybe the heaviest production ever on an <B>Iron Maiden</B> \r\nalbum. It\u00b4s perfect in my world.<p><em>Dance of Death</em> is a brilliant album by <B>Iron Maiden</B> and one all fans need in \r\ntheir collection. The epic atmosphere in some of the songs might attract a few progressive \r\nmetal fans too but remember that <B>Iron Maiden</B> is first and foremost heavy metal. \r\nUp the Irons! And a fully deserved 4 star rating.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=232222#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=232222\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=232222\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, August 18, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #232222)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden - Dance of Death (2003)<p>I liked the gathering of Maiden's best musicians during the Brave New World period and \r\nexpectations were high at the time of the release of this album. Dance of Death is a good \r\nalbum, but some new problems appeared when Maiden tried to enter the world of 'modern' \r\nmetal recordings and digital artwork. The latter is by far the worst released since the \r\nexistence of the band. The recording is very bad, with annoying drum-sounds and an \r\nunfinished sound as if it was recorded in a rush. Producing their own album is one of the \r\nfew talents Iron Maiden clearly does not have. Furthermore the length of the album, also a \r\nmodern feature, makes the second phase of it uninteresting at times.<p>Having that said, there are also some very good features on this new Iron Maiden album. \r\nFirst of all, there are some very innovative and progressive songs here! Monts\u00e9gur shows \r\nIron Maiden doing something totally different with a sometimes folky approach and cynical \r\nlyrics about slaughter for faith. \r\nDance of Death, the title-track uses some world-music influences and has an elegant style. \r\nThe epical structure, the beautiful acoustic guitars in the beginning and the amazing metal-\r\nparts in the middle section make this a fresh Maiden epic. \r\nPaschendale is an epic with a modern punchy riff, a sensitive intro and some nice \r\nsymphonic elements. The bombastic moments of the song are great an the lyrics about this \r\nhistorical battle are intensive. The song is a bit fragmentarily in the beginning, but \r\nprogresses quite a lot and has a lot to offer. \r\nJourneyman is an entirely acoustic song with an adventurous sound and good vocals by \r\nDickinson. This is the sensitive side of Iron Maiden and their second entirely rock-less track \r\nof their career, with Strange world from their debut being the first. Some slightly symphonic \r\nsounds make the song work very well, though it's a bit too long. Great track and a very \r\noriginal approach. <p>The other tracks all have good elements but aren't as good as those I've just mentioned. \r\nWildest dream is a happy opener and Rainmaker an emotional song that could have been \r\nrecorded way better. No More Lies is my least favorite part of the album because it's to \r\nsimple and recycles way to much of their earlier tracks. Gates of Tomorrow, New Frontier, \r\nFace in the Sand and Age of Innocence are acceptable metal-track with often some catchy \r\nparts, but a bit un-asked for IMHO. Not everything to original here. <p>Conclusion. This is an Iron Maiden album with some very interesting progressions and \r\nsome great ideas. To bad the recording isn't good enough (for the first time in their career..). \r\nThe album is to long and three songs should have been excluded. This album has at least \r\n45 minutes of great material! This album is recommended to fans of the band and metal-\r\nfans in general. Proggers who aren't audiophiles will also find some very nice progress \r\nhere and a fine album of one of the best bands of the world. Three stars, good but not \r\nessential. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284564#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284564\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284564\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 2, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284564)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=22970\"><strong>Conor Fynes</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=22970\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/22970/30451_10150198165215024_781110023_13173148_4731438_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> 'Dance Of Death' - Iron Maiden (7/10) </strong><p>'Dance Of Death' marks the second chapter in Iron Maiden's six-piece lineup. Although \r\nchanges within the ranks and the addition of a third guitarist would normally be something \r\nonly fans would be interested in, it did mark a musical shift for the band. Starting with 'Brave \r\nNew World'- an album that's been since considered one of the greatest metal albums of the \r\nnew millennium- Iron Maiden brought their distinctive style back to the forefront, and haven't \r\nlooked back since. Most notably, singer Bruce Dickinson was back with them, but there is \r\nalso a progressive edge to the songwriting that makes this period in Iron Maiden's history \r\narguably their most exciting. 'Dance Of Death' balances out between their classic style and \r\nmore intricate composition, and despite the relatively weak album art, Maiden makes it clear \r\nthat they are far from exhausting their artistic spirit.<p>There will certainly be those who argue that Iron Maiden have 'barely' changed their sound \r\nover the decades, but comparing their early, punk-infused energy to the symphonic \r\ngrandeur of the title track on 'Death Of Death', it's undeniable that Iron Maiden have picked \r\nup some new tricks. Perhaps moreso than 'Brave New World', Iron Maiden balances two \r\ndistinct approaches on this album. The first is their classic brand of songwriting, one that \r\noften uses the signature 'guitar gallop', biting solos and choruses that could get a stadium's \r\nworth of metalheads singing along. 'Rainmaker' stands out particularly in this regard, with a \r\nfuturistic main riff and pleasant vocal leads from Dickinson. 'Montsegur' is arguably the \r\nmost traditional Maiden track here, a song somewhat reminiscent of 'The Trooper' that \r\ncould have snuck onto an earlier Maiden album without arousing much suspicion. <p>As many of Maiden's fans might agree however, the highlight of Iron Maiden's recent work \r\nlies in the 'epic' songs they have been focusing on. Although they flirted with longer song \r\nstructures as far back as their debut album, 'Dance Of Death' truly indicates their recent \r\npreference for involving, progressive composition. Without the slightest doubt, the two \r\nhighlights on 'Dance Of Death' are the occult-themed title track, and the cinematic \r\n'Paschendale'. The first of these sees Iron Maiden going down a familiar route of \r\nstorytelling, about a man abducted and taken to an undead ritual. 'Paschendale' is a tribute \r\nto the eponymous battle in WWI, attempting to give the same sense of grim reality that 'The \r\nTrooper' gave the Crimean War. Musically, both tracks represent some of the most powerful \r\nsongwriting I've ever heard Iron Maiden do, opening gracefully, and dramatically building to \r\nsomething powerful and even symphonic. As has become the standard for Maiden, the \r\nlyrics are handled with sophistication, generally falling upon history or philosophy for \r\ninspiration.<p>'Dance Of Death's weakness comes in the form of songs that come close to being called \r\n'filler'. 'No More Lies', 'Gates Of Tomorrow' and 'New Frontier' are all pleasant enough \r\nMaiden tracks, but even after giving 'Dance Of Death' many enjoyed listens, I found nothing \r\nstirring about them.

With much praise heaped upon that \r\ntriumphant return to Maiden-hood, the band had much to live up to. It only makes sense that the classic 80's line \r\nup plus one Janick Gers sharing lead guitar duties with the Smith and Dave Murray would attempt to move ahead. \r\nThe album sees a few firsts, including the first song-writing credit for drummer Nicko McBrain (\"New Frontier\"), the \r\nfirst album where all band members receive song-writing credits, and the first fully-acoustic Iron Maiden song \r\n(\"Journeyman\"). It could also be considered to be the first Iron Maiden album to have such hideous artwork that the \r\nartist himself allegedly asked not to have his name associated with it. According to the Wiki article on the album, \r\nartist David Patchett was not pleased when the band opted to use the unfinished version of his computer-\r\ngenerated artwork. Indeed, when I saw it up close I thought it looked like amateur video game artwork. A further \r\nnote to mention is that the album was recorded on analogue tape.<p><p>Stylistically, the music maintains the traditional sound of Iron Maiden, the one that I feel was established with \r\n\"Piece of Mind\" and altered only with subtle variations over the next three albums, most notably the addition of \r\nsynthesizers on \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". The synthesizers remain but are used in complement with the \r\nheavy guitar sound, creating a symphonic sound at times. Aside from the \"fully all-acoustic\" track \"Journeyman\", \r\nthere are some other tracks that include acoustic guitar in parts, typically in the intro. There are the usual \r\nwonderful Maiden chugging riffs, more progressive instrumental sections, and outstanding guitar solos. Someone \r\nonce mentioned Maiden's propensity to go almost \"Celtic\" and that certainly shows itself, most notably here on the \r\ntitle track, more than usual.<p><p>Song topics remain largely with the historical, socio-political, religious and science fiction, and the title track's lyrics \r\nseem to revisit \"The Number of the Beast\" as Dickenson sings about being out one night and encountering a \r\nstrange scene. \"Montsegur\" is of particular interest to me as I read and have on my bookshelf a book about \r\nMontsegur and the Cathars. Dickenson still belts out the notes and holds some decent operatic hollers.<p><p>For perhaps most people, this album doesn't receive the same degree of praise as \"Brave New World\"; however, I \r\nthink it makes for an excellent. Together the two albums make a great pair, the blue and the red as it were, \r\nconsidering the dominant colours of each album cover.<p><p>For me, one of the attractions to this album is the progressive side. The first two songs are short rockers, but \r\nseveral others take time to stretch out over six minutes, and you know that's when Iron Maiden really stretch \r\nout their composition-writing wings. \"Paschedale\" is my favourite and has a symphonic quality about it at times. \r\nThe title track is also interesting for its \"dance of death\" riff. \"Montsegur\" has a terrific heavy riff and as a Maiden \r\nhistorical piece, you know there's going to be some great developments in the music. \"Face in the Sand\" blends \r\nsynthesizer and another almost folk-inspired guitar riff at the intro. The chorus melody to \"Age of Innocence\" is one \r\nof those catchy Maiden choruses that crop up from time to time like on \"Can I Play with Madness\" from \"Seventh \r\nSon\".<p><p>When I tried to make a selection of \"best songs\" from the five most recent albums (2000 to 2015), \"Dance of Death\" \r\nshared the highest number of selected songs with \"Brave New World\". Highly recommended as a companion to \r\n\"Brave New World\" or simply on its own.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1484710#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1484710\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1484710\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, November 10, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12941#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1484710)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the above quote is a terrible cliche, as book cover artwork (or in this case album art) should reflect what's inside, there's a great deal of books and albums that come across as something else with what's shown on the front.
