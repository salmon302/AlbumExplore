creative collective that plays an absorbing style of modern progressive music they call 'cinematic rock'. Across their debut work, ''A Dream In Static'', the seasoned group displays a wild stylistic diversity and creative hunger that jams the mental machinery of comparison. Through organic layers of living, breathing orchestra (courtesy of the Moscow Studio Symphony Orchestra), and an eclectic arsenal of world music-influenced instrumentation, EARTHSIDE fashions an ever-changing sound that is equally engrossing alongside a work of cinematic art as it is resonating throughout a densely packed concert venue. ''A Dream In Static'', the group's conceptual mission statement, is a story of purposeful sacrifice and existential yearning told across sweeping instrumental movements, interwoven with adventurous vocal compositions featuring guest performances from premier voices across the rock and metal worlds. The inherently collaborative cross-continental project was recorded in Stockholm, Sweden under the watch of renowned producer and mix engineer David Castillo (OPETH, KATATONIA, BLOODBATH) and additional mix and mastering engineer Jens Bogren (OPETH, SOILWORK, THE OCEAN, DEVIN TOWNSEND).<br><br>EARTHSIDE are:<br><br>Ben SHANBROM (Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals), Frank SACRAMONE (Grand Piano, Keyboards, Programming), Ryan GRIFFIN (Bass), Jamie van DYCK (Electric and Acoustic Guitars, Orchestration, Backing Vocals)<br><br>Biography adopted from the band's website - edited by aapatsos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:left;padding:0px;margin:10px 0px 10px 0px;\">\r\n<!-- ads here-->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"buymusic\" id=\"buymusic\"></a>\r\n<h2>Buy EARTHSIDE Music &nbsp;

recently made the abrupt decision to get back into Metal. I knew it was going to happen eventually, just because I \r\nhave a lot of Metal and related albums to review yet. It just sort of dawned on me though that I didn't want to leave \r\nthem all to the end(yes there is an end in sight for my reviews) so starting last week I'm back in the saddle again. And I \r\nchose the debut from this New England quartet that is known as EARTHSIDE. A band who is modern, even though this \r\nwas released ten years ago now. Lets just say to these ears this is modern as I have lost touch with this sub-genre. The \r\npost rock guitars, the orchestration, the cinematic soundscapes, and the djent influence are all here. <p>EARTHSIDE \r\nare very fortunate to have financial backing as well. I mean it allowed them to make the record that they wanted to \r\nmake without cutting corners or compromising. This album was marketed big time, plus they don't have a vocalist so \r\nthey brought in some known singers from this sub-genre like Daniel Tomkins from TESSERACT, Lajon Witherspoon \r\nfrom SEVENDUST plus two other vocalists. Kind of like what INDUKTI, AEON ZEN and LONG DISTANCE CALLING used \r\nto do, bringing in singers from other bands. And then they get Travis Smith to do the incredible cover art. And then \r\nthey get known producer David Castillo(KATATONIA, OPETH, RUSH etc.) to record and produce it. <p> So yes it seems \r\na little odd that a new band would have such pull, but money talks. The other part of this equation is that three of the \r\nfour members(minus the bass player) were in a band called BUSHWHACK that released an album back in 2007 that \r\ngets higher ratings on the RYM site than this one does. So we get eight tracks worth around 64 minutes. This band \r\ncontrasts sections really well. The repeated themes is something I like, and they also do that well. Those post rock styled \r\nguitars are front and centre on the 8 minute opener \"The Closest I've Come\". Contrasted with the heavier riff based \r\npassages. <p>The orchestration is heard first on that second song \"Mob Mentality\", where we get vocals for the first \r\ntime from the SEVENDUST dude. Some furious orchestral maneuvers after 4 minutes. And it's uplifting around 7 1/2 \r\nminutes. The TESSERACT singer is featured on the next song which is the title track. A proggy 7 1/2 minute tune. The \r\ncinematic soundscapes come to the fore on \"Entering The Light\" along with more orchestration. \"Skyline\" at 9 1/2 \r\nminutes might be my favourite along with the closer. Some beautiful sections on this one including piano. Those Post \r\nrock vibes are strong later on. <p> \"Crater\" is a great tune with some extreme vocals and heavy sound with the guitar \r\nsoloing away. \"The Ungrounding\" has some real heaviness to it before 2 minutes along with atmosphere. An intense \r\nyet gorgeous piece. Lastly \"Contemplation Of The Beautiful\" at almost 12 minutes ends it. This song stood out above \r\nthe rest after that first listen. Headphone music for sure. Vocals go from quiet to aggressive, just like the music. Check \r\nout the beauty of the strings after 10 minutes. This song really pushes this album well into 4 star territory for me.<p> \r\nI'm back Metal fans! Yes it's been a while but Metal related music is first love stuff in my world. My tastes have \r\nchanged though so this should be an interesting ride. I hope to review at least one Metal related album a week for the \r\nnext year plus.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3156372#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3156372\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3156372\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, February 24, 2025</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=51267#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3156372)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_3730101082023_r.jpg\" alt=\" Let the Truth Speak by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2023<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.36 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.36</span> | 93 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Let the Truth Speak</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=29276\"><strong>grosssover</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=29276\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/29276/mark.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nStop!! \r\nWell, this is a masterpiece!\r\nThis great album represents what modern metal music SHOULD sound .\r\nIf you keep up with the times, then you could say that this album is just that, a very modern metal journey that deserves the listener's very high attention.\r\nI'm not going to cover the song by song here, which I should, but only technical and the emotional value of the album, which hardly anyone does in reviews.\r\nI haven't followed this band that much lately, considering that they only have two albums and one single out. It is very likely that they composed and arranged the album over a longer period of time, very likely as TOOL did...\r\nIt could be said that the album was designed to be and to remain a masterpiece. Standard modern progressive metal does not goes in this direction like EARTHSIDE is going. There are very few bands that express themselves artistically with such excellent production and post production. I can mention several bands that are similar in conceptual musical sense. Tesseract, Haken, Deftones, Devin Townsend, Animals As Leaders, Sleep Token.\r\nThe album Let The Truth Speak itself is a very emotional album, both with playing and singing. Singers from the band and guest singers are giving homework to almost everyone who would like to have this kind of compositions in their hands. From pure R'N'B, Theatrical vocals and Emo-Djent, standard metal and spoken word also can be heard. The dynamics of the album itself is almost perfect and leads the listener to a darker emotional side with bright endings.I just love those kind of albums that have to be listened many times in order to understand what the poet wants to say. There are those little musical diversions on the album where funk-metal  and movie theatrical transitions can be heard. All of this leads the band to further expertise that music is not just riffology, instead , music is much, much complex and simple in the same time. \r\nI will stop here with the review in order not to exaggerate and to leave the listener to think about how the goal of a high musical  standards can be achieved today. I can recommend this album to all music researchers who would like to hear something conceptually new, with a high standard and unpretentious. 5/5 without a doubt.<p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3061194#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3061194\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3061194\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, June 21, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3061194)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_3730101082023_r.jpg\" alt=\" Let the Truth Speak by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2023<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.36 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.36</span> | 93 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Let the Truth Speak</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=6456\"><strong>uribreitman</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI've been listening to this album for months. It has haunted my mind and convinced me that Earthside has managed to win the title of \"Album of the year\" (2023). This album has a rare combination of super-imaginitive arrangements, breathtaking vocal performances (\"Tyranny\", \"Pattern of Rebirth\", \"Denial's Aria\"), exquisite instrumental work (\"Watching the world sink\") and the integration of both (\"We Who Lament\"). <p>Even compared with Earthside's amazing debut from 2015, this is still superior work. The variety of musical landscapes is overwhelming. This masterpiece is its own mini-world, and needs to be listened to many times until it is fully understood, absorbed and assimilated into your blood stream.<p>One of the most courageous tracks, \"The Lesser Evil\", features a horn section to its funk-djent arrangement, which is a very original choice, and produces an overall sound that is rare in the prog-rock genre. Special praise should be given to Ben Shanbrom for his sensitive and intelligent drumming skills. This doesn't mean that Jamie van Dyck's (guitars) name can be ignored, since his musical contributions to the end-product are numerous. <p>This symphonic mega-work, painstakingly produced and mixed, concludes with yet-another climax called \"All We Knew and Ever Loved\", which features some kind of church organ and has both a goth and a minimalist (soundtrack-ish) feel to it. The bombastic ending fits this once-in-a-year album, which is a huge achievement for the band, and also for the entire prog-rock genre in the 21st century.<p>In short, LTTS by Earthside is an essential masterwork for the year of 2023. Its generous duration (77 minutes) adds value to the package. Blessed are its (exhausted) creators and fortunate are its many new listeners, around the ever-expanding progressive universe.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3029694#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3029694\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3029694\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, March 13, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3029694)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_3730101082023_r.jpg\" alt=\" Let the Truth Speak by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2023<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.36 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.36</span> | 93 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Let the Truth Speak</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=71337\"><strong>alainPP</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=71337\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/hiro_bird2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n'But What If We're Wrong?' orchestral intro with vibraphone, dry percussion, distinct from the Sandbox Percussion \r\ngroup creating a strong and dark climate aided by guitar riffs; cinematic sound I understand; epic, aerial, the \r\nostinato recalls the tunes of Philip Glass, immense; halfway through Anathema latency before setting off on a \r\ncontemplative, enjoyable, orgasmic climb. 'We Who Lament' with Keturah with poignant vocals, an air surfing on a \r\nLeprous, nervous, fluid; innocent air, rambling, bewilderment on the question of living peacefully in a schizoid \r\nworld; a crescendo surfing on slowed down djent \u00e0 la Karnivool with the dreamlike final time/gone with this \r\npantagruelian bass. 'Tyranny' is a more massive tune with the riff, Pritam's death vocals which flow over modern \r\nrock then a metallic, hypnotic and intoxicating ballad; atmospheric break reminiscent of Katatonia, Tesseract, in an \r\nambient post-rock spirit with wild incursions and devastating riffs. 'Pattern of Rebirth' with Aj Channer for the djent \r\ntrack, heavy riff; nervous chorus, hip-hop, rap touch, musical explosion, nu-metal fusion, disconcerting. 'Watching \r\nthe Earth Sink' Oceansize isn't far away; acoustic airy guitar, Ben busying himself with his drums, post rise close to \r\nan epileptic seizure, a delirious burst; Ocean-style crescendo, atmospheric rock metal fusion for the oxymoron \r\ndelivering a gentle musical brutality to a thirsty finale.<p>'The Lesser Evil', confusing, meets an Earth, Wind & Fire, a Prince with this soul-jazzy side and the violence of a \r\nPeriphery, a Panzeballett; Larry sings accompanied by Sam on tenor sax for an unimaginable crossover ballad \r\nbetween explosion and fruity mixture. 'Denial's Aria' with Keturah on vocals and harps from Duo Scorpio, magical, \r\nrelaxing; sound on the soundtrack of 'Silent Hill' imbued with nostalgia; a melancholy ballad, musical, limpid water. \r\n'Vespers' atmospheric, dreamlike, angelic interlude; whispered Japanese voices, Earthside really goes far. 'Let the \r\nTruth Speak' follows with Daniel from Tesseract on a lyrical song, the sound changes, a surge of violins, sharp riffs, \r\nthe flowery djent is there; explosive piece with a gripping bass, shouted vocals, a break with Gennady chanting \r\nfrantically over choirs and strings before the finale in apotheosis. 'All We Knew and Ever Loved' instrumental to \r\nclose with Baard de Leprous on drums; an organ, a drum roll, Anathema's guitar, 'Interstellar' or 'Sunshine' in the \r\nbackground, it's all there; an orchestra to amplify the grandiloquent aspect, this latent ostinato air, the organ on 'Le \r\nbal des Laze', the memories flood in; the rush of musical adrenaline emerges with this battle of drummers, the \r\norgan becoming crazy, majestic, taking us beyond the stars, compressing us in our chair.<p>Earthside released an OMNI at the end of the year that you shouldn't forget; a gentle musical madness which \r\ndenotes in a latent world, filled with misery and despair, a divine breath to heal.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2987881#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2987881\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2987881\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, February 2, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2987881)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_3730101082023_r.jpg\" alt=\" Let the Truth Speak by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2023<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.36 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.36</span> | 93 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Let the Truth Speak</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=74387\"><strong>Dapper~Blueberries</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Prog Reviewer</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=74387\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/74387/1EFDCD0E-C552-49C4-821B-5BEFBAA10CA1.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI find that oftentimes metal music is usually just framed as something that is only just gritty and hard as nails, and \r\nwhile in most cases that is certainly true, I find that metal can certainly share moments of beauty and tranquility, \r\noftentimes in ways many might not see coming. I mean, certainly just this year we've had a couple of metal releases \r\nthat, while still heavy, contain a spark of sheer grace for me that I come back to, craving for more. Woe Unto Me \r\ngave a more doom metal answer to my cravings of splendiferous music, and Ne Obliviscaris followed that up with a \r\ngraciously amazing symphonic prog metal record. However, while those masterpieces of music certainly do deliver \r\nsuch a vibrant metal landscape, neither of which made me wish to see a more delicate outlook on the landscape as \r\nmuch as Earthside's latest release has.<p>Earthside is a relatively new group in the prog metal scene, being formed in 2014 in the New England region of the \r\nUS. Despite their newer status, and very limited release pool, they have certainly made a name for themselves as a \r\ntop dog in the newer sphere of prog metal, alongside Haken, Others By No One, and Caligula's Horse. What sets \r\nthem apart from their colleagues is their metal in particular having a lot more of an introspective edge that can be \r\nsimilar to that of post rock groups like The Evpatoria Report, or We Lost The Sea. Whilst their first release, A Dream \r\nin Static, certainly featured their more lush heavy metal sound, their sophomore record of Let The Truth Speak \r\nexpands on their post rock influences even more, whilst also showcasing an interesting way of bending certain \r\ngenres to their whim.<p>If there is one descriptor I would say this album is in most of its facets, I would say pastoral. Now, you might be \r\nasking, why that word? Most of the times when you describe something as pastoral in a prog context, you'd mostly \r\nlook at stuff in relation to the more folksy scene of groups like Strawbs or Gryphon. Well, I believe with how things \r\nare played about on this album, the term pastoral just fits right on home. The waves of beautiful symphonics mixed \r\nwith an uplifting sense of self fits almost perfectly with the more country side outlooks many bands from the 60s \r\nand 70s looked towards for musical ideals, though to a certainly modern degree. Everything within the album's \r\nseams feel so warm, cozy, and tranquil in a weird but uplifting way, even in the more heavy moments this record \r\nshows often. I know, it is quite odd to call a heavy metal album 'cozy', but the music has a particular warmth to me \r\nthat I never knew I craved in a record, almost as if it is a hug in musical form.<p>As for the sound itself in a more direct musical opinion, this is easily one of the best metal releases this year. Jamie \r\nVan Dyck's guitar soars in ways that makes it feel so otherworldly, with Ben Shanbrom's drums leading the pack \r\nwith lines that have an intensity of a raging bull, but the comfort and loving embrace that of a mother. Frank \r\nSacramone and Ryan Griffin also provide excellence here, with both allowing the textures to flourish that makes \r\ntheir efforts all the more commendable. Still, I believe the main focus is certainly the guest musicians that are on \r\nmost of the tracks. Almost every track features at least one or two guest stars, usually with helping hands on vocals, \r\norchestration, or sometimes to provide more instrumentation to the playing. However, this isn't like, say, Humanz \r\nby Gorillaz, where the guest stars are practically the musicians with the band being a mere backup. No, in fact this \r\nfeels more like a communal effort, with both band and guests working together as one unit in these songs, at least \r\nhow I see it. Look at The Lesser Evil for example, featuring Larry Braggs of soul groups Temptations & Tower of \r\nPower, as well as experimental jazzist Sam Gendel of Clown Core. Whilst certainly both play a large role in the \r\nsound of the song, I never felt both overpowered one another, or even overpowered Earthside in their efforts. In \r\nfact, it feels more like they bounce off each other with a highly enjoyable mix of things. Earthside obviously provide \r\nthe more heavy metal sound, almost in a djent type of way, with Sam Gendel providing an amazing funky jazz that \r\nbreathes a magical life in the mix, and Larry Braggs providing a soul / funk vocal setting, making this interesting \r\nfusion not only sound more pure, but filled with heart. Your attention is never on one particular thing here, only on \r\nthe music, and as such these collaborations certainly feel just that, collaborations, work between musician and \r\nmusician in order to make the art better than ever. Larry, Sam, and everyone else here aren't just featured on an \r\nEarthside record, they practically ARE members of Earthside here, and I think that is just beautiful.<p>Speaking of mixes of genres, I do not think I have ever heard a metal album so eclectic, aside from the Omnerod \r\nrecord I reviewed last week. I mean I already talked about the jazz funk mix of The Lesser Evil, but coming off that \r\nwe get Denial's Aria, a strictly non-metal, ambient art pop track (and my favorite track on this album personally). I \r\nmean, having such a soft track after a wave of interesting, dramatic, and very vibrant metal workings seems like a \r\nrecipe to absolutely break the flow of the album, and while it may certainly be unexpected, with just how it is \r\norchestrated with a mix of beautiful symphonic qualities, atmosphere, and a sense of tension building, especially \r\nwith the beautiful vocal workings of VikKe and Duo Scorpio's harp, it all comes together and creates probably one of \r\nthe best scores in the band's catalog. This record is kinda like Omnerod's The Amensal Rise, but while that album \r\nwas more so genres being mixed through the seams of a multitude of heavy, avant-metal workings, Let The Truth \r\nSpeak is a clear and direct fusion between the genres Earthside is fascinated by. Obviously I mentioned elements of \r\njazz, post rock, and pop here, but you also get elements of R&B, romanticism, soul, folk, and just a lot more that I \r\nfind myself surprised with each listen, finding new things under every note. It is honestly quite amazing how they \r\nmanaged to just find a way to bend prog metal in ways that are totally unexpected, but totally rewarding all the \r\nsame.<p>Though, I will say this record's only problem is that the second half is a lot more interesting than the first. While I do \r\nlove a lot of the five tracks at the start, I find myself so much more interested in the later half, as it holds a lot more \r\nvariety for me. While the first half is certainly consistently good, I am more interested in the various genre fusions \r\nand change ups that occur from The Lesser Evil through All We Knew And Ever Loved, but that's just me.<p>Speaking of All We Knew And Ever Loved, man what an amazing closer to all this. While I may find Denial's Aria to be \r\nthe best track on this album, this track is a close second. This is where their post rock ideals shine thoroughly, \r\ncapturing an almost Godspeed You! Black Emperor tone and energy, whilst also still sounding very much like \r\nEarthside. Just the buildup, each melody going through quietly, rising and falling to where you are not sure when \r\nthe dramatics will reveal themselves. And when they do show up, they not only feel so otherworldly, but almost like \r\nyou are experiencing music for the first time ever. This is also where Jamie's guitar reaches a level of magic that I \r\nhave only seen Efrim Menuck reach in his various post rock projects, being this almost violin-like tone. It all comes \r\nto an end with a spattering of organs playing a singular bombastic chord, with the guitars in the back blaring \r\nsheepishly as the song closes out. It is basically a musical ecstasy in a way, creating a moment that I may never \r\nforget. Seriously, bravo on this wonderful track.<p>Certainly an album that must be listened to at least once. It features not only some of the most grand moments of \r\nprog metal this year, but features a variety of sounds and styles that I think anyone, no matter their musical \r\npreference, can certainly enjoy. As for myself, I believe with time and effort Earthside may become one the best \r\nprog acts of the 21st century for me, and that prospect may just be around the near future with how much time \r\nand effort they put into their music. If you want something good and new in the land of metal, look no further than \r\nthis record.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2977843#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2977843\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2977843\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 28, 2023</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2977843)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_3730101082023_r.jpg\" alt=\" Let the Truth Speak by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2023<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.36 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.36</span> | 93 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Let the Truth Speak</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Collaborator</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nA group of veteran thirty-somethings hailing from New Haven, Connecticut, who astonish and delight as they \"think \r\noutside the box\" of conventional sound and music making. One of the secrets to the success of these musicians (aside \r\nfrom their tremendous skills) is in their refreshingly imaginative song constructs. Another secret is their collaborations \r\nwith premier musicians (especially vocalists) from across the globe. (Who knew that a simple \"want ad\" on Facebook \r\ncould generate so many offers and suggestions--from artists all over the planet?!)<p>1. \"But What If We're Wrong?\" (4:30) what is basically a two-chord song is transformed as if by magic by the ingenious \r\nlayering of very active instruments above and around the core. It's as if the band turned something one dimensional \r\nand linear into something four-dimensional and subatomic! Awesome! (9.25/10)<p>2. \"We Who Lament\" (8:44) presenting one of those rare vocalists from the Layne Stayley, Ian Kenny, Einar Solberg \r\nclass: a female vocalist named Keturah (Allyson), who is from Malawi. Here Earthside present one powerful, impactful, \r\nand refreshing song. It is a rare thing to behold to find a song that is driven so completely by the drum kit--and in a \r\ncreative, melodic, and intrepidly multi-dimensional way that I am even more astounded as I listen to it each and every \r\ntime! The section between 5:10 (or even 4:30) and the song's end is one of the most dynamic, creative, virtuosic \r\nsections of progressive rock music that I've ever heard! Ever! The band seems to create something that flits in and out \r\nof three, four, and, at times, five dimensions! And I absolutely love the choral shouts in the background over the \r\nawesome djent music of the final 90 seconds! Pure prog perfection!\r\n     Easily the best drum performance that I've heard of all year. (Mega Kudos, Ben Shanbrom!) And bassist Ryan \r\nGriffin's djenty bottom-dwelling salvos stick with Ben all the way. Amazing synchornization! And Keturah's vocal \r\nperformance is definitely one of the best on the album (and this is an album of phenomenal guest vocal \r\nperformances). (20/20)<p>3. \"Tyranny\" (8:39) I love djent! the way those bass chords hit me in the chest! This song presents a little more of the \r\npiano-djent heard from France's KLONE and even Denmark's VOLA. Despite an opening motif that is perhaps a bit too \r\ndrawn out, this song has excellent flow, development, shifts and (in the second half) melodic themes with \r\nimpassioned play and vocals--a refreshing and nearly flawless song that gives so much more with each and every \r\nlistening. I don't like the fact that it's not until the fourth minute that we, the listener, get to hear the true power and \r\ntalent of freelance vocalist Pritam (\"Pritzz\") Adhikary. As a ballad singer, he's good, but as an enraged metallurgist, he \r\nis one of the best I've ever heard. \r\n     Again the way this band mysteriously creates such engaging melodies with such a \"big\" and multi-dimensional \r\nsound is astonishing. There is a big shift, stylistically, at 4:40, into a gorgeously spacious, intensely atmospheric (almost \r\nDream Pop) soundscape of guitar and bass arpeggi accompanied by Pritam's airy, floating, upper register vocalise. But \r\nthen at 5:58 Pritam and the band break back into the heavy palette of the prog metallists while, somehow, retaining \r\nthe conveyance of absolutely heart-wrenchingly gorgeous melodies. Miraculous! (As is Pritam's sincerely heart-felt \r\nperformance in those final minutes.) Not even KARNIVOOL, VOTUM, or THE CONTORTIONIST have ever done it so \r\nfully, so perfectly, so effectively! One of the best progressive metal songs I've heard since this year's Ok Goodnight and \r\nNw Obliviscaris albums hit my ears. (19.75/20)<p>4. \"Pattern of Rebirth\" (4:40) a more standard Prog Metal vehicle for vocalist AJ Channer (FIRE FROM THE GODS, Austin, \r\nTX). The keyboard parts are my favorite--reminding me of one of my all-time favorite Prog Metal tunes from Portland's \r\nTHE MERCURY TREE, \"Deep Five.\" I love the rap in the final 90 seconds with other voices woven over the three-range \r\ndjent chords. (8.875/10)<p>5. \"Watching the Earth Sink\" (11:46) opening with some solo electric guitar play, classical guitar style like MAUDLIN OF \r\nTHE WELL do. Guitarist Jamie van Dyck, one can tell, has had some serious classical guitar training (and commitment). \r\nIn the third minute bass, rim play, and a second guitar track are added before Ben Shanbrom offers his toms. \r\nTensions rise as the weave builds in the second half of the fourth minute, but then at 4:15, Ben's drums hit third gear \r\nand the rest of the band follows suite. In the sixth minute Ben's kick drum turns insistent metronome, leading the \r\nband into some awesome NEIGE/ALCEST-like walls of Shoegaze-metal with Ryan Griffin's awesome djent chord bass \r\nplay right there with him. These guys are so tight! Jamie steps in with his screaming lead guitar to take us even higher \r\nbefore things calm down for a bit in the seventh minute while Ben and Jamie seem to \"talk\" to one another through \r\ntheir instruments. At 8:15, then, comes the real calm before the storm as Frank Sacramone's slow-playing descending \r\nFender Rhodes arpeggi provide a wonderfully eerie pause while we wait for the ultimate d\u00e9nouement (we all know it's \r\ncoming)--which arrives slowly in the tenth minute, ushered in by Ben's driving tom and roto-tom play, while Jamie's \r\nguitar chords start to scream with increasing urgency. Some distant background vocals, big bass chords and low end \r\nfillers join in as chaos ensues. No lyrics or guest singer here. Just pure instrumental heaven (though not quite as \r\ncreative or multi-dimensional as the opening three songs). Still, an awesome song. (22.25/25)<p>6. \"The Lesser Evil\" (10:59) vocalist Larry Bragg (TOWER OF POWER) leads this one over some excellent, layered \r\nkeyboard work. Though not as Soul/R&B as one could expect with Larry's pedigree, there is definitely a completely \r\ndifferent side of Earthside on display for the first 3:20 of this. Horn blasts and very deep chunky bass enter and (bass) \r\ntake over as Larry's vocal definitely gets more R&B-familiar (not unlike a cross between Jeffery Osborne and Phillip \r\nBailey). Incredible vocal performance. Hard to believe this is happening on a prog metal album! Amazing saxophone \r\nsolo/work (and vocal) in the ninth minute! Mega kudos to these artists for not only taking a chance on this odd \r\nchemistry but for making it work! And work it does! This is one heck of a song (and Larry Bragg is one heck of a singer!) \r\n(18.75/20)<p>7. \"Denial's Aria\" (5:26) Welcome ViKKe (and, in a supproting role, Keturah) as well as harpist Dua Scorpio. With harp, \r\nkeys, deep bass thrums, and infinity guitar notes, the vocalists here wow and entertain with an incredibly innovative \r\nand creative weave of theatrical storytelling. Not really a full metal song, but incredibly powerful in its entirely unique \r\nand laudatory creative delivery. Heavy and emotion-packed. Who knew Soul/R&B could mix with metal? (9.5/10)<p>8. \"Vespers\" (2:41) more excellent keyboard work painting a lush, dreamy, even jungle-like soundscape within which \r\nseveral voices and vocalists (including ViKKe and Russian nature-singer sensation, Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh). I love \r\nthis song! (5/5)<p>9. \"Let the Truth Speak\" (10:47) Daniel Tompkins (TESSERACT, SKYHARBOR) takes the lead vocals this time with \r\nGennady Tkachenko-Papizh playing a supporting role within this very thick walls-of-djenty KARNIVOOL-like sound. \r\nVery impressive vocal performances but the music is surprisingly \"straightforward\" for a djent-metal song--sounding a \r\nlot like some of LEPROUS's dirtiest songs (like \"Slave\" or \"Coal\")--no dancing string-theory multi-verse circles around \r\nthe quantum core. (17.5/20)<p>10. \"All We Knew and Ever Loved\" (9:19) a cinematic prog homage to bands like GOBLIN and MIKE OLDFIELD that \r\nemploys the value-added services of long-time LEPROUS drummer, Baard Kolstad. (In the video of the recording of \r\nthis session, the two are seen split-screen duelling, synching, and weaving within and around one another in really \r\nentertaining ways.) Frank's heavy church organ is awesome throughout but truly essential to that magnificent \r\ncrescendo at the end. (18/20)<p>Total Time 77:31<p>One of the most creative, progressive rock albums I've heard in a long time. The engineering feats achieved here alone \r\nconstitute no small miracle of sound production: music that many times feels as if it goes beyond three dimensions, \r\ntaking the listener beyond the confines of space and time. <p>A/five stars; a total masterpiece of progressive rock music in the truest sense of that which is \"progressive.\" Definitely \r\nan album that belongs in every \"prog lover's\" music collection. For metal heads I should think those first three songs \r\nalone would make the price of admission worth it. All hail to these torchbearers of the progressive spirit of \r\n\"progressive\" rock music!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2971047#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2971047\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2971047\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 5, 2023</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2971047)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_3730101082023_r.jpg\" alt=\" Let the Truth Speak by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2023<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.36 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.36</span> | 93 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=81686\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Let the Truth Speak</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=42185\"><strong>Second Life Syndrome</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Prog Reviewer</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=42185\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/42185/riverside.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOriginally written for theprogmind.com<p>10/10<p>The bond you can form with a band is nigh unto sacred sometimes.  I've been following Earthside since before they \r\npossessed that name, since they were just high schoolers emerging from their proverbial cocoons.  And, oh, how \r\nproud I feel when I see the heights to which they can fly!  Their new album, Let The Truth Speak, is an evocative \r\nwitness to their collective mastery of both composition and emotion.  It releases on November 17th.<p>Earthside has kept us waiting for their sophomore album for eight long years now, but believe me when I say that it \r\nis worth every second.  Their 2015 debut A Dream in Static is a brilliant celebration of art and music theory, of \r\ncomposing with various themes and dynamics in play.  This album, however, is different, and on a completely \r\ndifferent level.  The band lineup consists of Jamie Van Dyck on guitars, backing vocals, programming, and additional \r\nkeys; Ben Shanbrom on drums and backing vocals; Frank Sacramone on keys, synth, programming, percussion, and \r\nadditional guitars; and Ryan Griffin on bass on backing vocals.  They bring with them a small army of vocalists and \r\nmusicians that I'll mention in time.<p>This is the same band, but a different side, an alternative perspective, from their debut.  While that album was \r\ncinematic and progressive and technical, Let The Truth Speak is a haunting, atmospheric, and illustrious tapestry \r\nthat is united by theme, by cinema, by visions, and by emotion.  It is more singular in its thematic outreach, yet its \r\nmusical expression is more diverse than the debut, and it represents the band accepting themselves for who they \r\nare on a deep level.<p>This is a progressive metal album, yes, but it is so much more.  It is towering, almost keeping me on my literal \r\ntiptoes with its highwire melodies.  It is mixed impeccably well, and so you will hear every riff, every orchestration, \r\nevery groove, and every sweeping motion in crystal clarity.  This album is perfectly comfortable in the warm \r\nambience, but just as comfortable with a crushing riff, a soaring piece of cinema, or a textured abstraction.  It is a \r\nvoyage through a deluge of sensations, a sepulcher of light, a dream of inner places.<p>I will readily admit that this album makes me cry from start to finish.  There are two reasons for this.  First, the \r\nimmensity of what these artists, these friends, have created is simultaneously a massive weight on my chest, and a \r\nfreeing spirit for my mind.  It makes me so happy and uplifted to hear what they have become.<p>Second, the themes of the album are perhaps quite potent for me.  If you have read the book I published earlier \r\nthis year, The Tumult of My Heart, you will know that the last 5-10 years of my life have been a search for \r\nsomething more, something truer.  And here this album comes along to validate that sense in me, the feeling that \r\nthe truth should speak for itself.  There are moments on this album that feel like I could have written them.  The \r\nsincerity of the lyrics speaks to my heart; the encouragement to abandon fear and to stand in confidence hits me \r\ndirectly in the chest.  And the music is tailored specifically to enhance and develop those themes into something \r\ntranscendent, transformative, and tantamount.<p>And that is exactly what Let The Truth Speak feels like: a tumult. It has ten tracks, and they are all glorious.  The \r\nopener \"But What If We're Wrong\" features Sandbox Percussion, and it is almost shy or teasing in how it plays with \r\nus, but before long a wave of riffs and orchestrations sweep in to see us off on our journey.  \"We Who Lament\" \r\nfollows, featuring singer Keturah, and the towering might of the emotions on this piece never fails to grab me by \r\nthe throat; I love the riveting drumming, the explosive vocals, and the ethereal emotions.  Next comes \"Tyranny\" \r\nwith Pritam Adhikary of the band Aarlon, and this song has more grit and more edge; still we get the expansive riffs \r\nand the feelings of vastness and openness, and the strings play a big role.<p>Two of my favorites come next.  First is \"Pattern of Rebirth\" with A.J. Channer of Fire from the Gods on vocals, and it \r\nis one of my favorite songs of the year.  This piece revels in the band's nu-metal influences, and it grooves and riffs \r\nwith utter majesty; however, the lyrics?written by A.J.?really speak to me and I find myself singing this one \r\nconstantly.  An instrumental piece \"Watch The Earth Sink\" comes next, and I'm sitting here right now ruminating \r\nover how amazing it is.  This track is rather reserved at first, even ambient, as the band deftly and lightly plays their \r\ninstruments.  But soon a massive wall of riffs blows into the scene, and then a stuttering guitar lick and sinister \r\norchestration blasts us off to another planet.  Jamie kills it on a huge solo, and the song just keeps mustering more \r\nand more courage as it plays for twelve minutes total. What a ride!<p>And the band is just getting started.  \"The Lesser Evil\" with Larry Braggs and Sam Gendel is one of the craziest songs \r\nI've heard this year; it is heavy and theatrical and even a little maniacal at points, and this is all augmented by a \r\nbrass section that slices through the metal in arresting fashion. It is unique and amazing.  \"Denial's Aria\" with \r\nKeturah, VikKe, and Duo Scorpio follows, and could be called the ballad of the album.  It is all about atmosphere \r\nand harmony, and I think it has one of the best choruses on the album, if you could call it that.  I love its burning \r\ncharacter.  \"Vespers\" with Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh and VikKe is the next song, and this one is like an interlude \r\nthat borrows the personality of the previous track, but takes it into a darker territory full of whispers and faraway \r\ncries.  I love it.<p>The last two tracks are massive.  The title track features Daniel Tompkins of TesseracT and Gennady Tkachenko-\r\nPapizh, and it is one of the more complicated pieces, vocally-speaking.  The orchestrations are exciting and \r\nvisionary and acrobatic here, and Daniel's fantastic voice and gritty screams are such an evocative and beautiful \r\nway to end the vocal portion of the album. It is truly a exotic and layered piece. <p>The closer, \"All We Knew and Ever Loved\", featuring Baard Kolstad of Leprous, released two years ago, and I hope \r\nyou've heard it.  This piece is a mountain of cinema and transformation.  It elicits so many feelings and haunted \r\nvisions of other places that are somehow also nostalgic and familiar, yet perhaps becoming alien to us?  It is \r\ngorgeous, from the depths of its ambient portions to the heights of its organ-driven climaxes, and it is a work of \r\nwonder.<p>Earthside have bested their debut, not just by writing better songs, but by offering us a loving, confident hand.  This \r\nalbum will lift you to the skies, and bury you in the dirt; it will force you to face those inner demons, but it will carry \r\nyou away to better places.  It is a work of skill and mastery, of many years of blood, sweat, and tears as the band \r\nhoned and finetuned every second.  This is surely the album that will leave its mark on 2023.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2968177#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2968177\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2968177\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, November 10, 2023</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=81686#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2968177)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_035824102019_r.jpg\" alt=\" A Dream In Static by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2015<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.01 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.01</span> | 128 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">A Dream In Static</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Special Collaborator</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>\"A Dream in Static\"</em> is the debut full-length studio album by US, New England based progressive metal act \r\n<B>Earthside</B>. The album was independently released in October 2015. <B>Earthside</B> consists of four well educated and \r\nhighly skilled guys, who all have college degrees in music composition and production (or other similar educational skills). It\u00b4s \r\nlike reading the <B>Dream Theater</B> fairytale again, but these guys of course deserve to be judged on their own merits. \r\n<B>Earthside</B> doesn\u00b4t feature a permanent vocalist, so the band have enlisted the services of singers like <B>Lajon \r\nWitherspoon</B> (Sevendust), <B>Bj\u00f6rn Strid</B> (Soilwork), <B>Daniel Tompkins</B> (<B>Tesseract</B>), and <B>Eric \r\nZirlinger</B> (<B>Face The King</B>, <B>Seer</B>).<p><em>\"A Dream in Static\"</em> features 8 tracks, and a full playing time 63:52 minutes. The album opens with the instrumental \r\n<em>\"The Closest I've Come\"</em>, and it\u00b4s audible from the get go, that we\u00b4re dealing with incredibly skilled musicians and \r\ncomposers. The performances are tight and the playing technically challenging. The material are relatively varied and while there \r\nare both heavy rhyhtms and hard edged riffing on the album, there are also a lot of more atmospheric parts, which lean more \r\ntowards progressive rock than progressive metal. There are even hints at post-rock which the slow building and atmospheric \r\n<em>\"Entering The Light\"</em> is an example of. The band make the use of different guest lead vocalists work pretty well. The album \r\ndoes however become slightly inconsistent and feels a little more like a \"project\" instead of a band effort, because there isn\u00b4t a \r\ndesignated vocalist in the band, but there is no denying that <B>Earthside</B> have chosen some really skilled guest vocalists \r\nwho fit well with the instrumental part of the music.<p><em>\"A Dream in Static\"</em> is a very well produced affair, featuring a powerful, clear, and detailed sound production, which suits \r\nthe material perfectly. Fans of the more polished and accessible type of progressive rock/metal should be thrilled with this \r\nalbum on all parameters from the high level performances, to the professional sound production, to the intriguing and clever \r\ncompositions. To my ears <B>Earthside</B> need to work on a more unique sound (there\u00b4s very little here that\u00b4ll surprise fans \r\nof the genre or which sets <B>Earthside</B> apart from other contemporary artists), and a little more raw edge wouldn\u00b4t hurt \r\neither, but that\u00b4s a purely subjective point of view and quality wise, this is a high quality release and a 4 star (80%) rating is fully \r\ndeserved.<p>(Originally posted on Metal Music Archives)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2282923#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2282923\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2282923\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, November 20, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=51267#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2282923)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_035824102019_r.jpg\" alt=\" A Dream In Static by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2015<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.01 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.01</span> | 128 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">A Dream In Static</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=35306\"><strong>Wicket</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Prog Reviewer</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=35306\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/35306/f&#111;nz.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis ain't your dad's progressive metal.<p>You see, in the old days, prog metal was still rooted in the origins of hair metal. Queensryche, Fates Warning, Symphony X, Evergrey, even Dream Theater. All these bands evolved their sound from the 80's hair metal scene and New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands (or NYOBHM for you young hipsters out there) like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden and the power metal genre that emerged from both of them. Most, but not all, based their sound on a wall of noise, usually playing fast as well, while incorporating progressive elements as they went. None of these things are bad, mind you. But these days things are changing.<p>Progressive metal bands nowadays are emerging from that little \"djent\" phase from a few years ago, remember that? When Meshuggah went full djent, death metal bands were like \"so cool, let's do nothing but this\" and turned out just awful crap. Even Meshuggah went too far off the deep end by just repeating themselves over and over again really loudly, like an angry girlfriend telling you what she wants to eat for the 1000th time even though you know what she wants because that's all she ever orders from her favorite restaurant.<p>But very quickly bands begin to emerge that incorporated djent sounds into their guitars, but sonically went exactly in the opposite direction, focusing more on atmosphere and sound that just straight walls of noise. Bands like Skyharbor, TesseracT, Disperse and Voices from the Fuselage balanced spacey and calm atmospheric and electronic textures with brutal djent chords and walls of distortion, but in a balanced way. They began to move away from screaming and instead allowed the guitars to blend in with the background, let the sound reverberate against itself and just transport you to the depths of space. It's music that balances loud and quiet and entrances you in ways metal never did before. It's a similar feeling with Earthside's debut \"A Dream In Static\", but different. Allow me to explain:<p>I first discovered these guys on their bandcamp page and when I saw them describe themselves as composers instead of musicians, immediately I was intrigued. Right away from their opener \"The Closest I've Come\", this is something completely different. Right away, the electronics in the background hiss and hum as the guitars kick in with a wall of noise. Instantly I'm picturing the vast emptiness of space, but it's not droning. It travels through loud and soft sections, playing off both loud and soft textures to enhance the flow of the music. It also doesn't hurt that guitarist Jamie van Dyck can make his guitar both shred and sing. It's not a huge solo fest, but for an eight minute-long track, it's soothing and settling, and apart from a heavy breakdown late in the song, it's entrancing, close your eyes and let the music take you on a journey through space.<p>But what amazes me most is the variety of each track. \"Mob Mentality\" is an absolute blockbuster, with a killer orchestration by the Moscow Studio Symphony Orchestra and some killer vocal work by Sevendust frontman Lajon Witherspoon.  It twists and turns like a classical symphony. From soft vocal bridges to operatic passages and soaring strings, it sounds like it's straight from an anime action movie. It's totally different from the last track, it doesn't allow you to settle into one state of mind, it tells a story with ups and downs that ends with an outstanding wall of noise and Witherspoon crooning his way before a dissonant dramatic orchestral stop.<p>From the sublime to the ridiculous and back to sublime with \"A Dream In Static\", once again favoring minimal chord changes for an echoing soundscape of reverb and noise with some occasional breakdowns, featuring Daniel Tompkins of Skyharbor and TesseracT, one of my favorite singers today because of his subtle yet commanding and haunting presence, as well as his piercing falsettos. Following that is the soundtrack inspiring \"Entering The Light\", a mainly orchestral piece featuring Max ZT with a dulcimer feature (when's the last time you listened to a song with a hammered dulcimer solo?).<p>\"Skyline\" changes gears a bit by being active in the first half, while slowing down a bit for the second half and creating a 4 over 3 polyrhythm that creates a hypnotic sensation (which features another awesome van Dyck guitar solo as well). The changes between time signatures are fluid enough so as not to ruin the flow of the music and yet the guitars don't seem to overpower as much as you might expect. It's an almost otherworldly feeling as the piano lilts it's motif repeatedly while the guitars sit back on a wall of reverb and the drums just crash away.<p>It's a similar feeling with \"Crater\". The guitars just build a wall of noise as the drums build and the bassline moves all over the place before emerging into a silent backdrop for Soilwork frontman Bjorn Strid to come in. This is actually an interesting song for Strid because, even though he does sing quite a bit in Soilwork, his vocal range and abilities are shown more in force on this one song than half of Soilwork's catalog. Only about a minute before song's close does he scream a bit, at the ultimate climax, but his voice is sensitive enough to resonate with the reverb and dissipating guitars during the silent sections, the atmospheric breaks that amplify the main sections. The chorus, like previous tracks, is hypnotic. By maintaining an ever present, but not overpowering, wall of sound, the band just flows atop of it like water, with drummer Ben Shanbrom hammering away before the song fades into an electronic atmospheric haze.<p>\"The Ungrounding\" is the most technical song of the lot, right away beginning with the thematic guitar lick and featuring a guitar spot from Henrik Gennert. This is where the band's true instrumental prowess shines, alternating from fast spastic lurches to slower atmospheric catches of breath, it's another song that's hypnotic at times, yet is still busy enough to be interesting. Nothing of the song feels out of place, except for perhaps the dissonant crunches towards the end, but that can also be seen as a breath of fresh air after staying fairly conservative tonality wise throughout the entire album.<p>But if the previous songs were hypnotic enough, the closer, \"Contemplation of the Beautiful\" is entrancing enough to damn near put you in a coma. At 11:49, it's the longest on the album, and with plenty of time to set the stage, it's enthralling atmospheric sounds, with a middle eastern sounding violin and an absolutely transcendent performance from Eric Zirlinger of Face The King fame. It cycles between quite meditative buildups and loud, bombastic bursts of violence with Zirlinger screaming like a man possessed.  The repeating ascending string melody entices you more and more as it drags on, increasingly getting louder as if beckoning you to lean in closer, like a snake being drawn to a charmer. These sections build for a few minutes before they overflow into bursts of sound and noise before fading as quickly as they build. It's a cycle that repeats for the length of the song, ending with a violin solo similar to the one that began the song, but it's a roller coaster ride regardless.<p>It's an amazing capstone to an album that, to me, redefined what progressive metal is, what it sill be and what it SHOULD be. This album opened the doors to Skyharbor, TesseracT, Disperse, Being, Voices in the Fuselage, David Maxim Micic, Sithu Aye and many more to me. As a Dream Theater junkie my whole life, the post Portnoy albums have started to underwhelm in recent years and I needed something new to captivate me, and this album came through in spades. Each track provides something new, each track is lively and full of energy, but soothing and docile enough to damn near bring me to tears (and it takes a lot for a song to make me cry, there's a special hall of fame for songs capable of doing that for me). It's another one of those albums that just has no equal. Other bands are imitating the song structures, the chords, the progressions, the wall of noise, the atmospheric interludes, but not in the same way that this band has that keeps each song interesting and fresh so much so that you keep coming back for more. A truly watershed moment that shows the capabilities of progressive metal once elevated from a hairspray and power metal influenced juggernaut to an enlightened classical display of performance art.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2272707#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2272707\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2272707\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, October 23, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=51267#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2272707)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/9683/cover_035824102019_r.jpg\" alt=\" A Dream In Static by EARTHSIDE album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2015<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.01 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.01</span> | 128 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=51267\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">A Dream In Static</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=9683\">Earthside</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Progressive Metal</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=60548\"><strong>Corcoranw687</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=60548\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/leaf.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n4.5 stars. What a statement of a debut album! This is a confident young band with no limit on their potential. I encountered this group live before hearing the album, and they blew my expectations away. First off, we don't get a lot of great concerts here in Ottawa, As groups tend to play Quebec City & Montreal before skipping right past to Toronto. Imagine my surprise when of all groups, playing at a dingy bar a block from where I work, comes Leprous! I was excited for weeks leading up to the show, I felt like a kid eagerly awaiting Christmas right up until I was in the door. I was a bit late but caught a different opening act before Earthside set up. I remember having my back turned when \"The Closest I've Come\" began, and being immediately compelled to head right to the front row to see this group in action. My first thoughts upon seeing them were that none of these musicians could be 30 years old, yet here they were playing cinematic prog metal that is actually something I haven't heard before. Their music is modern and complex, delicate and grandiose, catchy and well-composed. The real standout track that everyone needs to hear is \"Mob Mentality\", a 10 minute symphonic prog metal monster that honestly will get stuck in your head just like any much shorter song you would hear on the radio. I left this concert also like a kid on Christmas, having received a new gift that I wasn't expecting at all. I would recommend this album to fans of prog metal and fans of classic prog alike.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1699783#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1699783\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1699783\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, March 9, 2017</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=51267#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1699783)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:15px 0px;\">\r\n<font color=\"#a52a2a\">Thanks to <strong>aapatsos</strong> for the artist addition.\r\n\r\nand to <strong>Quinino</strong> for the last updates\r\n\r\n</font>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div><!-- End Main DIV -->\r\n\r\n\r\n</div> <!--END MAIN DIV-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:5px 0px;\">\r\nCopyright Prog Archives, All rights reserved. | <a href=\"Legalnotice.asp\"><font color=\"white\">Legal Notice</font></a> | <a href=\"PrivacyPolicy.asp\"><font color=\"white\">Privacy Policy</font></a> | <a href=\"/about_us.asp#advertise\"><font color=\"white\">Advertise</font></a><img src=\"../static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"> | <a href=\"/syndication.asp\"><font color=\"white\">RSS + syndications</font></a><img src=\"../static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:5px 0px;\">\r\n<strong>Other sites in the MAC network:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.JazzMusicArchives.com\"><font color=\"white\">JazzMusicArchives.com &mdash; jazz music reviews and archives</font></a> | <a href=\"http://www.MetalMusicArchives.com\"><font color=\"white\">MetalMusicArchives.com &mdash; metal music reviews and archives</font></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:20px 0px;\">\r\nDonate monthly and keep PA fast-loading and ad-free forever.\r\n<div style=\"margin:5px 0 0 0\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DRNRB8RG8NUN2\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:0px 0px;\">\r\n<!-- Server processing time: 0.91 seconds -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<script>(function(){function c(){var b=a.contentDocument||a.contentWindow.document;if(b){var d=b.createElement('script');d.innerHTML=\"window.__CF$cv$params={r:'9231421fb89d5d10',t:'MTc0MjQzMjI3Ni4wMDAwMDA='};var a=document.createElement('script');a.nonce='';a.src='/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/scripts/jsd/main.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(a);\";b.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(d)}}if(document.body){var a=document.createElement('iframe');a.height=1;a.width=1;a.style.position='absolute';a.style.top=0;a.style.left=0;a.style.border='none';a.style.visibility='hidden';document.body.appendChild(a);if('loading'!==document.readyState)c();else if(window.addEventListener)document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',c);else{var e=document.onreadystatechange||function(){};document.onreadystatechange=function(b){e(b);'loading'!==document.readyState&&(document.onreadystatechange=e,c())}}}})();</script></body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\n",
