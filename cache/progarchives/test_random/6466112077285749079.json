There is also more\r\nuse of ambient sound effects. It's also, in spite of the darker cover art, the\r\nbrighter and more optimistic of the two. In fact, I would go so far as to say that\r\nthis evokes in me the beauty I might imagine in Heaven. Yes, there are some dark\r\nplaces here, but overall, this is a very comforting work to listen to.<p>Probably PINK FLOYD's album <em>Meddle</em> is one of the best comparisons--especially\r\nto \"Svefn-G-Englar\", which seems to have been heavily influenced by \"Echoes\".\r\nAlthough \"Svefn-G-Englar\" is not an epic on the scale of \"Echoes\", it manages in its\r\nown way, the same kind of relaxed beauty found in the opening and closing sections of\r\nthe PINK FLOYD song. The classic rock influences also show in SIGUR ROS' reliance on\r\nmore traditional instruments rather than allowing it to be completely synth-driven.\r\nThe Hammond organ is clearly audible in \"Svefn-G-Englar\", and the Rhodes electric\r\npiano is featured in \"Hjartad hamast\". Also, the haunting backdrop common to most\r\nSIGUR ROS songs is not created by a synth, but instead by an electric guitar played\r\nwith a cello bow. JONSI's voice, rather than conveying any message, is an instrument\r\nin and of itself, even higher than RADIOHEAD's THOM YORKE, and even more melodic.<p>While it is all quite good, my absolute favorite tracks, without a doubt, are\r\n\"Staralfur\" and \"Hjartad hamast\". A gorgeous piano riff in \"Staralfur\" serves as the\r\nbackdrop to a beautiful string section. This is the sort of work with which I would\r\nlove to be greeted in Heaven--especially the final great orchestral solo. \"Hjartad\r\nhamast\" is a very interesting combination between a melancholy-seeming\r\nblues-influenced piece and a sequence so beautiful that it evokes a sense of flying.\r\nIn light of that section, even the more brooding sections no longer seem so dark.<p>Other highlights include the percussion work on \"Ny batteri\" and the piano on \"Vidrar\r\nvel til loftarasa\", as well as its innovative orchestral outro. The last two tracks\r\nseem to move in a less orchestral direction that foreshadows the work on <em>( )</em>.\r\n\"Avalon\" even takes on a somewhat minimalist approach not unlike TALK TALK's later\r\nwork. Lately, this album has even been a comfort in trying to deal with a recent\r\nloss. Others' perception of the music may differ, but the overall effect of this\r\nalbum is to uplift. While I respect both <em>Agaetis Byrjun</em> and <em>( )</em>, I must\r\nsay that this is the strongest of the two.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34511#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34511\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=34511\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, March 17, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #34511)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=440\"><strong>Chris S</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=440\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/440/solidair.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is a very good album coming from a band who decided to enforce their own \r\noriginality...Icelandic in nature and some fine vocal/musical interlay. This in my opinion is \r\ntheir strongest offering, the other albums being somewhat self indulgent. There have been \r\ncomparisons made between this band and Pink Floyd, especially this album. I have to \r\ncounter that by saying that there is nothing comparable to Floyd here from Sigur Ros. Give \r\nthem credit for originality sure but apart from the psychedelic era of PF, PF never went \r\nerrant in the form of pompous meanderings where Sigur Ros do occassionally. Worth \r\nchecking out though especially this album.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34514#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34514\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=34514\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, March 18, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #34514)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=2915\"><strong>Eetu Pellonpaa</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=2915\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/2915/paavatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nYes, this is a very good, laidback chiller album, with moody, emotional music. You can survive through it even in a bad hangover, listen it on the background or meditate through it intensively. The rhythms are slow and soft, and the instruments have smooth, pleasant tones. The mishmash language they sing is also soft and beautiful, so it doesn't matter even if you wouldn't understand the lyrics. Vocals work as an instrument, in the way I understand Jon Anderson tried to do in the golden days of Yes.

They are both great albums to own and they go \r\ntogether well. I feel like \"( )\" is sigur ros' sad, downer album, whilst this album is the \r\nuplifting happy album. Depending on what mood your after, they will both serve you well.<p>The intro on this album is a little sum up of sounds on the way. The second track is an odd \r\none, althought it doesn't progress much and lasts 10 minutes i find it very listenable. It has \r\na captivating spacey atmosphere and the vocals are positive and lifting. The track ends \r\nwith a cool dark side of the moon-esque heartbeat that adds to the atmosphere of this \r\npiece. This piece is very warm and fills you with a good feeling. It may require patience as \r\nit is a bit long winding but this is one of my fave pieces by Sigur Ros.<p>Track 3 however, is definitely my favourite of all their tracks. It has an amazing orchestral \r\nscore to it and the vocals are at their best. When the violins and vocals pick up it sounds \r\namazing! A truely spectacular moment, followed by a really amazing guitar to link it \r\ntogether as it then starts to build back up. A brilliant piece of music.<p>This album has some looming basslines and the guitars are played with violin bows to get \r\nthat effect. The sound they get is very reminiscent of \"The Dead Flag Blues\", from \r\nGodspeed You Black Emperor's debut, this is most noticable on the second track of this \r\nalbum.<p>Other amazing tracks are the title track which offers some amazing melodic string work and atmosphere. \"Bamm Bamm Bamm\" is very different to the others, adding more upbeat work to the album. tracks 4 and 5 deserve honourable mentions as these continue to build up one incredible album. \"Agaetis Byrjun\" is definetly in my list of landmark post rock albums along with \"F#A#oo\" and \"Skinny Fists\" by GYBE!, as well as \"Born Into Trouble...\" by A SILVER MT ZION.<p>The whole album follows a warm and spectacular journey with great vocal and orchestral \r\nwork. It doesn't matter if you can't understand Hopelandic because the tones of the vocals \r\nthemselves is what make their music work best. I highly recommend any fans of post rock, \r\nexperimental music to check these out. If you aren't into this genre its still worth getting as \r\nit would appeal to fans of symphonic rock. This will leave any listener with a warm feeling \r\nas it really is something incredibly unique and touching. Try and get your hands on this \r\nalbum and its follow up album, \"( )\".</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34520#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34520\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=34520\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 2, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #34520)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=882\"><strong>Trotsky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSigur R\u00f3s plays a strange sort of psychedelic New Age-y minimalist rock that was a natural \r\nextension of some of the more creative moments of the mid-90s Britpop \"movement\". \r\nObviously influenced by Pink Floyd, they cover the same ground (at various different \r\ntimes) as contemporaries Air, Portishead, The Verve and Spiritualized, although Sigur R\u00f3s \r\nis probably the least song based of the lot. <p>Most of the tracks on \u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun run from between 7-10 mins, and there is a strong, \r\nsweeping feel that can overwhelm you when you are listening to the album. The lack of \r\nvocal hooks and luxuries such as instrumental solos may make it hard to differentiate \r\nbetween the various tracks, and the fact that J\u00f3nsi Birgisson's high-pitched vocals are \r\nsung in a made-up language called Hopelandish (not that I think singing in their native \r\nIcelandic would have made Sigur R\u00f3s any more accessible) doesn't help either. But \r\nsomehow it doesn't seem to matter.<p>\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun is widely considered to be the best album Sigur R\u00f3s made and there are lots \r\nof beautiful melancholy moments lurking around this seamless work. I particularly like the \r\nstring-heavy Star\u00e1lfur and the strangely euphoric Olsen Olsen (replete with choir!) as well \r\nas the darker pieces Flugufrelsarinn and Hjarta\u00f5 Hamast (Bamm Bamm Bamm) , but none of \r\nthe tracks are weak. Still, I must say that while I know many people who love this album, \r\nSigur R\u00f3s' music isn't exactly what I look for in a prog band. ... 62% on the MPV scale</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34521#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=34521\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=34521\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 9, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #34521)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1962\"><strong>Yanns</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1962\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/scene_sunoverlake.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs I listened to this album more and more, I came to the undeniable conclusion that this \r\nis a five-star masterpiece album. From the first time I put on Svefn-g-englar, I knew \r\nthis was certainly something different. A parallel I made at first was to Pink Floyd, but \r\non further listening, I realized that they couldn't be compared. Sigur Ros has their \r\ncompletely own, unique style, and comparing them to any group, any person, is unjust. \r\nThis album is something that must be heard to be believed, because words do not \r\nexpress the feelings one derives from merely listening to this album.<p>Beauty like you've never imagined before. However, it isn't beauty like you may hear in \r\nsongs like I Talk To The Wind or Epitaph from King Crimson's debut. Its beauty in a \r\ncompletely different way, while delivering just as strong a punch. <p>From the moment I put on the first song (just accepted as (Intro), seeing as it wasn't \r\ngiven a name), I fade into another world. It succeeds in doing an extraordinary thing, \r\nsomething that not many pieces of music can do. It makes me forget everything. It \r\ntakes me somewhere else. Somewhere where things of this material world do not \r\nmatter. It's a wonderful place. <p>Some people have said that this would be the kind of music played as they marched into \r\nthe Gates of Heaven. Definitely understandable. Listenings to this album will show you \r\nthis. Again, I can not put into words properly everything I want to express. <p>Also, this band is classified under Experimental/Post-rock. I do not disagree with this \r\ncategorization. However, this might put an idea in your head about the band. You \r\nmight be comparing them to bands like Radiohead and The Mars Volta, which are also in \r\nthis genre. Forget all comparisons, forget everything you may be thinking. This is \r\ncompletely different from those bands. Completely. I do not argue the classification \r\nbecause there is no other place to put them. They are truly experimental, seeing as no \r\none else has ever done or achieved anything like this before. <p>Some standouts: Every song. Ha, yes, I'm serious. I can't single out a song or two or \r\nthree as weaker than the rest. I could name every song and rant and rave about it for \r\nextremely long periods of time. Simply put, this album is an 70 minutes of incredible, \r\nshattering the rules of music, much like The Mars Volta has done, only in a much, much \r\ndifferent way.<p>I challenge every single person reading this, male or female, black or white, young or \r\nold, stupid or smart, to give this album a listen. And then another. And another. And \r\nthen see what you think. I have no remorse, doubt, or problems with giving this a \r\nmasterpiece rating. 5/5.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=44641#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=44641\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=44641\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, August 28, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #44641)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1246\"><strong>Neu!mann</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1246\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1246/Foot-Foot_P.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nJudging from the number of reviews posted about them here at Prog Archives, I'm \r\nobviously not the first person to fall so completely under the spell of this otherworldly \r\nIcelandic band. And there are plenty of other, already well-established fans who could \r\ntell you a lot more about them than I ever could. A week ago I barely recognized their \r\nname; as recent as yesterday I had not heard a note of their music. But now I offer, \r\nfor your amusement and/or instruction, my first impression of SIGUR R\u00d3S, gleaned \r\nfrom one initial spin of what looks like their most popular album to date.<p>I still can't tell you a thing about the track list or personnel: the CD I borrowed (from a \r\nvery forward-thinking but typically cash-challenged Erie County library system) is \r\nmissing its booklet. So all I have to work with is a Xerox reproduction of the spooky \r\ncover art (the embryonic winged infant looking like a cross between Stanley Kubrick's \r\n2001 star child and the twisted thing in David Lynch's \"Eraserhead\"), and of course the \r\nmusic itself.<p>And what music it is. Brooding, melancholy post-rock dirges, with sheets of processed \r\nguitars churning like slowly cooling magma underneath a lot of subtle, ENO-influenced \r\nambient synthesizers, and with a restrained but powerful rhythm section adding a \r\nmeasure of heat to the sub-arctic chill of each song.<p>One beautiful moment follows another for a generous 71+ minutes, and the whole \r\nthing moves like a slowly advancing glacier of psychedelic Scandinavian sound, \r\nsaturated in reverb and conjuring images of Iceland's stark, uncompromising natural \r\nbeauty. That feeling is only enhanced by the breathy, evocative vocals, to the groups \r\nlasting credit sung in their native tongue (no Anglo-American cultural imperialism at work \r\nhere).<p>The extensive studio manipulation is reminiscent of RADIOHEAD's weirder sonic \r\nexcursions off the mainstream rock 'n' roll path. The opening introduction (which \r\nI now understand is simply titled \"Intro\") in particular is a pitch-perfect, affectionate \r\nplagiarism of \"Everything in its Right Place\", backwards singing and all. Elsewhere the \r\nalbum hints at the stately Prog adagios of Landberk circa \"Indian Summer\" (I'm thinking \r\nhere mostly of the simple but always elegant drum work), and at darker local influences \r\ntoo obscure to identify.<p>The music demands a patient set of ears, and works best when listened to in its \r\nentirety, late at night alone in a darkened room (headphones are optional).<p>It's always a thrill to discover uncharted musical territory for the first time. And after \r\nonly one brief exposure to a single album, I'm ready to pack my bags and begin \r\nexploring the SIGUR R\u00d3S sound more deeply.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=49738#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=49738\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=49738\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 2, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #49738)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=164\"><strong>Carl floyd fan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=164\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/animal_m&#111;nkey2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAnother incredible album by the folks known as sigur ros.

The vocals are just as lovely as ever \r\nand a made up language.  What they mean we may never know but hopefully they aren't \r\nevil.   The musicain ship is top notch and quite unique as well.

Sigur Ros are the poster boys for the post-rock movement, and this album\r\nis their crowning acheivement.  The music is more diverse than their previeous\r\nefforts, but still true to their sound.  What sound is that?  If I were to review\r\nthis album in one word, that word would be \"lush\".  Thick orchestration, diverse\r\ninstrumentation, plenty of atmosphere, an overall very rich sound.  Don't look for\r\nanything technical, but musical innovation abounds.  Also, the vocals come from one\r\nof the most unique singers in modern rock music.  His voice is perfectly emotive, so\r\nmuch so that you need not understand a single word of icelandic to know exactly what\r\nhe's trying to get across.  While the record is ambient in nature, the melodies are\r\nso beautiful and strong that they still manage to hold attention firmly.  At times it\r\nis difficult to believe that the sounds are being made by a rock band.  The stand-out\r\ntracks on this album include #3, 4, and 8 (I'll refrain from trying to type out the\r\nactual icelandic titles).  So, this is without doubt for me a five star album that\r\nshould be experienced by one and all, regardless of their pre-disposition toward\r\npost-rock or ambient music.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=84162#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=84162\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=84162\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, July 19, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #84162)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n4.1 Stars: Creative minimalist beauty<p>This is an album very difficult to describe as I don't think I've ever heard anything\r\nlike this. This album is ambiental and minimalist (as in using repetition) and barely\r\nrocks. You might call it new age, but it is different from that. One example is the\r\nlack of synthesizers. Here, the music is played by symphonies, extremely reverbed\r\nelectric guitars played with a cello bow, and standard rock instruments. The tone of\r\nthe music is generally bright and happy and can really uplift you even if you don't\r\nunderstand the icelandic lyrics. Just like the way Radiohead depresses you\r\ninstrumentally with \"Kid A\", this album instrumentally lifts you up because the band\r\nknows how to make the music emotional.<p>The reverbed guitar is introduced in the first epic \"Stefn-g-englar\" and is used in\r\nmany other songs such as \"Hjartao\". The vocals are very unusual and makes me wonder\r\nif the singer is a man or a woman. They certainly work in this album for me, though I\r\nmight understand if someone does not like the vocalist since some of the vocal\r\napproaches can be a bit overwhelming and repetitive (\"It's Youuuu\" in Svefn-g-Englar).<p>I don't think the intro has much to offer besides a preparation of the next track called\r\n<strong> Svefn-g-Englar </strong> which is a song that represents the band's sound. All of the\r\nelements discussed above are present here, though the song ends into an surprisingly\r\nunecessary electronica beat. <strong> Star Alfur </strong> is the happiest song of the album\r\nand also probably the band's most accessible track in their career. It features\r\ngorgeous orchestration that fits perfectly into the poppy sound of the song. There\r\nare also some unusual elements such as a distorted acoustic guitar (?), and\r\nstop-start part that introduces the initial melody with symphonic percussion. Due to\r\nthe genius use of the Orchestra and the brilliant melodies, I think that this is one\r\nof the most beautiful modern songs I've ever heard. <strong>  Flugufrelsarinn </strong> uses\r\nthe laid back atmosphere and soaring reverb guitars from \"Svefn\", though I believe\r\nthis song is stronger because it avoids having an irritating vocal hook like Stefn's\r\n\"It's you\" and is not as repetitive. <strong> N\u00fd Battery </strong> starts as a subdued horn\r\narrangement and mysterious bass line until it crushes you with a simplistic, yet\r\nperfect drum line. <strong> Hjarta\u00f5 Hamast </strong> is the next main highlight of the album:\r\nan uptempo song driven by a masterful ascending riff. The choruses of this song are\r\nextremely powerful with the soaring guitars going louder than metal. <strong> Vi\u00f5rar Vel\r\nTil Loft\u00e1rasa </strong> uses a great melancholic piano melody and builds from there. A\r\nvery minimalist piece, but very effective overall and one of the highlights of the\r\nalbum. <strong> Olsen Olsen </strong> begins as a laidback song and ends with bombast and\r\neuphoria. <strong> \u00c1gaetis Byrjun </strong> is probably the least memorable track of the album,\r\nyet still stands as a good song with excellent piano work. <strong> Avalon </strong> is the\r\noutro, just like the intro serves as the beginning of the album.<p>I highly recommend this album as it is something very different. Voted as the best\r\nalbum from Iceland in the 20th century, there is a lot to like about this album. <p>Highlights: Star Alfur, Hjartao Hamast, Viorar Vel Til Loftarasa.<p>Let Downs: None, though the music after Viorar Vel is not as strong as the rest<p>My Grade : B<p><p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88005#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88005\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=88005\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, August 22, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #88005)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8838\"><strong>Australian</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8838\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20060728_222904_wtf2.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\"is yet another otherworldly album from one of the leaders in Post-Rock. \r\nThe feeling of otherworldliness is stronger here than in any other album from Sigur R\u00f3s, \r\nI guess its because the use of strings is more prominent in \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" than any \r\nSigur R\u00f3s album yet. The presence of the strings, guitar played with a cello bow as well \r\nas the misty keyboard sounds and twinkling percussion here and there conjures a \r\nfloating, beautiful atmosphere which few bands can produce. It is for this reason \r\nthat \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\"is such an efficient, moving album and to this day remains Sigur \r\nR\u00f3s' defining album. <p>The musical feeling of \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun \"captures the spirit of some of \"Tales From \r\nTopographic Ocean\" (by Yes) for me, while not being quite as good. Also the fact that \r\nall the vocals on \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" are sung in Icelandic adds another element of \r\notherworldliness, as I am left wondering what the lyrics mean. The vocals are usually \r\nrepetitious with the same words being repeated several times, with instrumental \r\ninterludes. Basically all of Sigur R\u00f3s' stuff follows this pattern; I have to admit that it \r\ndoes sometimes get rather annoying. <p>The most rewarding material on \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" is \"Star\u00e1lfur\",\"Svefn-G-\r\nEngla\"r, \"\u00c1gaetis Byrjun\",\"Avalon\" all of which display the same characterizes. That said \r\nthe true stand out for me is \"Star\u00e1lfur\"which was used in Wes Andersons' fantastic \r\nfilm \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" at the climax of the movie.  None of the \r\nmaterial on \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\"is disappointing, what I love about this band is that when \r\nthey release an album, everything on it is at a high standard. Even 'Von' wasn't too \r\nbad, it just didn't have as full a sound as following albums and the compositions where a \r\nbit weak.<p>\"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\"has been voted the best 20th  cent. album by an Icelandic band, that is a \r\ngreat achievement. I don't know much about Icelandic music but I do know \r\nthat \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\"is some good quality music. The album reached a top charting of 52 \r\nin the UK (far below Takk) and set the scene for the band's following works. From the \r\nThunderous soundscapes to the mellow string instrumental sections \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" is \r\nhighly enjoyable. The one thing I don't understand are the angel-fetus creatures on \r\nthe cover and in the CD booklet, what are they supposed to be?<p>\"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" is a very rewarding album if listened to under proper circumstances. \r\nOne day when your alone, and you have a good pair of headphones handy take a \r\ngood long listen and soak in all the goodness of this album. A very good album and truly \r\ndeserving to be considered among the most amazing Post-Rock albums ever. I'd \r\nrecommend \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\"to any fan of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, or anything \r\nsimilar. I'd also like to say to everyone that \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" is a very interesting listen \r\nand.come on, try something different. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=91106#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=91106\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=91106\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, September 22, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #91106)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe title of this album apparently means \"A good beginning\" and this really is the record that made them famous. So much emotion and atmosphere on this recording. Very powerful.<p>\r\n\"Intro\" is spacey with vocals then it turns very atmospheric and blends into \"Svefn-G-Englar\" where the sound is so mighty that it almost vibrates. Guitar 1 1/2 minutes in is monstrous. Vocals after 2 minutes. Drums are more prominant after 6 minutes then violin. \"Staralfur\" opens softly and builds with piano and strings. Vocals before a minute. Pure emotion 2 1/2 minutes in. Some brief acoustic guitar and reserved vocals then back to previous melody. Classical music 4 1/2 minutes in. Themes are repeated and then it gets experimental after 6 minutes. \"Flugu Frelsarinn\" sounds so good with that powerful undercurrent. Vocals 1 1/2 minutes in. Great track ! \"Ny Batteri\" is minimalistic with horns coming and going until we start to get a melody around 2 minutes.Vocals follow.This is very laid back but I really like it. Lots of atmosphere. It kicks into a higher gear before 5 1/2 minutes with drums. Horns are back a minute later as it calms back down.<p> \"Hjartao Hamast (Bamm Bamm Bamm)\" opens with piano and harmonica. This is SIGUR ROS ? A fuller sound before a minute followed by vocals. Some back up vocals on this one as well. An interesting song. I like the experimentation 6 1/2 minutes in to the end. \"Viorar Vel Til Loftarasa\" opens with feedback and other sounds. Piano after a minute and it builds. Strings after 3 minutes and it gets spacey. Vocals 5 minutes in. It settles after 7 minutes then builds to an emotional and powerful soundscape 8 minutes in. Some dissonance late. \"Olsen Olsen\" opens with vocal melodies that sound far off. Drums and a fairly deep soundscape take over. Vocal melodies are back. This all sounds so amazing. So rich and full. \"Agaetis Byrjun\" is uplifting to start. Vocals before 1 1/2 minutes. \"Avalon\" is 4 minutes of spacey sounds.<p>\r\nI personally feel that SIGUR ROS improved upon this album with \"( )\" and \"Takk\" but this is the foundation, and many feel this is their best. It's hard to argue against that.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93212#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93212\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93212\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 3, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93212)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1123\"><strong>TRoTZ</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nConsidered, by many rock reviews, as one of the most acomplished rock albuns ever made, \r\ni can not agree more with it. The album is completely different, taking the listener to new \r\nboundaries, transporting to the dreamy-pop atmospheres of nowhere, or perhaps, to the \r\nfreezing celestial nature of Iceland, home country of the band.<p>This could be made possible by the extreme intelligence of the band on using their \r\nrespective instruments. The combination of Kjartan Sveinsson inspirate dreamy creations, \r\nwith the J\u00f3nsi Birgisson cutting-tearing guitar, not forgetting to mention the celestial \r\naspect of his voice, and the surreal bass lines of Georg Holm, allied with varied \r\norchestration all through the album, from violins, percussion to saxo, all of them seem to \r\nbe made to elicit the complete magnitude of the magical and surreal aspects of music. Here \r\nand there, if we want to be perfectionists, whe can find ocasionally some immature studio \r\narrangements, but not enough to touch the symphonic magnificiency of the album. \r\nParticularly high point of this album is the musical moment from track 6 to 8, with no weak \r\npoints, showing an almost \"above-human\" sensibility.<p>When everyone questions where rock can take us more, if there is much more space to \r\ndiscover, Sigur R\u00f3s proved everyone with this album that new boundaries for rock are \r\npossible, even more heartbreaking and intriguing.

I do. It was characterized by\r\nthoughts such as \"get to the point\" and \"her voice is kinda annoying after awhile\".<p>I am so happy I kept at it. My last few years with \u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun have been bliss. I\r\nget shivers from the first few harmonized vocals of \"Intro\" and the wonder and\r\nrespect continue through the remainder (though I must admit that the slowed-down\r\nrehash that is \"Avalon\" is more or less optional).<p>If you have no experience with Sigur Rod, or Post-Rock in general, expect atmospheric\r\nwashes of organic sounds at a deliberate (one might say glacial) pace. However,\r\nbackground music it ain't; intensely emotional, the depth of the songs are belied by\r\nan apparent simplicity and restraint. While you don't get the socio-political sound\r\nsculptures of GODSPEED YOU! BLACK EMPEROR and A SILVER MT. ZION, or the (relatively)\r\nheavier rock buildups common to MOGWAI, you do get a more defined and personal sound\r\nidentity. The Hopelandish lyrics place the vocals into almost intrumental space;\r\ntranslations add but a fractional enhancement to the full emotive capacity. The near\r\nredundancy of the refrain to \"Svefn-G-Englar\" completely fails to grate like it used\r\nto, and I'm even almost over the embarrasment of discovering that the singer is male.<p>\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun is by no means all airy-fairy sweetness and light; though the overall\r\nfeel is one of floaty serenity, there's an undercurrent of urgent intensity that\r\nespecially comes to the fore in \"Ny Batteri\" and \"Hjarta\u00f5 Hamast\". At times, Jonsi\r\nseems on the verge of despair; at others, such as \"Flugufrelsarinn\", there's a\r\ncreeping, insidious quality that appeals as much to my gothic sensibilities as do the\r\nmore common hints of mournfulness or melancholy. It is precisely complexities and\r\ncontrasts of this nature that keep Sigur Ros from being lumped in with banal New Age\r\nor Head Music comparisons. <p>\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun features more symphonic texture than other Sigur Ros releases, which\r\nleads to such delights as the soaring, heartbreaking \"Star\u00e1lfur\" and the triumphant\r\nfinale to \"Olsen Olsen\", which adds a hint of playfulness in its brassy Nordic\r\nfanfare. Still, much of the album is built around the heavily reverbed bowed guitar\r\nand breathy, compressed vocals of J\u00f3nsi. If these don't do it for you, none of the\r\nother (slightly more experimental) albums by the band are going to win you over either.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=115452#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=115452\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=115452\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, March 17, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #115452)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9032\"><strong>OpethGuitarist</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nEmo is not emotional. This is. <p>In the band's finest offering so far, Agaetis Byrjun is a compelling album with soft\r\ntextures, atmospheric qualities, and despite its tortoise like speed, proves that\r\nslow and steady really does win the race. This is an astounding achievement in the\r\nfield, and despite the lack of followable vocals, proves that the bands ability to\r\ncraft a variety of gripping soundscapes makes it a leader of the genre. <p>What makes the music so great is its ability to capture the human spirit, the\r\nemotions deep within us, all while using a minimalistic approach is quite inspiring.\r\nThere is actually very little \"rock\" here. Do not expect any blues-based riffage or\r\nawe-inspiring melodies. The keys here are texture and atmosphere, timbre, to create\r\nthe sound and the experience. Sigur Ros's Agaetis Byrjun is as much a listening\r\nexperience as it is a visual one. The star track for me is the 2nd one, which I would\r\nnot even attempt to pronounce for fear of humility. <p>Many would like to claim the prog has lost its passion, that its soulless technical\r\nmusic. I would like to offer this piece as a counter to these claims, that prog has\r\nnever been about technical virtuosity, though it has always been more present in prog\r\nthan in contemporary rock.

They even follow the same \r\nscheme (intro ambiences for 15 minutes or so - couple of songs - long ambience in the middle - couple of songs again, including \r\nthe eponymous one). Yep, they've matured in songwriting. Yeah, there are some nice melodies and enjoyable tunes, but for me \r\nAB says nothing really - apart from almost excellent ( ) and enjoyable ''Takk...''. But hey, could the eponymous track be a bit \r\nshorter? I'd definitely enjoy it better. Anyway, while ''Von'' represented dark side of SR and had 1.5 from me (rounded to 2), AB \r\ngets 2.5 for its lighter side ...but again rounded to 2 due to massive disappointment - I thought this is really a Masterpiece, but I \r\ngot the same stuff again, a little re-worked and improved though.

Obviously, I'm in the minority of of people who think that, considering the album is the #1 album of our post \r\nrock/math rock sub genre. My belief on the idea behind the music of Sigur ros is that they take the imperfections of the many \r\ninstruments they play, and the falsetto Icelandic vocals, and make it into something beautiful, and they do an extraordinary job of it. \r\nThe music of sigur ros is, and will always be some of the most beautiful of our time, this album is no exception, but I feel that unlike \r\n( ), They put the most beautiful/easy listening songs at the front, and the more experimental stuff towards the end, on a 70 minute \r\nlong album, that is almost impossible to make a five star album with.<p>With the famed Svefn-G-Englar opening after the intro song, you are set up for quite the treat. With it's mesmerizing e-bowed guitar \r\nand almost anthemic chorus, the song could almost be considered an epic. Don't be fooled though, that's not what the albums \r\ncomprised of, soon to come, are beautiful string songs, up toned horn songs, and even quirky bluesy songs. Through all this though, \r\nthe album is dominated by a melancholic feel, and a sleepy atmosphere. At first listen, the album is quite a chore to get through \r\ncompletely without either falling asleep, or just needing to break up the monotony with another disc. It will break into you over time \r\nthough, even if it doesnt come full circle, songs like staralfur and Olsen Olsen are sure to be absolute musts in your post rock \r\narchiving.<p>I really do enjoy this album, but like I said, it's song placement led to it's three star making. The last four songs all carry the same \r\nmood/atmosphere, and song structure, though they are great songs, placing them all in one big clump in an hour+ album is not the \r\nway to make THE post rock masterpiece. If you are more of a song person rather than album person, you will love this album, no \r\nquestions asked, every song has one part that makes you lean back open jawed in amazement. I'm an album person though, and \r\nas far as album making goes, execution of song place is key, Aegetis Byrjurn didn't quite execute.<p>3 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=158295#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=158295\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=158295\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 10, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #158295)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=21556\"><strong>DamoXt7942</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=21556\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/21556/KEISHIRO_BY_EETU.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs I should say in a tiny phrase, Really incomplete wave and atmosphere of music.\r\nAt first the sleeve of the album knocked me out (to tell the truth, this is the second album that I saw the \r\nfront face and at once bought without listening to the content).

The album was released through Icelandic label <B>Smekkleysa</B> in June 1999, and became a highly successful release in their native country, leading to the album being picked up by independent English label <B>FatCat Records</B> for an international release in 2000.<p><B>Sigur R\u00f3s</B> 1997 debut album <em>\"Von\"</em> is an ambient affair, featuring uncompromising and not particularly accessible post-rock, but <B>Sigur R\u00f3s</B> opted for a more compromising approach on <em>\"\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun\"</em>. The music is still highly ambient, ethereal, and dreaming in nature, but it also features both vocal and instrumental melodic hooks, making it a much more asseccible release than its direct predecessor. <p>Drums/percussion are used sparingly (and when they appear they are typically subdued and placed low in the mix, although there are a few exceptions with louder more dominant drumming), and much of the music is build around lead vocalist <B>J\u00f3nsi Birgisson's</B> emotional vocal delivery (both tenor and high pitched falsetto) and his cello-bowed guitarwork and occassional use of orchestration (mostly strings, but also the occassional use of horns). bass and keyboards are also instruments used on the album to create the ambient soundscape. The lyrics are in Icelandic (except for the lyrics on <em>\"Olsen Olsen\"</em>, which are performed in a made-up language), but the deep melancholy and burning passion are impossible not to be affected by, regardless if you understand what is being sung. <p>I hear many different influences on <em>\"\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun\"</em>, but I\u00b4d mention artists like <B>Radiohead</B>, <B>Talk Talk</B> (listen to the first couple of minutes of <em>\"N\u00fd Batter\u00ed\"</em> to hear that reference), <B>The Cure</B> (listen to the opening section of <em>\"Olsen Olsen\"</em>) as some of them. A couple of times I was also strongly reminded of <B>Robert Wyatt</B>.<p><em>\"\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun\"</em> features a gorgeous, detailed, and very well sounding production job, courtesy of <B>Ken Thomas</B>, who were introduced to <B>Sigur R\u00f3s</B> through his previous work with <B>The Sugarcubes</B>. Kudos must be given to <B>Thomas</B> for creating such a perfect sounding environment for <B>Sigur R\u00f3s</B> music to shine to maximum effect. Upon conclusion <em>\"\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun\"</em> is a giant step up on quality and accessibility compared to <em>\"Von\" (1997)</em> and it deservedly put <B>Sigur R\u00f3s</B> on the international music map and ignited their career. A 4.5 star (90%) rating is deserved.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=205865#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=205865\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=205865\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, March 9, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #205865)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI never thought that post rock from Iceland could be this uplifting while still maintaining a decent\r\nlevel of challenge! <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun</em> features many stand-out compositions like the wonderful\r\n10-minute chill-out anthem <em>Svefn-G-Englar</em> and my personal favorite <em>N\u00fd Batter\u00ed</em> which,\r\njust like <strong>UMUR</strong> pointed out in his review, starts off with a definite nod at Talk Talk's two\r\nfinal studio albums.<p>\r\nThe best thing about this release is that its incredibly smooth and by that I mean it offers a great\r\nfeeling of the overall theme without a single lesser or dull moment. This 70+ minute album of music\r\njust flows by and it's easy to get absorbed by the who experience.<p>\r\nIf you haven't heard it then please do because it's not often you'll get to to hear such a solid\r\nalbum! My only possible reason for not going all the way and rating it as essential is quite\r\npersonal.

Albums this original and this moving are rare nowadays. I'm not too familiar with post rock, but what I've heard so far was fantastic. AB brings you into another world, a beautiful and peaceful one(not many dark or creepy moments here), an incredibly light and ethereal album that makes the listener feel like he has just reached the gates of heaven. Therefore a happy album, different from the creepy, tense and anxious  atmospheres that reign in Godspeed you! Black emperors album \" F#A# infinity\". I could easily say that this is one of the best albums of the nineties and one of the very best of the whole post rock genre.

Ambient aerial liquid down tempo sound with deep roots in Talk\r\nTalk later experimental albums. Great female vocals, with some The Cranberries echoes in its.\r\nAbsolute Nordic atmosphere, only the best bands from area can build such authentically (not only in\r\npost-rock, same in Nordic jazz and fusion). Long compositions, some folksy flavours and plenty of\r\nelectronics which never sound as synthetic electronics.<p>Too different album from what we expect from great prog albums. Easy accessible, but not always\r\ntruly accepted. Simple and important as cornerstone of new sound. Post rock was exploded and burned\r\nvery fast, but till now myriads of post-rock bands sound \"as Sigur Ros\". <p>And I prefer such, Nordic post-rock gene against loudly twin-guitars driven American one. Because\r\nthere in Sigur Ros music you can hear all spacey Pink Floyd legacy and ambient Fripp legacy, and\r\nNordic ECM minimalistic aerial jazz of Jan Garbarek. In fact, this Sigur Ros album is their\r\nconcentrated sound which will stay in history as Nordic post-rock example. And it's not such a small\r\nthing...<p>Near all these importance and influences, this album is real pleasant to listen. Dreamy atmospheric\r\none - listen it, and if you're not a big fan of post-rock, you just will need a very few more albums\r\nto know  what post rock is all about.<p>My rating is 4+</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=296003#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=296003\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=296003\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, August 24, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #296003)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI can think of very few albums in the last 20 years which feel and sound as if they come out of nowhere--are unlike anything else that came before them--are so unique that they stand out so starkly from the rest of music of the day. KARDA ESTRA's Eve, THE MARS VOLTA's De-loused in the Comatorium, ULVER's Shadows of the Sun, and MAUDLIN OF THE WELL's Part the Second are a few of the others that come to mind. Several songs on this 1999 album are to this date among the best ever made in the Post Rock/Math Rock sub-genre:  \"Svefn-G-Englar\" (10:06) (19/20), \"Flugufrelsarinn\" (9/10) and \"Star\u00e1lfur\" (6:46) (9/10). \"Ny Batteri\" (8:12) (15/15) still never fails to leave me stunned/in awe every time I hear it.<p>1. \"Intro\" (1:36) let's you know you're in for something new and unusual. Kind of psychedelia-BEATLES-esque (4.5/5)<p>2. \"Svefn-g-englar (Sleep(walk)ing Angels)\" (10:04) So simple. So amazing. Organ, bowed electric guitar, brushed snare drum, and J\u00f3n's unusual falsetto. (19.5/20)<p>3. \"Star\u00e1lfur (Staring Elf)\" (6:46) strings and keys open this classic. J\u00f3nsi uses a lower octave range for his voice. He sounds like a normal kid. It sounds like a song of reverence or worship. Awesome arrangement. (13.5/15)<p>4. \"Flugufrelsarinn (The Fly's Savior)\" (7:48) back to the sounds and styles of song #2 with a little more emphasis on moving and screeching of the \"whale\" guitar. Again, J\u00f3nsi chooses a different singing style--more mid-range--deeper and fuller voice. I like the bass and organ lines on this one. (13.5/15)<p>5. \"N\u00fd Batter\u00ed (New Batteries)\" (8:10) simple one of the most unusual and powerful songs of my life. It gets me every time, from start to deep brass to crashing drums to finish. (15/15)<p>6. \"Hjarta\u00f0 Hamast (bamm Bamm Bamm) (The Heart Pounds (boom boom boom))\" (7:10) has a little DOORS/classic rock feel to it with the slow-bouncing organ chords--but then J\u00f3nsi's guitar enters to tell us otherwise. The vocal section truly harkens back to the psychedelic blues-jazz of the late 1960s. The chorus section sound more BEATLES-like--though more psychedelic than John, Paul, George, and Ringo ever went. Love the prominent strings in the second half and final section. (13.75/15)<p>7. \"Vi\u00f0rar Vel Til Loft\u00e1rasa (Good Weather for an Airstrike)\" (10:17) the title tells you exactly what it feels like you're hearing in the opening minute. Piano and deep bass eventually take over playing a pleasant, almost familiar ELTON JOHN-like piece--even when the full strings join in. Pedal lap/slide guitar joins in. J\u00f3nsi doesn't start singing till half way into the song--and then it feels/sounds secondary, extemporaneous, almost stream-of-conscious/demo-like. Slows to a standstill for just a few piano notes/chords before the whole \"orchestra\" unleashes it's crescendo of sound. Sounds like famous end of the HOLLIES song (\"All I Need Is the Air that I Breathe\"). Spectacular! Beautiful! One of the best endings I've ever heard of any song! Too bad the rest of the song didn't quite live up to that standard. (18.5/20)<p>8. \"Olsen Olsen\" (8:03) rolling bass and slow drum beat provide background for J\u00f3nsi's far-in-the-background falsetto vocals for the first two minutes. Strings join in in the fifth minute with male choral vocalise. The first and only weak song on the album. (12/15)<p>9. \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun (A Good Beginning)\" (7:55) bass, slow drums, and piano slowly open this one before electric piano gently solos over the top. At 1:20 electric piano stops as J\u00f3nsi's high pitched voice enters (up front) singing with those long, sustained vowels. A second, higher octave piano arpeggio is added between the first and second verses and continues throughout. Electric piano (glockenspiel) arpeggio is added after the second verse. By now J\u00f3nsi is using a broader range of octaves. Okay song. Might mean more if I knew the lyrics. (12.5/15)<p>10. \"Avalon\" (4:02) opens with low end electronica filling the sonic field. Pitch-mobile \"horns\" join in and take over during third and fourth minutes. Great ending to a great album. (9/10)<p>Total Time: 71:51<p>A-/five stars; a minor masterpiece of progressive rock music and a genre-defining album and gut-wrenching listening experience (especially the flawless first half).</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=328974#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=328974\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=328974\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, November 21, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #328974)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=30993\"><strong>zravkapt</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=30993\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/30993/42stupidcute.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe second album from this Icelandic band is one of the more popular post-rock albums. Next \r\nto Mogwai and GYBE, Sigur Ros are probably the most influential post-rock group. They sing \r\nin their own made up language called Hopelandic. I don't see what the point is as most non-\r\nScandinavians probably think they are singing in Icelandic anyway. The vocals generally \r\nsound like some kind of Bjork/Thom Yorke hybrid. I can hear influence from 1990s alternative \r\nrock on this album. I haven't heard the debut yet but those influences are supposed to be even \r\ngreater there. The songs are generally long and don't change much throughout their duration. \r\nAlthough this is a band with typical instrumentation, the presence of string and wind \r\ninstruments seems to stand out a lot of the time.<p>\r\nThe album starts with a spacey intro with lots of backwards effects. This leads directly \r\ninto \"Svefn-G-Englar.\" I guess you could desribe this as ambient-rock. I like the change after 6 \r\nminutes, very Floyd sounding. \"Staralfur\" sounds influential to some later post-rock. The piano \r\npart sounds like U2 and also sounds similar to some of the piano playing you would hear \r\nlater with bands like Muse and Coldplay. \"Ny Batteri\" begins with some random noises from \r\ndifferent instruments. Gets more atmospheric and a bassline starts. Vocals join in. Halfway \r\nsome awesome sounding drums come in.<p>\r\n\"Hjartao Hamast\" has an awesome electric piano sound (Wurlitzer?) and some harmonica. \r\nJazzy drumming and some atmospheric, feedback-y guitar. Sounds like upright bass is being \r\nused. Some great ethereal singing here, backed by symphonic strings. \"Viorar Vel Til \r\nLoftarasa\" reminds me of Floyd's \"Great Gig In The Sky,\" except there is strings instead and no \r\nfemale vocals. Gets more Radiohead sounding when the vocals enter. The ending reminds \r\nme of Sgt. Peppers. \"Olsen Olsen\" has a very post-rocky bassline that wouldn't sound out of \r\nplace on a Mogwai or Tortoise album. More child-like ethereal vocals. Nice flute parts in this \r\nsong. Some \"la-la\" harmony vocals. \"Avalon\" is a atmospheric, moody instrumental. Nice way \r\nto end the album.<p>\r\nI was never a big fan of this group, nothing they did ever really grabbed my attention. I haven't \r\nheard all of their albums, but I enjoy this one the most of the ones I have. I've heard better post-\r\nrock and I've heard worse post-rock. I would give this a 3.5 but can't push myself to give it 4 \r\nstars. 3 stars then.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=417195#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=417195\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=417195\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, March 16, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #417195)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15928\"><strong>progrules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15928\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15928/cover_1325619920091.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSigur Ros' music has always been from another planet for me. And I'm afraid I'm a bit too \r\nmuch down to earth to understand or appreciate this kind of music. PA's guidelines expect us \r\nto remain civilized and respectful to the bands we review so I will do my very best here. Of \r\ncourse I could have stayed away from this band (or even the entire sub genre to be honest) but \r\nas I stated before I feel a prog reviewer has to reveal where he or she stands with all kinds of \r\nprog. So here we go.<p>The short intro has nothing to offer so that's already a downside. Svefn-G-Englar was the track \r\nthat gave me the shivers (but not down the spine really) first time I listened to it. Besides the \r\nfact it sounds pretty creepy I also noticed it gets repetitive halfway. The song drags on for too \r\nlong and the useless fade out last minute doesn't help either. After six minutes suddenly \r\nRadiohead comes barging in it seems but since I'm not a big fan of them either it's another \r\nminus for this first (real) song. Next up is the highly praised Star\u00e1lfur and I have to say it's \r\nindeed one of the better on this supposed masterpiece. The vocals are less annoying and the \r\nmelody is dreamy and somewhat captivating. But also here a strange ending obviously was \r\nneeded to make the song more special. Flugulfrelsarinn goes on in the same vein but sounds \r\na lot more boring to me. N\u00fd Batter\u00ed opens with weakish flute and other wind instruments. \r\nCreepy keysounds give the impression the trip in outer space continues. I can't get used to the \r\nvocals either. Jonsi's voice is probably meant to mesmerize the fans but I'm afraid it doesn't \r\nwork with me. Well, I will not go into the whole album. The tone is set, both by Sigur Ros as by \r\nme and I fear we will not be a match at any moment in time.<p>Leaves the final rating as a bit of a problem. Somehow I can hear this is a bit of a special \r\nalbum, that is if I try to be as open minded as possible. But this band's music is so extremely \r\nfar away from my musical taste and interest that two stars is the very maximum I can do (1,5). \r\nUnfortunately I have many more albums from this band because they were for sale here at that \r\nmoment so I don't exclude the possibility I will review more of their albums. I hope for the band \r\nI will not and actually I hope for myself the same ...<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=486623#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=486623\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=486623\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, July 20, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #486623)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSigur Ros' second proper album (not counting the preceding remix album) finds the band \r\nhitting on their distinctive style - a blend of majestic post-rock and ethereal vocals inspired by \r\nthe gorgeous work of the Cocteau Twins, which comes together to create the cold, shimmering \r\nsoundscapes collected on this release.

I was also drawn \r\nin by the beautiful cover art of an angelic embryo floating in a neon glow. The iconic \r\nemblematic art signifies the floating music that Sigur Ros emanate. As the album begins one is \r\nimmediately transported to the Icelandic chill of the frozen tundras. The incomprehensible \r\nlanguage adds to the mystique. The music sounds cold and distant but somehow comforting. \r\nThe album title \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" means \"A good beginning\", which is apt as it was the beginning \r\nof greatness for the band that went on to become major successes worldwide. <p>It begins with an Intro of backwards strings and synths. Then is followed by 'Svefn-G-Englar', \r\none of the more serene tracks; virtually a one note piece with very high register spaced out \r\nvocals, along streams of violins and patient measured percussion. The dreamy synths are \r\nmeandering slowly and everything slows inexorably from this track on. <p>The highlight of the album that resonated with me from first listen is 'Staralfur' with gorgeous \r\nchimes, violins, and tearful vocals. The melancholy that is built with stirring violins and organic \r\natmospherics is stunning. This is highly original music designed to touch the emptions at the \r\ndeepest level. It ends with cold static leading to the next song. <p>'Flugufrelsarinn' is a haunting soundscape adorned with ominous strings and keys. The vocals \r\nare more middle register and no less wracked in emotional longing. 'Ny Batteri' has an Oriental \r\nfeel, and features slow paced horns, a relaxed feel on keyboards, with some intense moments \r\non loud drums, that are released into pleasant calm and almost silence. The vocals are ultra \r\nhigh falsetto and sung in a laid back but beautiful melody.<p>'Hjartao Hamast (Bamm Bamm Bamm)' utilises harmonica with piano embellishments and then \r\nthe trademark vocals chime in. There is a degree of experimental work to generate unusual \r\nrather creepy atmospheres. 'Viorar Vel Til Loftarasa' begins as a distant zone of feedback \r\nloops and spacey atmospheres. The infinitely patient piano is heavenly and is joined by \r\nsymphonic strings and some psychedelic vocals. It builds to a crescendo of interlacing violins \r\nand improvised melodies that overlap and become chaotic along with sporadic drumming. <p>'Olsen Olsen' begins with distant spacey vibes on vocals and some percussion, with a repeated \r\nguitar phrase and ambience at the low end flows along. The majestic ending with multitracked \r\nchoirs and uplifting melodies is very unusual in comparison to the ambience previously. <p>'Agaetis Byrjun' has a powerful scape of uplifting beauty with piano augmentations and some \r\nscraping sounds with a moderate percussion. The chimes add to the dreaminess, and then \r\nhigh falsetto vocals mixed to the front glaze over the freezing landscape. 'Avalon' is a trip into \r\nspace with keyboards and winding ribbons of cello sounds. The exploration of ambient textures \r\nis striking and it builds until some experimental twangs are heard to end the journey.  <p>This is certainly one of the best Sigur Ros albums and may take some out of their comfort zone \r\nsuch is the starkness of the extreme ambient music. It takes a degree of patience to endure the \r\nfull 70 minute journey but makes nice dreamy relaxing music at the end of a busy day to kick \r\nback to. It is a full immersive atmospheric journey that has the power to relax the senses. The \r\nband built up a very solid fanbase from this album to present day. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=769587#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=769587\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=769587\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 12, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #769587)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16136\"><strong>LinusW</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16136\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16136/mumrik2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe sounds of wind, water and light. <p>Having dipped my toes in the world of post-rock on numerous occasions with a feeling of nothing more\r\nthan mild and polite admiration of both the musicianship and general ideas behind it, it is really\r\nrather nice that the first experience is the only one I keep coming back to. Sigur Ros and more\r\nspecifically \u00c1gaetis Byrjun: an album of meticulous, yet unkempt beauty that lifts you up and takes\r\nyou away on a lovely journey for as long as you allow yourself to be spellbound by it.<p>Being rather eclectic if you delve a bit deeper into the songs, it is first and and foremost a\r\nsupreme tour-de-force in building and cherishing atmosphere, regardless of the methods used to get\r\nthere. Despite a lot of detail and at times rather busy arrangements, what stays with me is a sense\r\nof space and a lot of room to breathe. A cool and breezy morning by the sea. The air still fresh\r\nfrom the rain during the night, with glimpses of light appearing here and there under the sullen,\r\ndeparting clouds. One reviewer described it as Nordic. Being Nordic myself, I can somewhat relate to\r\nthat, however unspecific it may be, even though I would describe the feel of the album as something\r\nmore universal. <p>Slow-to-glacial, cottony rhythmic foundation serves as the bedrock upon which soothing, gently\r\nswirling layers of ambient, moody keys and guitar make up much of the main structures, quietly\r\npainting a shifting soundscape of pale, refreshing colours. These are in turn lovingly adorned by\r\ncrisp, clear and often a bit sparse (almost percussive) melodic details from a distant guitar lick\r\nand the odd, high-pitched piano/e-piano notes. Undercurrents of bass, warm horns (or is it\r\nwoodwind?) and other goodies quietly pass by beneath. And out of the blue a sudden or gradual\r\nbuild-up of forceful, noisy and ringing guitar shoots out of the layered soundscape like a\r\nmountaintop. Awe-inspiring. <p>Sometimes it turns into a busier, more orchestral affair, again with strings, horns and piano\r\nsticking out as more defining features, in often (tastefully) bombastic and uplifting crescendos,\r\nwhere the sounds of the instruments seems to rise upwards - blending the cheerfully melancholic with\r\nthe painful smile -  in a sort of dancing motion that I find damn near irresistible.<p>Then there is the more familiar rock structures that, while slowed-down and very atmospheric, brings\r\nup the drums and bass from the back of the mix adding points of anchorage and a bit of meat to the\r\noften floating, fluffy structures on \u00c1\u0081gaetis Byrjun. There are a few instances where things even get\r\na bit jazzy, rhythmically speaking. The wall-of-sound-using-especially-guitar-trick that seems to be\r\na defining part of the sub-genre make some appearances now and then, but it is never allowed to\r\ndominate, but rather accentuates and act as a form of dynamic catalyst. To great effect, I might add. <p>Like a smoke or a mist over this invigorating mix floats vocalist J\u00f3nsi's mellow, otherworldly and\r\nvery expressive vocals, further enhanced by a touch of effects. In spite of (or perhaps because of)\r\nnever reaching for proper emotional extremes in his delivery, they blend exquisitely with the music\r\nand feel all the more meaningful and integrated with the album as a whole. <p>What still strikes me as the biggest feat here is how the album comes together as a harmonious\r\nwhole. So rich and crafted and yet so free in form and structure, so naturally evolving...\r\nIt is a very uplifting experience. Happy or cheerful are not the right words, as it is a bit too\r\nreflective and cerebral for those two. It has more to do with a strange sense of spiritual peace and\r\npurpose the album is simply overflowing with. A quiet, cleansing everyday joy that bubbles just\r\nbeneath the surface.<p>Rooted in something familiar and earthbound, expressed through sounds that fly a lot higher. <p>4 stars.<p>//LinusW</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=777332#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=777332\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=777332\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, June 25, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #777332)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter a mostly ambient debut release SIGUR ROS evolved their sound to incorporate aspects of dream\r\npop, chamber music, orchestral classical and post-rock and in the process ended up creating a unique\r\nnew type of music that would become a huge world-wide sensation. On \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" we get a strange\r\neerie, ethereal flow of sounds that really makes me think of the vast Icelandic landscapes with\r\nlifeless volcanic lava flows and drifting glaciers frosting the mountainous terrain. A music that\r\noriginates from the steaming pots of boiling earthen cauldrons that flow on in a geological time\r\nframe and one that requires a calm and serene and even meditative state of mind to encompass. <p>This music isn't quite rock although it has aspects of post-rock. We don't get any seriously\r\nenergetic drum playing until track five on 'N' batter' and it rarely shows up afterwards. It isn't\r\nquite classical, yet it is superbly orchestrated and violin, piano and bowed guitar playing are\r\naplenty throughout the album. It feels closer to dream pop, but the compositions are too complex to\r\nbe considered pop, so this could be in fact a new category of something like dream symphonic\r\npost-rock or something of the sort.<p>The lyrics are sung in both their native Icelandic as well as their artificial language Vonlenska\r\nwhich is similar to the nonsensical language used by the Cocteau Twins created to de-emphasize any\r\nlyrical meanings and simply use the voice as yet another instrument. No matter which language is\r\nused the result is an alienating yet peaceful declaration of some kind of musical celebration. At\r\ntimes it feels like this music may have even been inspired by whale songs and at other times the\r\nprogressive electronic meanderings of groups like Tangerine Dream.<p>The album begins with a backmasking effect followed by a kind of volcanic rumbling setting the stage\r\nfor a kind of slow and dripping percussion sound accompanied by an organ. This is an invitation for\r\na the addition of more instruments to find a niche on this musical landscape and slowly they creep\r\nin and out with the angelic falsetto vocals of J\u00f3nsi Birgisson finally hitting the stage to lead the\r\neerie orchestration through the sonic wilderness that sounds fragile and haunting. The whole thing\r\nreminds me of how life on Earth evolves. How it springs forth from a certain origin and then\r\nseparates, adapts and finally thriving in a hitherto unexploited niche.  SIGUR ROS does just that in\r\ntheir music where certain instruments take advantage of certain musical niches in the larger musical\r\necosystem that hadn't yet been discovered in popular music.<p>This is an album that took me a while to warm up to. Being attracted firstly to fast, heavy and\r\neclectic music, I had to divorce myself from any musical expectations and just sit back and be\r\npatient and let the music steer me while I let SIGUR ROS do the driving which is never about rushing\r\nfrom point A to point B but rather savoring all the distances in between and in the process able to\r\nflesh out possibilities on the sonicscape that are more often than not ignored by other styles of\r\nmusic that put the emphasize elsewhere. After taking the time to adapt to this strange spectral\r\nsoundscape I am astounded that the music perfectly resembles the cold, harsh and somewhat detached\r\nfeel of the vast Icelandic landscapes and even more surprised that the beauty of the music like that\r\nof the cold and desolate parts of the planet contain untold beauty that is not immediately apparent\r\nyet accessible for anyone to enjoy after a slight expectational adjustment.  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1139198#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1139198\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1139198\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, February 27, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1139198)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=22970\"><strong>Conor Fynes</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=22970\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/22970/30451_10150198165215024_781110023_13173148_4731438_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> 'Agaetis Byrjun' - Sigur Ros (81/100) </strong><p>I think I've come a long way in my appreciation for <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong>. Sometime during high school, I came across a copy of <em>Takk...</em> available for loan in a public library. For all of the great things I'd heard about the Icelandic darlings, I was pretty quickly repulsed by the all-too precious tone and childlike vibe that seemed to have worked its way into every lilting moment of music on that album. I barely made it through a single listen before setting them down for good, passing <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> off as some sort of moody <strong>Alvin and the Chipmunks</strong>-type deal. Years (and some eye-opening experience with <em>( )</em>) later, I've dived into <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> with a more enlightened set of ears. It's probably still too precious, too cutesy, and too childlike for my usual tastes, but the reasons why the album has earned such an honoured place with so many fans have not gone over my head. <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> skirt the uncommon boundary between rock and ambient music; the sweeping textures are vast and effective, and the songwriting underneath is most often inspired. I might still prefer the brooding atmosphere of <em>( )</em> over this, but the fact remains: <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> serves everything a listener could possibly want out of a <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> record.<p>Even relative to other post-rock, <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> feels incredibly ambient in the way <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> have arranged and realized it. Most post-rock bands (I'm thinking go-to staples like <strong>Godspeed</strong> and <strong>Explosions in the Sky</strong>) revel in this sort of soaring atmosphere, but there's almost always a sense of rock repertoire in the music. With <strong>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</strong>, I would hesitate to say there's even much in the way of guitar riffs. Most of the distinctive sound is brought in waves of texture, delivered by a guitar played with a bow- the sort of unconventional approach <strong>Led Zeppelin's</strong> Jimmy Page would take out during extended live solos as an intriguing novelty. With <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> especially, <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> have taken the potential of a bowed guitar to its natural conclusion. Beyond a doubt, it's the most innovative aspect <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> have in their arsenal. The bowed guitar flourishes are larger-than-life, but lack any sort of threatening edge or the grit of traditional riffs. In many cases, I'd cite non-threatening instrumentation as a bad thing. For <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong>, they wear it as an asset. And it works.<p>As is often the case for the brighter side of ambient music, the atmosphere here is one of soaring. Cheery, hopeful, redemptive feelings are awash in the midst of the indistinct guitar textures, the light string sections and pleasantly dreamy atmospherics. It's interesting (though, for many, redundant) to note that singer Jonsi vocalizes in an invented language called Vonlenska (Hopelandic, for us anglophones). Relative to the surge of positive emotions on <strong>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</strong>, it's quite a thing that the so-called lyrics are about nothing at all. I may be digressing a bit, but it says something about the nature of music when such vivid mental images are conjured when listening to songs with no set or determined meanings. Moreover, at least from my own experience as a listener, it's quite rare to hear a band take such ambitious lengths to portraying the positive side of emotion. Very often, it's the darker feelings that evoke strong artistry. Is it because happiness is seen as unworthy or shallow in the eye of the artist? I'm not sure, but to date, there haven't been many albums I've heard that, at their best moments, convey the sort of positive warmth that <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> have evoked on <strong>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</strong>.<p>It feels important, however, to stress that these grand feelings are drawn from moments, rather than <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> as a whole. There isn't filler here per se, but the album's distinctly ambient leaning can make the 70-odd minute length strain a listener's attention. For whatever reason, the album's latter act never really grips me, at least in the same way the first few tracks did. Is it because there is a true dip in quality? I don't think so. Most likely, it's because the magic of <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong>' atmosphere begins to wear off when the somnolent ambiance is pushed past the hour mark. I don't think that's a failure as a listener either; added surprises (like the quaint woodwinds melody on \"Olsen Olsen\") would have served to alleviate he increasingly lackadaisical impression. Even so, there are songs here that would have sparked my attention no matter where they were on the album. \"Star\u00e1lfur\" is an instantly lovely track, alight with piano and strings. \"Olsen Olsen\" is another nice one, with a similarly light and cheery feel to it. \"Flugufrelsarinn\" is not a world away from the rest of the album's general cheer and warmth, but compared to \"Star\u00e1lfur\" before it, it has a more mysterious, even foreboding atmosphere to it. <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> are best with arrangement and texture, but they've proven themselves to be capable songwriters as well.<p>I'm not sure why I've left the most negative thing about <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> and <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> as a whole until the last, but I also figure my general distaste for Jonsi's vocals are the most controversial(?) thing I have to say about the album. Looking back to the initial disgust I had towards <em>Takk...</em>, veyr little of it had to do with the instrumentation. Every doubt I had was pointed at Jonsi's voice, which was (and still) almost insufferably elfish and precious. Compounded with the Hopelandic lyrical angle, Jonsi's vocals aren't for everyone, and they're certainly not for me. With that said, it's rare to come across a vocalist in any genre who seems to embody their own originality so well. Jonsi's voice doesn't fill me with the joy in which others have felt, but his voice is instantly and irrefutably 'him'. No other singer is quite like Jonsi, which is certainly saying something to the band's credit.<p>With <strong>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</strong>, <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> more or less established themselves as the musical equivalent to filmmaker Wes Anderson. It's a regression to a childlike innocence and wonder most of us felt at some point, and ultimately grew past. I've heard this childlike atmosphere in music before (I much prefer the way <strong>maudlin of the Well</strong> does it) but in that and so many other things, <strong>Sigur R\u00f3s</strong> have, in their own little way, found a slight slice of perfection. It does not have the dramatic intensity of <em>( )</em>, nor do I find my heart infiltrated by it the way I'd expect from a considered masterpiece or favourite album, but <em>\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun</em> has altogether earned its place in the post-rock canon. Beautiful, it is.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1288422#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1288422\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1288422\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 6, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=7344#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1288422)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=27874\"><strong>TCat</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=27874\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/27874/4150874369_330_1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis would be the album that would bring Sigur Ros out of obscurity not only in their own country of Iceland, but in the entire \r\nworld.  Hard to believe that a band that sings only in their native tongue and also in another made-up language would be so \r\npopular in America also, but this band proved that it can happen.  This was only the band's 2nd full album, but it is so \r\ninnovative and beautiful, so well produced, that you would swear these were well seasoned musicians. These feats in and of \r\nthemselves tell a lot about the artists involved, but it is only a huge plus that this album is one of the most beautiful \r\nexperiences in modern music today.<p>People like to compare them to Pink Floyd, but there is no comparison to any band.  The techniques they use are unique, like \r\nusing a cello bow on guitar strings and then adding reverb to create atmosphere.  And this album is completely full of \r\natmosphere and emotion.  When I listen to it, I marvel how some of this music is even earthly possible.  It approaches celestial \r\nstatus at times, lifting you above everything.  It is also very immersive music in that to fully appreciate it, you have to immerse \r\nyourself and really listen.  There is so much going on even at regular levels, but also in many underlying passages.  But you \r\ndon't have to always be immersed to hear it's beauty.  For example, the 3rd track \"Staralfer\", when I first listened to this \r\nalbum, I was not really immersed into it, but the beauty of the orchestration and musicianship pulled me in instantly.  Just as \r\nanother reviewer has mentioned, this album can bring you to tears, and this is one track that does it.  It's hard to believe that \r\nthe topic of the track is a child's fairy tale about a staring elf, but that is why I think it is important that the lyrics can't be \r\nunderstood, because it leaves that track and every song by the band open to complete interpretation.  You can paint your \r\nown pictures in your mind.<p>But, the amazingness of the music isn't just limited to that track.  It starts off with an \"intro\" which is simply the title track \r\n(Number 8) played backwards.  But it prepares you for \"Svefn-g-englar\" which is also a lovely song, where the lyrics are \r\nrepeated often, but the lyrics and the vocals are just instruments in the entire band.  The birthing process through the \r\nperspective of a new born is the topic of the song.  The use of the bow on guitar strings is used well in this song to increase \r\nvolume and emotion of the track.  Then the beautiful and heavily orchestrated \"Staralfer\" comes next and words can't express \r\nthe emotion in this track.  I love how the orchestra builds while Jonsi sings and then just drops off to what sounds like an \r\nelectric guitar that is not plugged in to an amp being strummed while he continues to sing.   An interesting side note here is \r\nthat the strings in this track are palandromic, or the same forward and backward.  I also find the track \" Hjarta\u00f0 Hamast \r\n(bamm Bamm Bamm)\" extremely interesting and amazing, with totally unique sounds and textures, and at times copying the \r\nsound of a hammering heart, as is hinted in the title.  Throughout the album, there is such an effective use of dynamics, and \r\nthat is very relevant in this track.  <p>\"Vi\u00f0rar Vel Til Loft\u00e1rasa\" is probably the closest song to a Pink Floyd type sound.  It has a very long introduction which \r\nfeatures a solo piano and an orchestra crescendo-ing  and then a sliding guitar sound very reminiscent of Pink Floyd joins in \r\nvery tastefully.  Then vocals finally start, remaining somewhat subdued and far away this time, but the instruments still swell \r\nand ebb around the vocals.  The effect is amazing.  Then suddenly, there is that huge sound of the treated guitar and bow \r\nagain, and it is joined by strings which eventually drown everything else out as it builds and tempo and pitch are sped up.  \r\nThen it drops off suddenly and flows into the familiar drum beat and bass line of \"Olsen Olsen\".   This is another beaut of a \r\nsong.  The far off voice starts sounding like Jonsi is singing from a distance, like from a distant canyon.  And that flute melody \r\nthat comes in from time to time is perfect.  It gives the track a definite Celtic feel.  When that melody comes back, it is played \r\nby the piano with strings chugging underneath, and then joined by the band and the orchestra and chorus.  Love the jubilant \r\nfeel of this one.  As brass joins in, things get slightly disjointed and dissonant as it fades out.  Before the track is over, you hear \r\nthe flute far away in the distance.  The title track is more acoustic sounding and is probably more of a traditional love ballad \r\nsound, but lovely nonetheless.   There is still enough ingenuity in this track to keep it interesting.  The song is fragile sounding, \r\nlike it is likely to go wandering off into non-traditional territory at any time, but something continues to keep it restrained to \r\nit's boundaries.  Everything is finished off with \"Avalon\", which is simply the strings section and the strumming section \r\nfrom \"Staralfer\" slowed down to about 1/4 of the original speed, and sounding rather muffled.  It serves as an ambient ending \r\nto the album.<p>When you listen to this album, you can see why it was so well received everywhere in the world and also lauded by critics.  It is \r\nan amazing album, which strongly proves that Progressive Rock is alive and well.  This is a definite masterpiece, though it is \r\nnot universally accepted by all prog-heads, there is no denying that if you let yourself into this music, that it is simply \r\namazing.
