I don't know if I \r\nwould go that far but this one is really great indeed. Again, we see Maiden at top \r\nperformance and songwriting like featured on the \"Somewhere In Time\", including melodic \r\nsongs (\"The Prophecy\") to more wild and complex epics (the title track). A very dynamic \r\nand well-balanced album in overall I would say. Continuing the epic and progressive steps \r\nleft after 1986's \"Somewhere In Time\", though \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" is a bit \r\nmore earthly, you can clearly see here that Maiden has found a path which they would \r\nwalk further on. Sadly, they didn't until after the \"Fear of The Dark\" album released in \r\n1992, and thus with not so perfect results as this album was. \"Seventh Son of a Seventh \r\nSon\" also represents Maiden's first true concept album, inspired by Orson Scott Card's \r\nnovel with the same name. The title track especially presents this fact well. <p>Of course, this is not a perfect album, some less good musical parts are present, but it still \r\nkeep's up with \"Powerslave\" and \"Somewhere In Time\" with complete ease, this was my \r\nfavourite Maiden album until I realized that those two were slightly better. But I would still \r\nstrongly recommend this album to all who are interested. The album sold well and got \r\nsupported with 4 singles, all being excellent musically, making this album to one of Maiden's \r\nmost memorable albums from the 80's. <p>A near-masterpiece overall with the best tracks being \"Moonchild\", the excellent title track \r\n(one of Maiden's best tracks in their career) and \"The Prophecy\". Highly recommended. \r\n4.55/5\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93083#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93083\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93083\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93083)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI don't remember exactly if \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" or \"Powerslave\" was the \r\nthird CD I purchased from Iron Maiden albums. But for sure this is another excellent\r\nmusic produced by Iron Maiden. From its powerful opening track \"Moonchild\" to \"Only\r\nthe Good Die Young\" this album delivers a well balanced music of good melody and\r\nharmony. \"Moonchild\" has very strong composition in relatively fast tempo and\r\npowerful vocal line and melody. It's hard to deny that this is an excellent hard rock\r\nmusic with some prog elements in it. \"Infinite Dreams\" starts with soft guitar work\r\nthat reminds me to classic rock music followed with medium tempo style accompanying\r\nvocal. It moves in crescendo into heavier music with high register notes voice line.\r\nAgain the multi guitar players work collaboratively to deliver excellent harmony. The\r\nsong moves in relatively varied style. It's a great song. I like how bass guitar\r\nplayed by Steve Harris move along with the music and providing definitive and tight\r\nbass lines. Bravo Steve Harris! Structurally, you might consider this as a prog music.<p>\"Can I Play With Madness\" is somewhat remembering me to Kansas' \"Carry On Wayward\r\nSon\" because the opening choir line is similar in nature. It's one of accessible\r\nsongs that many people can enjoy. \"The Evil That Men Do\" brings melodic part at the\r\nopening through soft guitar work followed with straight hard rock music. It's hard to\r\ndeny that the album title track is completely a prog music in nature. Look at the\r\nnon-linear structure and sound textures with symphonic style. \"Seventh Son of a\r\nSeventh Son\" is a beautifully crafted song combining excellent melody, textures,\r\nharmony and powerful singing style. It's also the case with \"The Prophecy\" and \"The\r\nClairvoyant\" - both tracks are excellent and have become the band's legendary tracks.\r\nThe album concludes brilliantly with \"Only The Good Die Young\" (Is it to say that to\r\nDie Old you have to be cruel and nasty?) in relatively straight hard rock music.<p>Overall, this is a masterpiece of rock. Some people who love Iron Maiden said that\r\nthis is the proggiest album of Iron Maiden. Is it? It's up to you to decide. One\r\nthing for sure, if you are a rocker you would definitely say that this is a\r\nmasterpiece! <strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93732#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93732\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93732\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 8, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93732)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5630\"><strong>darkshade</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5630\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5630/zappa_1988_color_480.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden's shining moment. Almost every reviewer has given this 4-5 stars. And \r\nrightfully so, as this is probably one of, if not, THE blueprint for future prog-metal acts \r\nas well as some other prog bands. From the opening of Moonchild, through probably \r\nMaiden's most prog track, right to the end with Only The Good Die Young, not a single \r\nmoment is boring.<p>Moonchild, Can I Play With Madness, and Only The Good Die Young are standard \r\nMaiden tracks, though more epic and proggy than usual. Great melodies and harmonies \r\nas always, they're just above average tunes, by the band's standards.<p>Infinite Dreams, The Evil That Men Do, The Prophecy, and The Clairvoyant are 4 of the \r\nbest tracks Maiden ever laid to an album, and some of the proggiest. They evoke many \r\nemotions, some sad, some joyous, some triumphant, all very powerful. Dickinson's \r\nvocals are absolutely top notch as he hits some of the highest notes in his career. The \r\nguitars mixed with the suttle keyboards are the dominating force in the music, with \r\nHarris' bass and McBrain's drums holding everything together. Infinite Dreams goes \r\nthrough many different tones in the music, and if you listen on headphones closely, \r\nthere's parts you wouldnt necessarily hear normally. The Evil That Men Do is standard \r\nMaiden in terms of composition, but the melodies are so captivating and emotional that \r\nit ranks higher than another 'normal' Maiden tune. The Prophecy has a nice 6/8 time \r\nthat has good bass and suttle keyboards. The highlight of the track is easily the \r\nclassical guitar outro. It's so beautiful and captivating that I sometimes wish it were its \r\nown song. That end section hints at what would come later in Maiden's career (BNW, \r\nDOD, AMOLOD). The Clairvoyant, a Maiden live staple, is also probably the second best \r\ntrack on the album. You can hear where the likes of Dream Theater, Symphony X, \r\nUmphrey's McGee, etc. got a lot of their inspiration from here. From the grand opening, \r\nto the dark verses, to the excellent solo section, it's all here.<p>The 'piece-de-resistance' is, of course, the title track. This pretty much set the \r\nstandard for the most part of how a prog-metal song should be like. The first 4 minutes \r\nor so are completely epic Maiden with good singalong vocals and lush keyboards. Then \r\nthe song slows down to a haunting melody with the bass and drums in some interesting \r\ntime signature, something like 17/18 or something, im not quite sure right now. \r\nDickinson reads a section of the lyrics in a very dark tone, almost scary. The guitars \r\nstart building up, as does everyone else eventually until a very climatic section comes \r\nand you think the song is over, but it's barely begun.<p>What comes next is, in my honest opinion, Maiden's heaviest section they've ever \r\ndone. Forget anything on A Matter of Life and Death, this is the heaviest thing they've \r\never done. The riffs are have a strange exotic feel to them, but very good. The final \r\noutro has some excellent melodies and brings the song home leaving the listener out of \r\nbreath when it's all over.<p>This album cannot be beat, unfortunately I feel Maiden will never top this album again, \r\nsince this album is the buildup of 6 albums past. It's a damn shame this lineup would \r\nnever exist again (sort of, just with one extra guitarist, who I feel is unnecessary to \r\nkeep in the band, but I digress)<p>Although under prog-related, this album comes as the exception and should at least be \r\nin every prog lover's collection.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93784#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93784\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93784\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 8, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93784)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8096\"><strong>Tarcisio Moura</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8096\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/8096/unspoken_Whisper.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAlthough it was surrounded by controversy at the time it was released, this is\r\nclearly Iron Maiden's biggest achievement. The reason it was not that well greeted in\r\nthe 80's is basic because it was such a groundbreaking album, it was hard to\r\npredict how much it would affect the course of the music scene. This was the truly\r\nfirst \"prog metal\" album ever. Somewhere In time hinted much a couple of years\r\nbefore, but Seventh Son Of a Seventh Son was really the one that proved progressive\r\nmusic and heavy metal were not incompatible at all. More than that it proved that\r\nboth genres could combined to from a whole new style. Up till then no band  had gone\r\nas far as Maiden to develop their sound so much in such a short span of time. Some did\r\nchanged a lot, but as far as going commercial, or maybe more aggressive, but Maiden did\r\noutgrow their style boundaries.<p>But enough of history here. The album is remarkable not only for its novelty at the time.\r\nIt's the sheer quality of the songs that really makes this a enjoyable, timeless,\r\npiece of music. All tracks are strong (varying from classic to very good) and definitely\r\nit marked the peak of the creativeness of all band members, but specially Steve\r\nHarris. No wonder this LP is one of his favourites.  Songs like Infinite\r\nDreams, The Evil that Man Do and The Clairvoyant are as relevant today as they were\r\nback then. The band is playing better than ever and the very good Maiden England video\r\nshowed that on stage.<p>The only bad feeling about this album was the fact that never again the band could\r\nmatch this feat. Adrian Smith would soon leave the band and all would go downhill\r\nfrom that point on. But, after producing some of the finest HM albums of the entire\r\n80's and pointing the future more than once, I guess they did more than most bands\r\never dreamed of. It would be asking too much for anyone to be forever leading trends.\r\nTheir latest albums may not have the power and freshness of Seventh Son... or even the ones that came before it, but they\u00b4re still Maiden albums and the progressive elements only\r\nincreased after Brave New world (which always sound to me as a kind of progression of\r\nthe Seven Son... music). <p>A classic, a trendsetter, one of my favourites albums of all time. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93966#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93966\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93966\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 10, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93966)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8266\"><strong>Melomaniac</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8266\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070809_163315_cover_183172332.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs one of the most fervent militants of Iron Maiden's inclusion in PA (along with Ghost \r\nRider), I feel that, now that justice is done, I must review Iron Maiden's brilliant \r\ncareer.  It is no coincidence that I choose 7th Son as my first Iron Maiden review, as it \r\nwas the first IM album I bought upon it's release and also my favorite, the most prog \r\nalbum they recorded (along with A Matter of Life and Death) and the only true concept \r\nalbum they have recorded.<p>In a time when it was unthinkable to add synths into metal, Iron Maiden have to be \r\ngiven the credit to have been the first metal band to do so with Somewhere in Time, \r\nand it paid off.  With 7th Son, they pushed the daring even further, opening the album \r\non acoustic guitar and vocals in the introduction to Moonchild.  A hard-hitting opener, \r\ndark, heavy and fast-paced, with Bruce Dickinson delivering one of his most theatrical \r\nperformance.  'Infinite Dreams' is truly a prog-metal (master)piece, from it's mellow \r\nintroduction to it's heavy and complex instrumental section.  The build up is just \r\nphenomenal.  The way this song is built never fails to amaze me.  'Can I play with \r\nMadness' is the album's top single, and, even though it probably is my least favorite \r\ntrack on this album, I have to recognize that it is catchy and has wonderful melodies.  \r\nThere's something about this song that instantly grabs you, and first thing you notice is \r\nyou are tapping your foot along the infectious groove.  'The Evil that Men Do' is a more \r\nstandard metal track, not unlike Moonchild.  Very great tune.<p>Next comes the masterpiece of the album, and one of Iron Maiden's best songs (in my \r\nhumble opinion), the title track Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  A prog metal fan's \r\ndelight.  The atmosphere in this song is very ethereal in a dark way.  Dickinson's \r\nperformance in this song is top notch.  The middle section makes you want to hold your \r\nbreath as it is so eerie, building into a climactic ending.  'The Prophecy' is the only song \r\nDave Murray penned on this album, and it stands out.  A mid-tempo rocker with an \r\namazing acoustic guitar finale.  'The Clairvoyant' has that typical Maiden flavor, \r\ninstantly recognizable upon the first seconds, driven by Harris' soaring bass line with his \r\nunique tone.  Undoubtedly a classic.  Album closer 'Only the Good Die Young' ends the \r\nalbum perfectly, as if it was written for the purpose of ending the album (which \r\nprobably was the case).  'The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at \r\nnight...' ... I get chills when I hear that line.  Harris has a moment where he particularly \r\nshines, delivering and interesting and fast melody in E while Murray and Smith hold the \r\nrythm for him.  The song ends in an explosing finale, before returning to the intro of \r\nMoonchild 'Seven Deadly sins, seven ways to win, seven holy paths to hell...'.  The \r\nperfect end to a perfect album.<p>Unfortunately, 7th Son would be Adrian Smith's last album before returning on Brave \r\nNew World.<p>Fans of prog not really into Iron Maiden should waste no time in discovering this \r\namazing album, as it would demonstrate to them just how prog the Mighty Iron Maiden \r\ncan be.<p>A masterpiece of the genre, deserving an undisputable five stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94428#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94428\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=94428\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, October 13, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #94428)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9486\"><strong>Cristi</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Crossover / Prog Metal Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9486\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/9486/12032204_10153127475862308_2338569412835506363_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n    Seventh Son of the Seventh Son is the first Iron Maiden  album I listened to in\r\nvery late 80s, i was just a teenager. It impressed me big time and thus, IM has\r\nbecome one of my favourite bands. \r\n   \r\n   As with the previous album - Somewhere in Time - the use of keyboards continues,\r\nstill greatly and cleverly. The title track is a brilliant epic, one of the best\r\nMaiden songs ever. Again, i'll have to say there are no filler tracks here, even the\r\naccessible Can I Play with Madness works nicely. The highlights of the album are\r\nInfinite Dreams, Clairvoyant, The Evil that Men Do, The Prophecy and the title song.\r\nMoonchild is a great opener and also Only the Good Die Young closes the album nicely\r\ngiving the impression of a concept album. <p>   This album is a must-have for all prog-rock and prog-metal fans.

After this excellent and\r\nambitious album, they just started declining in quality, with 4 somewhat weak albums\r\nuntil Brave New World was released. This is a concept album, and while it does not\r\nconnect musically as well as Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" and any Neal Morse solo album,\r\nit is still a very enjoyable set of songs with some musical ideas that are shared\r\namong songs here. This album also shows Iron Maiden attempting to sound more\r\nsymphonic, with the help of keyboards.<p>Introduced by an acoustic motif and electric keyboards, <strong> Moonchild </strong> is among\r\nIron Maiden's best opening songs in an album. An irresistible fast-paced rocker with\r\nvery memorable choruses (check out the guitar riff in them) and brazing guitar\r\nplaying. The energy and arrangements make Moonchild a highlight of this great album.\r\n<strong> Infinite Dreams </strong> is a synth-heavy (for Maiden) complex tune with tempo\r\nchanges. A very solid composition that is a favorite among many Iron Maiden fans.\r\n<strong> Can I Play With Madness </strong> is an upbeat song that sounds quite out of place in\r\nthis dark album. The quality of the song doesn't help also, being possibly as\r\nannoying as \"Die With Your Boots On\" and \"Running Free\". <strong> The Evil That Men Do\r\n</strong> is a more straightforward song, but it does not mean that it is weak. It's\r\nriffs, chorus vocal melodies, and solos are enough to stop it from being a low point\r\nin the album.<p><strong> Seventh Son of a Seventh Son </strong> is the best song of the album, even better than\r\nthe wonderful Moonchild. Not only that, but it may also be my 3rd favourite song in\r\nthe entire discography of Iron Maiden, behind The Trooper and Paschendale. The track\r\nstarts with a guitar melody that will later appear faster-paced in the closing track.\r\nGreat melodic verses and heavy and faster-paced choruses make the first half of the\r\nsong excellent. Check the drumming in this song, it is one of McBrain's shining\r\nmoments. After the second chorus, a nice guitar line is repeated until it abruptly\r\nstops and a mellow, yet fast-paced atmospheric section with bass, guitars, synths,\r\npercussion, and narration. Later, you hear vocal chorus and soft and echoed electric\r\nguitar riffs. It starts growing and growing until it turns into metal again. This\r\nmellow section is absolutely brilliant and is what\" Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"\r\nfailed to achieve. Now, there is metal with excellent and virtuosic guitar soloing\r\nand more epic vocal chorus, ending the song with possibly the heaviest section of\r\nmusic Iron Maiden has ever done.<p><strong> The Prophecy </strong> is another excellent song in the vein of Infinite Dreams, with\r\ntempo changes, and somewhat complex and inspired songwriting. I love the ending when\r\nthe electric guitar riff fades out and an elegant acoustic guitar solo plays for a\r\nminute. <strong> The Clairvoyant </strong>and <strong> Only The Good Die Young </strong> are simplier\r\nfast-paced metal songs that are more anthemic and seem like good choices on a live\r\nsetlist.<p>All in all, Iron Maiden's greatest artistic achievement is here and after this album,\r\nthey will release a very weak and uninspired \"No Prayer for the Dying\", an ok, but\r\ndisappointing \"Fear of the Dark\" which at least has a great title track, an\r\nexperimental but somewhat dull \"X-Factor\" with a bad singer, and a total disaster\r\n\"Virtual XII\" until they finally started releasing good quality albums again.<p>Anyways, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys good music and a bit of metal.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104750#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104750\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=104750\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 28, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #104750)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11104\"><strong>1800iareyay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son would prove to be the last album of Maiden's classic era. \r\nAfter the slight experimentation with synths on the preceeding Somewhere in Time, the \r\nband decided to embrace guitar synths for their next album, a concept piece dealing \r\nwith a young psychic who forsees an apocalyptic future and attempts to warn the \r\npeople in his village, who ignore him. This is sort of like a power metal version of the \r\nGreek story of Cassandra who foresaw the downfall of Troy but could not convince her \r\ncountrymen to flee. This isn't Maiden's best album from a metal standpoint, but from a \r\nprog view this is the apex of Maiden's career.<p>This, like all Maiden albums from Powerslave to Somewhere in Time, contains no filler \r\ntracks. From the rocking opener \"Moonchild\" to the anthemic \"Only the Good Die \r\nYoung,\" this album never loses its concept and it is pure prog metal. \"Can I Play With \r\nMadness?\" is the striaght-forward single of the album, but it's highly adictive and \r\ndoesn't subtract from the seriousness of the album.<p>Every musician works together on this stunning landmark in prototypical progressive \r\nmetal. Nicko McBrain is a very inventive drummer who never gets the recognition that \r\nSteve, Adrian, Dave, and Bruce do. Though not nearly as technical as a Bobby \r\nJarzombeck or a Dave Lombardo or a Gene Hoglan, his bass drums complement Steve's \r\nrythm, and his cymabl and snare workouts make him one of the most well-rounded \r\ndrummers in metal. Adrian and Dave craft superb passages that work in tandem and \r\nalso let one player solo while the other forges ahead with a new melody. Bruce's vocals \r\nare stunning as usual. I view Steve as the John Entwistle of meta; both manage to \r\nunleash amazing bass performances while still keeping to the rythm and not breaking \r\nthe songs to solo. <p>Every track is killer, but the standouts are The Clairvoyant, The Evil That Men Do, \r\nMoonchild, and the stunning title track, with its haunting yet catchy singalong chorus \r\nand one of the greatest solos in metal, though not as good as the one found on the \r\ntitle track of Powerslave. <p>Maiden was a pioneer of synths in metal. Judas Priest incorporated synths into their \r\nalbum \"Turbo,\" which was released around the time of this album and its predecessor. \r\nHowever, Priest failed to expand their sound or their fanbase as the album bordered on \r\npop and fans hated it. Maiden succeeds with this album because instead of backing off, \r\nthey crafted one of, if not their heaviest album. Fans of prog metal must own this \r\nalbum. It is not the first prog metal album, but it one of the first and helped to forge \r\nthe sub-genre along with Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime, Rage For Order, and \r\nThe Warning, Watchtower Energetic Disassembly, and Fates Warning's Awaken the \r\nGuradian. Proggies can live without this, but metal fans must own this album. Highly \r\nRecommended.<p>Progressive Grade: B+<p>Metal Grade: A-/A</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=105622#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=105622\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=105622\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 4, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #105622)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1003\"><strong>chessman</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1003\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/eye_storm.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHaving just bought this yesterday, along with Somewhere In Time, for the princely sum of \r\n\u00a310 the two, it has brought back happy memories.

Without a \r\ndoubt, it may actually be their most <em>progressive</em>, but is it really their best \r\nrecord ever? In our opinion, it's almost there. <p> After the excellent, almost perfect SOMEWHERE IN TIME, Maiden continued to travel \r\nin that same more complex, progressive road. If the preceding album had a few \r\nmoments of full-blown progressiveness, SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON is almost a \r\n100% pure prog-metal release, as the textures get even more developed, the songs \r\nare longer, multi-sectional, the guitar arrangements are more challenging, the bass \r\nlines even more virtuosic, and even the lyrics, the theme itself gets \"proggier\", as for \r\nthe first time ever, The Beast unleash what could be called a concept album. The guitar \r\nsynth, the inclusion of which enhanced the preceding album so much, plays a big role \r\nhere, too. <p> An element that I have to talk about is Bruce Dickinson's vocals: they've always been \r\ngreat, that's no news, but in this record they are really at their peak. SEVENTH SON \r\nfeatures probably the best vocal performance <strong>ever</strong> by the flyer-singer, and \r\nthat's quite a lot to say. That helps the album a lot and launches it to the top group of \r\nall the band's releases. <p> Moonchild (9.5/10) Dickinson opens this furious track singing softly over an acoustic \r\nguitar. Some spacey arpeggios mark the entrance of the whole band. It's a fast track, \r\nbut an unusual complex opener by The Beast. The bass just throttles all over with its \r\npower, while Dickinson delivers, simply <em>delivers.</em> A great, virtuosic instrumental \r\nsection where everybody shines takes this great opener (another one) to an end. <p> Infinite Dreams (9/10) A high guitar solos over the elegant bass and her quiet sister-\r\naxe. A melodic section where Dickinson shows his subtlety and the guitars sound almost \r\natmospheric and classy takes us to chorus in a different rhythm, a chorus that seems to \r\ntry to reach higher, to climb, though slowly, peacefully. Great drumming by McBrain and \r\nthe vocals by Dickinson are top-class. Halfway down we get a section in the \r\npurest \"Maiden-tempo\". Very good song. <p> Can I Play With Madness (9/10) The production is just crystal-clear, we hear \r\neverything. This song, one of the most popular in this album, is strangely in a high \r\nmood, almost happy. It has a catchy chorus where the guitar riff sounds so full of \r\nhope, it's contagious. The instrumental section is a good one, though not as inspired. \r\nAnother very good song. A little awkward in this album but good nevertheless. <p> The Evil That Men Do (9/10) A very melodic lament by the guitars leads the way to \r\nanother full-strength section where the bass just dominates in our ears with its weight. \r\nA very fast track, I love the verse and the pre-chorus (I love songs with pre-choruses) \r\nbut the chorus is not as glorious as it could've been. Anyway, that doesn't harm the \r\nsong that much, as the solo section makes up for it. Excellent. <p> Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (9.5/10) Probably one of the most progressive songs by \r\nthe Beast, it's also one of their longest at almost 10 minutes. It starts with ceremony, \r\nwith pomp, very melodic yet very imposing. The chorus is not that great, but this song \r\nis not about choruses. We get another one of those \"chant\" moments by Maiden when \r\nwe feel like we should be in an stadium singing along. The guitar synth plays its role \r\nhere. A descending figure opens the brilliant instrumental section, one of the best of \r\nthe Beast. Dickinson still has a chance to speak, though he literally does that, \r\n<em>speak</em>, over very soft bass and guitars and synth. The hi-hat and the bass \r\ndrum maintain the tension, keep it at a livable level, don't let it explode. The tension \r\nfinally reaches a climax and the fast section attacks with thundering solos by Murray \r\nand Smith. Fantastic song, one of the highlights of the album.  <p> The Prophecy (8/10) A very soft, melodic dialogue between the guitars and the bass. \r\nThe main verse strikes us as royal, kingly, arrogant. The chorus lacks a little of melody \r\nbut what surrounds it makes up for it. Another good song, though my least favorite in \r\nthis album, as it lacks a hook. It just seems to go and go.  <p> The Clairvoyant (9.5/10) Another anthemic start by The Beast, one that sends shivers \r\ndown the spine to every Iron Maiden fan, as it sounds 100% pure Maiden. Full of \r\nenergy, blood at top pressure, the main verse epic, heroic, the relentless rhythm \r\nspeaks of a battle, a lost battle, but a battle that will continue anyway, a chant for \r\nnever giving up. Unlike other Maiden tracks, this one doesn't need a glorious chorus as \r\nthe verse is already there. The chorus is actually doubtful, ambiguous, deception \r\ncollides with resignation, but then again, all the rest is pure effort, pure fight, pure \r\nsweat, guts for glory. Dickinson conveys so good every emotion in this album. This is \r\nhis album, too. <p> Only The Good Die Young (9/10) An unusual fast conclusion for a Maiden album, this \r\ntracks has the usual power and adrenaline that we've came to starve from the Beast. \r\nThe chorus starts weakly but then goes up in key and gets better. A perfect choice for \r\ncloser, it makes us leave this experience with another smile in our faces, not a new \r\nachievement by Maiden. Dickinson puts an end to the record the same way it started. <p> All in all, my third-favorite album by Iron Maiden, and another one that deserves a full \r\nrating. Even if I don't have as many favorite tracks in here as in SOMEWHERE IN TIME, \r\nthe quality of the music is at the same level, and being that we're in a progressive rock \r\nwebsite, this is the album that needs to get a 5/5 rating the most, as it's the culmination \r\nof their advances towards a more complex style of metal. They would have quite a halt \r\nfrom that in their next release, curiously their first without guitar master Adrian Smith. \r\nBut eventually, they would resurrect. That will be matter for a next review. <p> Recommended for: Fans of Iron Maiden, of Heavy Metal (the best there is), fans of \r\nprogressive metal that want to hear one of the first examples of the genre.<p> .1988 was the year when the band reached their peak. Luckily for us, there was \r\nanother peak to climb to in the future, quite a few years later, and with another singer. \r\nBut from the classic-era, SEVENTH SON and SOMEWHERE IN TIME are the Best of the \r\nBeast. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126876#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126876\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=126876\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 26, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #126876)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Seventh heaven</strong><p>Released in 1988, Iron Maiden's seventh studio album finds them very much at the top of their game. There is focus on strong \r\nmelodies here which can perhaps be lacking elsewhere in their extensive catalogue.<p>\"Seventh son..\" is a concept album telling the story of a prophet with special powers who predicts a terrible evil befalling his village. \r\nHe is not taken seriously, and ends up killing himself (\"Only the good die young\"). The tale is very similar to that adopted by the band \r\nHOME on their fine concept album \"The alchemist\". The concept however is not particularly important to the album, which is made up \r\nof eight separate tracks each of which stands alone. While we have the more traditional Iron Maiden fare in songs such as \"Can I \r\nplay with the madness\" and \"The evil that men do\", other tracks show a willingness to experiment and deviate from the band's \r\ncomfort zone.<p>The 10 minute title track is an epic power metal ballad with a symphonic arrangement. It leans heavily on synthesisers for the \r\nunderlying structure to this anthemic delight. The track has a distinctly prog feel, complete with a spoken section, and a tension \r\nbuilding chorale. <p>\"Infinite dreams\" is also built around prog nuances, the bolero like feel being at odds with the style usually associated with Iron \r\nMaiden. Tracks such as \"The prophesy\" and \"The clairvoyant\" are also constructed using intricacies which may not at first be \r\napparent, the former ending with some delicate acoustic guitar.<p>\"Seventh son or a seventh son\" is a an excellent album by any standards. It serves to demonstrate that prog metal does not need \r\nto be a sub-genre in isolation, but can appeal to a wide cross section of prog fans. The album artwork by Derek Riggs is superb, \r\nspoilt only by the fact that the LP does not have a gatefold sleeve.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=129771#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=129771\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=129771\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, July 22, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #129771)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12519\"><strong>SoundsofSeasons</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12519\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12519/muppet_animal.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nA fantastic showing of what metal can really do. I don't believe it is prog per-se but it definitely tries to lightly touch on prog. So, \r\nyes, prog fans can still enjoy this very much but expect to have fun more than anything. You wont be blown away but you will have \r\na good time listening to it, as long as you don't expect anything too proggy. What really suprised \r\nme is that even when a song died down, it was still going strong and with tremendous fury and momentum. Wierd. Plus Bruce's voice \r\njust gets inside your head, and its fun to see what he can do once he's taken over. I just sit there and smile when he sings cause it \r\nreally is comical how good he is at sounding demonized or possesed, and of course in the best way possible. Fun licks, fun singer, \r\nyou can listen to it with anyone. Especially those OTHER hard rockin' snobs who turn their noses at the smell of prog. Unfortunately, once again, this really isn't very proggy so even what is IMHO the most prog and probably best Iron Maiden album can only get a 'good' from me. <p>3 stars, a good addition to a prog collection.

The composition and \r\nsongwriting is smarter and more dynamic than ever before, while the band's performances seem to have been touched by the \r\nFormless One himself.  \"Seventh Son\" is highly regarded as Maiden's most \"progressive\" album, and it's hard to argue with that \r\nstatement given concepts and almost reserved and classy playing; the band clearly has something more in mind than simply wowing \r\nthe listener with endless solos and Bruce's stratospheric vocals.  Lyrically, \"Seventh Son\" is fantasy inspired but still very smart, and \r\nthe inclusion of synthesizers opens up new avenues for the band's sound.  For those nay-sayers who roll their eyes at the thought \r\nof Iron Maiden being anything other than big, dumb butt-rock than this would be the album to prove them wrong; for those hooked \r\nby the excellence of other albums or interested in starting from scratch... this is a great place to begin.  <p>Songwriting 4\r\nInstrumental Performances 4\r\nLyrics/Vocals 5\r\nStyle/Emotion/Replay 5</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=131412#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=131412\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=131412\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, August 2, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #131412)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11631\"><strong>Windhawk</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11631\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11631/lpvet2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBy 1988 british heavy metal band Iron Maiden had firmly established themselves as one of the major bands, perhaps even THE\r\nmajor band, in the heavy metal scene. Their seventh studio release; \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" is the last of what most\r\nwould say are the classic Iron Maiden albums. It is a release loved by many and hated by some, and showed a band moving on\r\nfrom heavy metal to something else. A move that would be abruptly stopped after this release, sadly.<p>Musically Iron Maiden continues the transition they started with \"Powerslave\" and further explored on Somehwere in Time. The\r\ninfluences from progressive rock are if not stronger then at least easier recognizable on this release. The songs are more\r\ncomplex; with changes in style and tempo more radical than on past releases; the synth is more extensivly used on this\r\nrelease; and is a vital aspect of the soundscapes in many songs here. \r\nIn addition, the guitars are toned down making the music as such less \"heavy\" than before, and the individual instruments are\r\nused to create nuances and subtle moods quite a lot on this album.<p>The overall sound of most songs on this release are still heavy metal though, Maiden's by now typical fast paced drums, fast\r\npaced bass, pacey riffing varied with drawn out riffs, and the melodic and harmonic soloing are still very much present; but\r\nthey are now used with in a slightly changed musical context; where progressive rock now seems to be the main influence.<p>But as with their previous release \"Somewhere in Time\" this evolved sound can only do so much with songs that aren't top\r\nnotch. Although lyrically fitting within the concept story on this album; there are quite a few songs on this release that\r\nreally doesn't manage to inspire. And even on the better songs, there are parts that deducts rather than adds to the overall\r\nquality of the song.<p>Still, there are quite a few good tracks on this release; tracks that are on par with he best Maiden wrote a few years\r\nearlier. On a varied release, my personal highlight is the title track; which in itself is almost a good enough reason to buy\r\nthis release.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=136345#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=136345\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=136345\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, September 5, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #136345)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8691\"><strong>Flucktrot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8691\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070908_201329_joshuatree.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nMaiden really are doing \r\nprogressive metal here--something that wasn't immediately apparent.  However, while other former metal tunes (Judas Priest, for \r\nexample) get stale and cliche very quickly, I am really surprised about how often I come back to this one.  In addition, it's always \r\ndifferent features that grab my attention: a new appreciation for a well-worded lyric, an impressive baseline, cool guitar harmonies, \r\nand of course Dickinson's over-the-top vocal interpretations.  I even love the cover: cartoon skulls and body parts with a \r\ngruesomeness worthy of metal, yet landscapes somewhat similar to Roger Dean-scapes.  <p>Moonchild.  Cool intro quickly introducing the theme, which wastes no time in starting a fist-pumping synth/power chord section, and \r\nthen away we go with a killer metal tune.  Great solo toward the end, and I always smile at Dickinson's meniacal laugh.<p>Infinite Dreams.  No doubt this one is progressive as well.  A restrained intro is a bit deceiving: this song has plenty of rock, with a \r\nton of melodies and tempos packed into six minutes.  Great stuff!<p>Can I Play with Madness, The Evil that Men Do.  You know, a little bit of eighties excess isn't all bad.  Although somewhat formulaic \r\nand cliche, these are very enjoyable songs that serve to lighten up the album a little (not considering lyrical content though).<p>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  The rest of the album may have taken a while for me to fully appreciate, but this one grabbed me \r\nright away.  A simple yet catchy metal crunch and probably a bit too enthusiastic vocals set up a truly inspired final six minutes.  \r\nCreepy basslines, vocal synths and spoken word build perfectly to an expertly choreographed jam to close the track.  About as good \r\nas prog metal gets for me!<p>The Prophecy, The Clairvoyant, Only the Good Die Young.  Three rockers that each have unique progressive elements that make \r\nmeaningful and diverse contributions to the album, whether it's a surprisingly tasteful acoustic fadeout (The Prophecy), a killer \r\nopening bassline (The Clairvoyant), or the reprise from the opener to finish the album (Only the Good Die Young).<p>In short, these guys have created a masterpiece because they have successfully incorporated enough diversity in sounds and \r\nstyles, while still offering plenty of what they do best, which is in-your-face rock.  Cohesive, fun, and energetic.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=137670#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=137670\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=137670\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 10, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #137670)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI am a bit disillusioned with this offering compared to \"Powerslave\" and \"Somewhere In Time\".<p>It is a collection of metal songs : some uninspired and some fabulous ones . <p>\"Moonchild\" (the opener) start as \"Radar Love\" (from the great \"Golden Earring\") but the intro is the best it has to offer. \"Infinite \r\nDreams\" is an average rock ballad (pleasantly dynamited in its second half) , or the AOR-ish \"Can I Play With Madness\" which opens \r\nas \"Carry On...\" from \"Kansas\". Even if it lasts for only three seconds, this intro automatically reminds me of that great \"Kansas\" \r\nsong (as Gatot also mentions in his review).\r\nSome heavy-pop metal with \"The Evil That Men Do\".<p>Several songs will be introduced by some prog related short instrumental parts. But this isn't enough to call this one a prog-related \r\nalbum.<p>Still, there will be three excellent songs available here. But they are bizarrely located at the end of the album.<p>The long title track of course. A recent tendency from the band since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" featured on the \r\nalbum \"Powerslave\" and \"Alexander The Great\" (from \"Somewhere In Time\"). It features a nice \"prog-related\" break but it is more a \r\nprog-metal anthem. \"Riverside\" and \"Dream Theater\" (and many others) must have listened to this piece of the Maiden repertoire \r\n(but not only to this one of course).<p>\"The Clairvoyant\" and \"Only the Good Die Young\" which are a bit similar in structure. Fast beat, nice and melodic guitar and a catchy \r\nchorus. Simple in structure but far much better than most of the tracks.<p>Three stars for this good album. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=153639#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=153639\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=153639\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, December 2, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #153639)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is where IRON MAIDEN goes all proggy on us,making a concept album and using synths. Oh my ! The \r\nconcept is apparently about a young man who prophesies the destruction of his village, only to be ridiculed \r\nto the point where he goes insane(been there) and eventually commits suicide. I really do believe these \r\nguys were at the top of their game at this point in their careers. Confident, feeling they could do no \r\nwrong. Thankfully they had the guts to go out on a limb and do some progressive things. And it's great to \r\nhear a concept album that actually is full of fantastic songs.<p>\r\n\"Moonchild\" opens with some spoken words and acoustic guitar before we get some power. Crank it up ! It's \r\nfull speed ahead 1 1/2 minutes in as the human siren begins to sing. The best bass player i've ever heard \r\nlays down some extraordinary lines. A sinister laugh signals the end of this one. \"Infinite Dreams\" is one of \r\nmy favs. It opens with a tasteful guitar melody as reserved vocals follow. The song starts to build. I love the \r\nsound after 3 minutes as it kicks into a higher gear. Check out the guitar solo before 5 minutes !  \"Can I \r\nPlay With Madness\" is a fun,uptempo track with a sing-a-long chorus. This would have fit well \r\non \"Somewhere In Time\". Some incredible instrumental work when Bruce stops singing before 3 minutes. A \r\nvery uplifting song. \"The Evil That Men Do\" leaves us with IRON MAIDEN's calling card 30 seconds in. That \r\nwould be their famous galloping rhythm. <p>\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\" might be my favourite \r\ntrack. Such a heavy rhythm to it. The vocal melodies are fantastic that come and go. Head banging time. The \r\nquiet interlude after 4 1/2 minutes is outstanding. This is one of the best passages on the album. It ends \r\nabruptly when a violent guitar solo comes in from nowhere. A shred fest follows. \"The Prophesy\" opens \r\nwith tasteful guitar and the vocal style reminds me of \"Piece Of Mind\". The lead guitar breaks away from \r\nthe pack 2 1/2 minutes in with some scorching solos. \"The Clairvoyant\" is another killer track. Check out \r\nthe bass intro ! This is classic MAIDEN right here. The tempo picks up on the chorus. I get goosebumps when \r\nBruce sings about 4:15 in. \"Only The Good Die Young\" is a Billy Joel cover. NOT !! This is an uptempo closer \r\nthat gives me chills. Ripping guitar as the rhythm gallops along. Great chorus.This would have been a good \r\nconcert closer. The spoken words from the intro are reprised to end it.<p>\r\nThis isn't even in my top 3 favourite IRON MAIDEN albums, but it's essential in my opinion.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=158613#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=158613\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=158613\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, January 14, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #158613)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1442\"><strong>russellk</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1442\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1442/Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis album is such an improvement on the metal-lite of the MAIDEN's early career. The songs have\r\nvariety and even subtlety (gasp!), providing this listener with a much more satisfying experience.<p>It's all here. A concept, widespread progginess in complex rhythms, time changes, solos that\r\nactually matter, keyboards and vocal harmonies. The boys have worked hard, and it shows. The first\r\nthree songs are all worthwhile exercises, particularly 'Infinite Dreams', though 'The Evil that Men\r\nDo' is rather pointless. The title track redeems the album, though, and encourages me to seek out\r\nthe album previous to this one. Even DICKINSON's laboured delivery can't ruin a splendid track,\r\nreminiscent of RAINBOW's mighty 'Stargazer', especially in one of DICKINSON's descending vocal\r\nfigures. Like his soundalike RONNIE JAMES DIO he just keeps singing: there's barely a moment in the\r\nfirst four minutes of the song where he takes a breath. The album concludes with three reasonable\r\ntracks.<p>Still not a band I'd care to listen to regularly, but this album sits comfortably in my collection.\r\nAnd the title track is really a good piece of prog-metal.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=167831#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=167831\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=167831\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, April 17, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #167831)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>\"Infinity is hard to comprehend\"</strong><p>I am not a fan of Iron Maiden in general, but Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son is a simply brilliant album! This is by far Iron Maiden's best and most progressive album. Indeed, it is probably one of the very best Metal albums of the 80's. One reason for this is that while all previous Iron Maiden albums were very much of their time, Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son sounds <em>timeless</em>. The album is loosely based on a concept that really enhances the music without taking control of it. The lyrics are captivating and intriguing and never cheesy (as is too often the case in this type of music). Both the band themselves and the majority of their fans would probably deny it, but this is <em>art!</em> It is evident that the band here take their inspiration equally from Yes, Genesis, Queen and Jethro Tull as they do from Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Judas Priest. Whatever Punk influence there was present on earlier albums is wholly absent here.<p>The riffs, solos and vocal melodies are instantly and <em>infinitely</em> appealing to me and perfectly executed throughout. The drums are loaded and rather complex. Many interesting time and mood changes occur throughout the whole album. The excellent guitars are often augmented by symphonic keyboards that give the music a fuller, more symphonic sound than on earlier (and later) Iron Maiden albums. The previous album Somewhere In Time also had more keyboards than most other Iron Maiden albums, but on Somewhere In Time the keyboards sounded thin and had a much more typical 80's sound. <p>On a couple of songs acoustic guitar is used which gives the music a slight folky touch and brings more diversity to the whole. One thing that I really like about this album (and that helps to make the album a unified whole) is that is starts out with a short acoustic/vocal part that is repeated at the very end on the album.

Around the middle the song turns frantic and explosive with unexpected and \r\nextremely dramatic changes, again a fantastic track from start to end.<p>\"Can I Play With Madness\" starts with the chorus, something unusual for IRON MAIDEN \r\nwho normally start softer and go \"ion crescendo\" until the climax, and to be honest, I don't \r\nlike the change, despite the powerful moments I feel this song closer to mainstream metal \r\nblended with AOR which is not my cup of tea.<p>In \"The Evil that Men Do\", the band returns to their classical and mysterious sound, and \r\nthen the power can be felt with Nicko giving his best, in their most characteristic style they \r\nmanage to create complex structures and unexpected changes, keeping the listener at the \r\nedge of the seat.<p>\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" is everything that you can expect from a song that takes the \r\nname of the album, all the band is perfect, everything is in it's place the structure is one of \r\nthe most coherent I ever heard in Prog, even the vocals grow in intensity and go higher as \r\nthe track gets hotter.<p>After a guitar break a surprisingly soft passage with the synths adding an incredibly \r\nmysterious sound that matches perfectly with the narration that explains the main theme of \r\nthe song. again the music grows in intensity with the keyboards following McBrain who \r\nsounds as a human metronome and then the guitars announce a new climax.....If this is \r\nnot Progressive rock, I guess the genre doesn't exist.<p>\"The Prophecy\" begins making us believe we are before a power ballad, but don't let this \r\nfool you, the change happens in a fraction of second and the band again give everything \r\nthey have, this time with even more radical changes and a clear Symphonic background, \r\none of the highest moments of the album.<p>\"The Clairvoyant\" starts with Steve Harris doing a very nice bass solo but soon is joined by \r\nthe guitars and then the rest of the band. The more I listen this band, the more surprised I \r\nam with how respectful of structures and atmospheres IRON MAIDEN is, in comparison of \r\nmost Metal bands who base their style in the individual virtuosity of their musicians. As \r\nusual the band makes unexpected changes and wonderful instrumental breaks, not a \r\nweak moment...well maybe except \"Can I Play With Madness\" which is not bad but surely \r\nthe weakest link.<p>The album end with \"Only the Good Die Young\" in which we can listen one of the most \r\ntypical IRON MAIDEN tracks, in the vein of \"Aces High\", \"Run to the Hills\" or \"The Trooper\", \r\nbut this time with keys to make it more Prog, great closing section with the same vocal \r\npassage with which the album started.<p>Without doubts one of the best Metal albums I ever heard, if only all Prog Metal sounded \r\nlike IRON MAIDEN, I would be a fan of the sub-genre.<p>4 solid stars that should be 4.5 but sadly not 5 because of \"Can I Play With Madness\" which \r\nis bellow their level.<p>Highly recommended.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219688#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219688\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=219688\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 3, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #219688)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe English (progressive) heavy metal band Iron Maiden was the first thing I really loved as a person and I have listened to their music since around my eleventh birthday. I still listen to their first ten records or so with great joy. Of these records 'Seventh Son' from 1988 is considered to be one of the most interesting for listeners of progressive rock because of its conceptual approach, synth layers and progressive song-writing and production. The band had already explored using synth-guitars on the sci-fi themed 'Somewhere on Time', but here the band lost its heavy and frontal edge to much in process (in my opinion that is). On 'Seventh Son' the band presents some timeless melodic metal classic like 'The Evil That Man Do' and 'The Clairvoyant' and some more symphonic metal pieces like the doomy ballad 'Infinite Dreams' and the epic title-song - which serves as an Maidenesque elaboration on Rainbow's 'Stargazer'. The opening song 'Moonchild' serves as a good musical introduction to this rather dark album; for it establishes the re-newed Iron Maiden with its fantasy story-line songwriting quite well. The poppy metal song 'Can I Play With Madness' became a minor hit and though its clearly no highlight on the album, it does offer some conceptual song-writing ideas in an accessible format. In conclusion, one of the best prog-infused metal albums of the eighties and a highlight in Iron Maiden's long and fruitful career. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=237972#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=237972\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=237972\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 7, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #237972)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe last great Maiden album or the start of the commercial descent. Pick your choice.<p>After the ill-received attempt to open up their sound on <em>Somewhere In Time</em>, Maiden gave it\r\none more brave try before encountering their final collapse. Nevertheless, <em>7th Son</em> is the\r\nresult of a band applying a formula to recreate their earlier glories, rather then the sound of\r\nmusicians trying to challenge themselves. <p>The resulting creative slack can be heard on most songs. <em>Infinite Dreams</em> is a nasty piece of\r\ncommercial sing-along pop-metal, with bad transitions, uninspired playing and all hard-rock clich\u00e9s\r\nclutched together. But it gets worse, nothing tops <em>Can I Play With Madness</em> in ultimate\r\ncheesiness. In fact only 3 tracks come near to the height of their best material: the opening\r\n<em>Moonchild</em>, the <em>7th Son</em> epic and the album closer <em>Only The Good Die Young</em>. They\r\nall feature adequate Maiden style-exercises. Also <em>The Clairvoyant</em> has a number of good\r\nmoments, typically in the verses and the instrumental parts. Overall, the trivial choruses make this\r\nwhole album too ordinary and even indigestible for me.<p>For many this is a power-metal classic so please feel free to try your luck. For me this is where a\r\nsuperfluous progressive pretension can't hide the lack of interesting ideas, with mostly predictable\r\nand commercial music as a result. 2.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260769#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260769\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=260769\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 14, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #260769)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Seventh album and one of the most progressive for Iron Maiden.</strong><p>The progressive metal of Iron Maiden began with \"Powerslave\" and \"Seventh Son of a \r\nSeventh Son\" takes it to the next level with a full blown conceptual masterpiece, the best \r\nIron Maiden album along with \"Brave New World\". The songs are longer on this release \r\nwith multiple time sig changes, complex arrangements and intricate guitar breaks. There is \r\na great deal of synth passages here giving this a decidedly progressive feel. The lyrics are \r\nvery much locked into the theme of apocalyptic cataclysm, thematic content of Biblical \r\nproportions; the number seven being such a pivotal number in the Bible, yet Maiden were \r\nspouting 666 in their early years.  <p>Bruce Dickinson the 'Air raid siren' is at the peak of his powers here with some absolutely \r\nincredible vocal work such as 'Moonchild'. This begins with very gentle acoustic and soft \r\nvocals until the fiend is unleashed and a breakneck speed riff blitzes along. It is complex \r\nand the rhythm is interconnected by lead guitar, McBrain's pounding drums and a stunning \r\nbassline from Harris. The lyrics are interesting; \"Seven downward slopes, Seven bloodied \r\nhopes, Seven are your burning fires, Seven your desires\". The theme is ingrained from the \r\nstart.<p>'Infinite Dreams' is a slower song with dark lyrics, \"Suffocation waking in a sweat, Scared to \r\nfall asleep again, In case the dream begins again, Someone chasing I cannot move, \r\nStanding rigid a nightmare's statue, What a dream when will it end, And will it transcend.\"<p>'Can I Play With Madness' is one of the big songs that has featured in live performances \r\nover the years. The lyrics are as engaging as ever, \"Can I play with madness? The prophet \r\nstared at his crystal ball, Can I play with madness? There's no vision there at all, Can I play \r\nwith madness? The prophet looked at me and laughed at me, ha ha, He said: Can I play \r\nwith madness? He said you're blind, too blind to see.\" A very polished sound with pristine \r\nproduction provides an upbeat atmosphere, with harmonies and twin duelling guitars that \r\nare bang on note perfect. <p>'The Evil That Men Do' is another melody driven popular track that graces live sets with \r\ncatchy chorus that every Iron fan knows, \"Living on a razor's edge, Balancing on a ledge, \r\nLiving on a razor's edge you know, you know, the evil that men do lives on and on...\" The \r\nlead solo passage is virtuosic with fret melting prowess from the legendary Smith and \r\nMurray.<p>'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' is the tour de force of progressive classics that clocks in at \r\nvirtually 10 minutes. There are a myriad of twists and turns in the musical structure from \r\npeaceful chants to majestic flourishes back to blistering pulse racing tempo metal gallops. \r\nThe lyrics are powerful and epic, \"Today is born the seventh one, Born of woman the \r\nseventh son, And he in turn of a seventh son, He has the power to heal, He has the gift of \r\nthe second sight, He is the chosen one, So it shall be written, So it shall be done.\" The \r\ninstrumental break is genius featuring fractured guitar riffing and complicated drum \r\nmetrical patterns. <p>'The Prophecy' features a trade off between bass and lead that drive it and it is difficult to \r\npin down any particular melody as it is chaotic with an off kilter time sig and ethereal soft \r\npassages.  The theme of prophecies and good versus evil continues, \"I had their lives in \r\nmy hands, Their fates their fortunes in my visions, No one believed in my true prophecy, \r\nAnd now it's too late.\"<p>'The Clairvoyant' is one of the highlights, with a frenetic dynamic riff that begins it that every \r\nMaiden fan would instantly recognise. The emotional lyrics from Dickinson are about \r\nholding and never giving up no matter what happens, and this is sung at top volume with \r\nutter conviction; \"There's a time to live and a time to die, When it's time to meet the maker, \r\nThere's time to live but isn't it strange, That as soon as you're born you're dying.\" This \r\nbecame a Maiden anthem for good reason and once again is a live favourite.<p>'Only The Good Die Young' is another popular Maiden track with speed metal licks and \r\npowerhouse vocals. It ends the album on a high note and the guitars are as awesome as \r\never with twin tapping and arpeggios, high string bends and speed picking; Murray and \r\nHarris are a force to be reckoned with.  <p>The progressive style is a welcome change on this album leading to more prog metal to \r\ncome and it was the only direction for Iron Maiden after they showed their versatility on \r\nprevious albums, such as \"Powerslave\", with the ultra brilliant masterpiece 'Rime of the \r\nAncient Mariner', or at least glimpses of their talent such as 'Hallowed Be Thy Name'. On \r\nthe next few albums the versatility and virtuoso instrumentation is taken to the highest \r\ndegree. Enjoy the ride, as it does not get much better than this. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289821#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289821\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=289821\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, July 10, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #289821)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>This is suppose to be the creative peak of Iron Maiden's career and yet I lack everything that has to do with progress and imagination on the missed opportunity that is <em>Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son</em>.</strong><p>\r\nThe album follows the same generic album formula that the band have been using since <em>The Number Of The Beast</em>. Even if it did work on a few occasion, like <em>Powerslave</em> and <em>Somewhere In Time</em>, most of the time it just resulted in a mixed bag of albums that really couldn't be considered challenging by any means. This is pretty much the issue I have with this record, but I'll have to admit that the high regard that most people have for this release irritates me even more than usual.<p>\r\nMusically this album is not different from the previous releases where we had our singles, one or two epics and a few album tracks that ranged from average to pretty decent in quality. Yes, there is the minor addition of synthesizer sound on a few instances but it's used very sparsely and most people would probably not even notice it on most occasions. It's really not like the band have completely reinvented their sound here like for example Rush did between <em>Moving Pictures</em> and <em>Signals</em>. To be honest, this is pretty much your typical Iron Maiden '80s album in every regard of the definition.<p>\r\nThe individual songs are suppose to be interlinked by a conceptual arc but I honestly never saw it as such since there is no feeling of a mood or progression between the compositions. What you get is a typical array of tracks that I've mentioned previously. There are only two real exception to the rule. One being <em>Can I Play With Madness</em> which is in my opinion the worst single released by the band and I tend to skip it almost every time I listen to the record. The album's title track is suppose to be a 10 minute epic of the album but the tracks is just so bland and uninspired that there's just no comparison between it and excellent predecessors like <em>Hallowed Be Thy Name</em>, <em>To Tame A Land</em>, <em>Rime Of The Ancient Mariner</em> and <em>Alexander The Great</em>. The format is pretty much the same as on <em>Rime Of The Ancient Mariner</em> but without any real kick to it, making the overall performance feeling very underwhelming.<p>\r\nI would only recommend <em>Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son</em> to the existing fan base of the band and fans of their pseudo-intellectual prog related merits that are depicted on this record. Most newcomers will most likely get a lot more value out of experiencing <em>Powerslave</em> or <em>Somewhere In Time</em> before approaching this flawed record.<p>**** star songs: Infinite Dreams (6:09) The Evil That Men Do (4:34) The Prophecy (5:05) The Clairvoyant (4:27) Only The Good Die Young (4:42)<p>*** star songs: Moonchild (5:39) Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (9:53)<p>** star songs: Can I Play With Madness (3:31)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=551070#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=551070\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=551070\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 16, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #551070)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23131\"><strong>Isa</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23131\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23131/220px-JohnDunsScotus_-_full.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n|B| Another late 80s push toward prog-metal by one of metal's most famous acts: Iron \r\nMaiden.<p>It's pretty clear, hearing even the first minute or so of this album, that this album is more \r\nthan worthy of the style \"prog-related\", as an intro with acoustic guitar and keyboard \r\narpeggios with lyrics leading into a concept album aren't exactly, uh, sell-out strategies.  The \r\nNWBHM cliches are a bit less prominent in this album as well, though accusations of the \r\nband's tendency toward self-plagiarism are still not entirely unfounded in my opinion, or at \r\nleast the tracks I have heard from their previous releases. This is mostly a notable release \r\nfor the clear direction toward progressiveness that many metal bands (even this stable 80s metal \r\nband) were starting to commit to in the late eighties. This trend would inevitably lead to full-\r\nblown prog-metal it would become with the release of Images and Words.<p>The general use of keyboards and more diverse guitar work are probably the main factors in \r\nthe bands' general slight prog tendencies, and I've personally always thought of Rush \r\nhaving had a far amount of influence on this band's sound. As the album progresses, the \r\nprogressive sound of the band increases, often sounding like early Dream Theater and the \r\nother bands pushing toward prog-metal at the time, Queensryche, Savatage, and Fates \r\nWarning.<p>Moonchild, despite its interesting intro, is more your standard heavier track, whilst Infinite \r\nDreams (by far my favorite track on the album) is a great track with a lot of diversity and \r\ncontrast, and great synth pads. I'm not a big fan of the bass' sound on this album, it has too \r\nmuch pop and not enough meat. The duel guitar work and solo are nicely done. I love the \r\nlead into the chorus. Great fade-out with the keyboard. Can I play with Madness actually \r\nstarts with the chorus with the vocal harmonies a-Capella, definitely a less cliche \r\ncomposition strategy The break into the chorus is much too abrupt, but the chorus itself is \r\none of my favorite moments on the album, especially with the driving energy from keyboard \r\nand guitar. The Evil That Men Do has a really proggy intro, synth pads riding over a very \r\nconvincing riff. The verse and chorus are for more compliant with the British Steel style, the \r\ngalloping guitar work and what not, though the lyrics are really great. I like the solo section a \r\nlot, definitely sounds like Dream Theater sort of material, not surprising since Iron Maiden is \r\none of their obvious influences. The song ends on a great great note. Seventh Son of a \r\nSeventh Son is the \"epic\" album title track, starting off with choir \"ohs\" and \"ahs\" that match \r\nup with the guitar. Dickinson really shows off his singing with his \"ohs.\" It's pretty clear that \r\nthe Rainbow Rising album (also prog-related), particularly the track Stargazer, was a \r\nprimary influence in the sound of this track. I really love it when the track goes into the soft \r\nsection with he clean guitar/bass/cymbals playing quietly, Dickinson speaking over it with \r\nthe synth pads again. The section that this leads into, the guitar chugs that echo, sounds \r\nmuch like the beginning of Metropolis Pt. 1, for sure not a coincidence. This is basically a \r\nprog-metal track made in 1988, around when Queensryche, Fates Warning, and Savatage \r\nwere progging up their works as well. The Prophecy has an intro that continues this feel of \r\nprog-metal attitude, leading as these tracks often do to the more standard British Steel \r\nsound. However, the outro has classical guitar, which is quite nice sounding. The Clairvoyant has a cool bass intro, but is a slightly weaker track despite continuing the more \r\nprogressive sound. Its still a very good one with some interesting sections.<p>This is a solid 80s metal album which, along with the more prominent 80s prog-metal \r\nbands, showed great implications to where metal would be moving in the nineties with \r\nprog-metal. It is unfortunate that grunge had so smothered metal's popularity, for there may \r\nhave been more bands who thought they might economically make it as prog-metal bands, \r\ncontinuing where the 80s metal bands had been leaving off, Dream Theater being the only \r\nmain known band to carry the torch (in terms of pure prog-metal as it is defined on this site).  \r\nNot unlike Marillion during the eighties with prog rock I suppose.<p>This is an album recommended for metal listeners, and is essential to the (\"pure\") prog-\r\nmetal fan, as there's little in here that a fan of the genre would dislike. A lot of the genre's \r\nsound today has its origins in the more progressive sounding metal albums of this era.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=561085#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=561085\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=561085\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, November 1, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #561085)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe peak of Bruce Dickinson's first stint in the band when it comes to musicianship, \r\ncomplexity, and artistic achievement, this semi-concept album finds the band in excellent form, \r\nfully integrating synthesisers into their sound in a way which proved that the lessons of \r\nSomewhere In Time had been well-learned.

The album that IRON MAIDEN had been hinting at finally coming to fruition. Steve Harris'\r\nprogressive rock influences had been showing themselves from the very first album and creeping their\r\nway into each album with an ever stronger presence until on \"Powerslave\" the fully formed\r\nprogressive behemoth \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" reared its monstrous almost 14 minute head.\r\nSurprised was I that the next album \"Somewhere In Time\" was not the fully developed concept album\r\nhinted upon, but on SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON, the seventh deadly sinful studio album, all that\r\nprogginess unleashes itself and in a truly satisfying way that makes this my absolute favorite\r\nMAIDEN album of their entire career and since I pretty much like every stage of their career (with\r\nthe exception of the 90s) that is a major accomplishment in my book.<p>The story and album title comes from the 1987 novel \"Seventh Son\" by Orson Scott Card, upon which\r\nthe concept is loosely based. In ancient western myths the seventh son of a seventh son (or\r\ndaughters as well) supposedly possessed heightened occultic abilities such as clairvoyance,\r\nphophetic dreams and the like. The story unfolds starting with \"Moonchild\" where Lucifer tries to\r\nmanipulate the parents of the seventh son as to harness his powers for his own evil. The rest of the\r\nalbum continues through the trials and tribulations of the father of the seventh son and son himself\r\nlearning to control their powers and cope with the clairvoyant visions of their world slowly being\r\ndecimated by evil forces. All in all the lyrics are vague and have a definite air of mystery which\r\nmakes this an album that can be interpreted in many ways.<p>The real treat on this album is the music itself with extended song lengths, multi-segmented song\r\nstructures, atmospheric keyboards added, progressive time signatures and just the fact that IRON\r\nMAIDEN didn't deviate from their sound or formulaic songwriting approach. They simply did what they\r\nwere already so adept at laying out and simply let the music process progressively unfold when and\r\nwhere it made sense to do so. The result is a smashing success that still sounds like an IRON MAIDEN\r\nalbum but also doesn't at the same time. Unlike other metal bands who were also dabbling with\r\nkeyboards at the time, MAIDEN used them only to embellish the music and not create a whole new\r\ninstrumental section. One of my favorite albums of all time that sits well on the top of my huge\r\nheap of must-have releases. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1281714#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1281714\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1281714\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 22, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1281714)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is apparently the end of a string of seven classic albums from one of the 1980s progenitors of the prog metal \r\nscene.<p>P.S. I know that a 1998 remaster and 2015 remix exist but I've made the effort, as always, to go back to the original \r\nversion(s) when and where possible in order to be sure I'm reviewing the year-appropriate music (with its original \r\nproduction values).<p>1. \"Moonchild\" (5:39) the album intro sets the scene but also establishes the sound and performance commitment to \r\nthe material. Some very RUSH like sounds to the opening, but things kick into gear in the second minute, a pretty cool \r\ngradual transition into full speed. Bruce Dickinson makes quite the theatric effort for the get go. It's pretty good (even \r\nif I dislike that 4/4 rock drum beat). (8.75/10)<p>2. \"Infinite Dreams\" (6:09) a HENDRIX-like blues-rock musical base over which Bruce does more of his iconic magic. \r\nHe's so convincing! Musically, it's rather derivative (and boring) though the performances are all great--especially those \r\nof the bass and guitarists. (8.75/10)<p>3. \"Can I Play With Madness\" (3:31) machine gun guitar riffing over an AC/DC musical foundation shifts to boring \r\nstandard chorus delivery. Bruce feels like he's phoning it with a Roger Daltry performance in on this one. (8.5/10)<p>4. \"The Evil That Men Do\" (4:34) straightforward Thin Lizzy style intro turns into a fast-paced rocker over which Bruce \r\ngives a top notch performance with plenty of impressive high notes and great dramatic  Richard Burton-like \r\nallocutions in between. A top three song for me. (9/10)<p>5. \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" (9:53) opening with a fairly original intro weave, by the second half of the first \r\nminute the band falls into line within a repeating Led Zeppelin-like chugging bass-and-guitar riff while Bruce sings. At \r\nfirst Bruce's performance is a bit lackluster, but then the chorus comes with Bruce's repetition of the song title is quite \r\nimpressive. Unfortunately, there is very little else remarkable about this over the course of the first half of this song \r\nother than Bruce's impressive wordless vocalise after each verse and chorus. At 3:55 occurs the first shift, and, after it, \r\nsome of the album's more proggy music: Mellotron-like banked vocal chord play within quiet, delicate instrumental \r\ncontributions from the rest of the band members. This cinematic space is then dispelled at 6:55 and then  smashed to \r\nsmithereens by a supercharged (and impressive) metal instrumental passage until the song's end. Quite impressive! \r\n(18.25/20)<p>6. \"The Prophecy\" (5:05) delicate electric guitar arpeggi with synth wash chords below in support are soon joined by \r\ntwo more electric guitars (more in the metal sound palette). But this is just the 45-second intro. A pause precedes the \r\nlaunch into the full-band power metal music over which Bruce Dickinson provides another great vocal performance \r\n(sounding, at times, quite a bit like 1970s vocalist . Very impressive skills put on display from the band in the lightning-\r\nfast instrumental passage and the delicate acoustic finish. (9/10)<p>7. \"The Clairvoyant\" (4:27) for this song the bass gets a brief solo intro (impressive!) before the rest of the band joins in \r\nto establish the fabric for the rest of the song. The bass continues to impress as the melodic guitar play over the top \r\nsupports Bruce's subdued vocal. At 2:02 there is a shift into a \"there's a time to live, and a time to die\" section before \r\nreturning to the original two-step for a brief guitar solo. The \"time to live, ?\" sections feel quite incongruous with the \r\nrest of the flow of the song: the motif being force-spliced in against the nature of the song. (8.667/10)<p>8. \"Only The Good Die Young\" (4:42) opens with a sound that seems to conjoin some Blue \u00d6yster Cult and AC/DC \r\nsounds and ideas. The chorus is kind of let down, as if Bruce and the band only thought to put it in there as an \r\nafterthought, but it is followed by a nice instrumental passage. The lyrics may make this song a fan favorite, but the \r\nmusic is, to my ears, nothing to write home about. A bit of a let down; a disappointing way to end the album. \r\n(8.667/10)<p>Total Time: 43:57<p>I like the production of this album better than that of the Queensr\u00ffche albums I've just listened to. Plus, Bruce \r\nDickinson's vocal performances just feel more authentic, less play-acted than those of the uber-talented Geoff Tate. <p>Apparently this album gets (some of) its inspiration from Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son /Alvin Maker series--a \r\nfantasy series that I love and devoured back in the day. It's a connection that I fail to hear or feel.<p>B+/a high four stars and an excellent addition to any prog metal loving music collector's album collection. A metal \r\nband that actually convinces me that this should fall under the umbrella of \"progressive rock music.\"</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2877656#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2877656\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2877656\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, January 23, 2023</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2877656)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=69885\"><strong>Hector Enrique</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=69885\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/69885/tool_ojo.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe use of synthesised guitars and bass on \"Somewhere in Time\" generated controversy regarding the sonic limits \r\nthat heavy metal sympathisers were willing to accept, but once again Iron Maiden decided that experimentation \r\nwas a necessary fuel for their creative process, and with the release of \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" (1988), their \r\nseventh album, they took their proposal along those paths, developing a conceptual work that incorporated new \r\nsonic layers from the keyboards. <p>\r\nFrom the surrealist cover where a disintegrated Eddie from the waist down holds an encapsulated baby (or \r\nsomething like that.... ) in an aseptic and icy setting, \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" thematically recreates the \r\neternal dispute between Good and Evil with the seer and chosen 'Alvin Maker' as the protagonist, starting from his \r\nbirth and the course of his life, fighting against evil powers and his own inner demons in a story inspired by the \r\nfantasy novel \"Seventh Son\" (1987) by the American playwright Orson Scott Card. <p>\r\nAnd even though the tone and power of the guitars drop a few decibels in \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\", the band \r\ndoes not renounce to them in songs of great effect like \"Can I Play with Madness\" and its catchy chorus, the \r\nenergetic \"The Evil That Men Do\", or the galloping \"The Clairvoyant\", intertwining them with songs of greater \r\nstructural complexity like \"Moonchild\" and its initial acoustic guitars and meandering keyboards decorating the \r\nflowing instrumental base, \"Infinity Dreams\" with Bruce Dickinson's powerful vocal register and stupendous middle \r\nsection, and what is surely one of Iron Maiden's greatest intersections with progressive rock, \"Seventh Son of a \r\nSeventh Son\", a mixture of guitar riffs and solos from the Dave Murray/Adrian Smith tandem, middle sections and \r\nshifting time signatures from Steve Harris' incredible bass and Nicko McBrian's percussion, and atmospheric \r\nsynthesizers. Finally, \"Only the Good Die Young' rounds off the conceptual character of the album with the same \r\nacoustic sonorities of its beginning. <p>\r\n\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" was the pinnacle of the Englishmen's experimentation, and moved the band's \r\ncentral axis a few degrees, not to get out of their seminal genre, but to extend its limits. <p>\r\nExcellent.<p>\r\n4/4.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3124716#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3124716\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3124716\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 12, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12930#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3124716)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son', the seventh studio album by metal legends Iron Maiden, has been on my playlist for well \r\nover a year by now.
