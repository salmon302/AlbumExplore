The name Vortex represents their approach to music - creating a spiral of musical ideas that surround one steady and calm component, which is the eye of the vortex. <br><br>The compositions for what became their first album were done while working on an avant-garde theatrical play called M'dame S91. The band was asked to provide the music for this play and it turned out that the play was done according to the music, instead. This play was to be in Avignon festival organized by students. This festival held from 17/7-11/8 1975 brought together Vortex with two other bands. Masal and Astarte. Masal was then the prominent \"Lyonnais groupe\". Astarte featured Martin Le-Bars, which was briefly in Magma and founded Eider Stellaire. Those encounters were important for their influence on the band and for later events in the band's duration. This piece of music which Vortex made for the festival was recorded and mastering of the poor quality recording was done by JBP studio in Lyon and this first album of Vortex sold several hundred copies and became a highly sought collector's item. <br><br>After the festival Vortex did only a few shows and began concentrating on rehearsing in various locations until settling down in early 1977 in a percussion school which doubled as their studio consisting of 3 soundproof rooms and an office. This school was managed by the future Vortex percussionist, Maurice Sonjon. It is in this period that another crucial sound crept up in the music created by Vortex. The Vivante brothers delved into the 20th century classical music by composers such as Bartok, Stravinsky and Messiaen. They would start implementing more of this style into their music, borrowing the methods used in the compositions they liked. As Aymeric Leroy states in his biography of the group in the cd booklet, one piece in particular was very influential. It was Messiaen's \"Et Exspecto Resurrectionem Mortuorum\" (1964), for wind, brass and percussion, that provided the starting point of \"Cycles de Thanatos\" which was the epos of their second release. The brothers borrowed 15 seconds of Messiaen's work to use as template for the \"Les Cycles.\". Leroy also mentions that Cycles \"was first intended for a war sequence in Alexandro Jodorowsky's cinematic transposition of Frank Herbert's \"Dune\", a project which sadly never came to fruition\". <br><br>For Vortex to achieve the sound that was demanded by the new style of compositions, new musicians were required. This is one point where Mazal influenced Vortex, because they had two saxophonists and this lead the brothers to recruit another one of their own in Jacques Guyot. They also recruited two classically-trained percussionists from the Lyons conservatory, Maurice Sonjon and Alain Chaleard. But people not only joined the band but also left it. Francois Gerald the drummer left and was replaced by Jean-Michel Belaich later on in 1977. Another recruited was classically-trained woodwind and keyboard player Christian Boissel. <br><br>In this period the brothers focused mainly on composing and training the other band members. They split the work between them: Jean-Pierre took charge of the percussion players and Jacques worked with the wind section. All this work culminated in \"Les Cycles de Thanatos\" which was ready by the spring of 1977 but only released in May 1979. The recording was slow and exhausting. It was done in Lyons studio in which it was done in two parts. The first half of the album was recoded in six weeks. This long time was due to the way they recorded - first was recorded the rhythm track and then came the other instruments, one after the other. The pieces were too complex to record it all at once and even perform it live. <br><br>It took them 9 months (devoted to rehearsing) before they returned to perform on stage in April 28, 1978 at the INSA concert. The months that followed were devoted to both live shows and the continuation of the work on the album. They spent a five-week period at Togo-Saga studios in August and September 1978 to finish the recording. In the meantime they kept on making raved and successful shows throughout France. <br>When the album was finally ready to be released in 1979, no label wanted anything to do with this progressive music that was too long, too sophisticated and non-commercial. They resorted to the only possible solution - creating their own label and releasing the album through it. They called their label - Faites Le Vous Meme (Do It Yourself), and distribution was done by Le Chant du Monde. The album finally sold ~3000 copies. <br>To support their album, they went on to perform several shows throughout France and one noticeable show was with Art-Zoyd in which they even performed Les Cycles together. <br><br>This period marks another turn in the band's chronicles. Personal and musical differences reached a peak resulting in Christian Boissel and Alain Chaleard leaving (to play together in another band). Maurice Sonjon opted for returning to his primary occupation - the percussion school. Jean-Michel Belaich also wanted to leave but waited until a replacement could be found. <br>After this Vortex participated in the Musiques Nouvelles (new music) festival. For this festival Vortex assembled a temporary lineup: Keyboard player Michel Tardieu, formerly of Terpandre; Gerard Jolivet and Guyot returned on saxes and Belaich on drums. Two additional musicians were called in as well: cellist Jacques Dessert; and percussionist and sax player Philippe Matias. <br>This festival had a most impressive lineup: Art Zoyd, Univers Zero, Yochk'o Seffer's Neffesh Music, Xalph and Uppsala. <br><br>A stable lineup reassembled around the Vivante brothers with Jolivet, Guyot and Tardieu along with a new drummer, Vincent Daune, who briefly was amember of Terpandre, and percussionist Bruno Heitz. Due to this lineup more rock oriented approach, a guitarist was added to the band - Bernard Monerri. <br>Tardieu composed an epic called Chronosophie which was as Leroy says:\" Heavily influenced by Bartok yet highly accessible and full of rock energy, this piece was to become the highlight of Vortex's concerts, along with a substantially re-arranged rendition of \"Les Cycles de Thanatos\". \" <br><br>This new lineup was also the one that performed the most live shows and they were basically always on the move. The band also shifted towards an improvisational approach rather than the meticulously and well-planned compositions the Vivante brothers created. Leroy says this on their shows back then: \"Vortex shows usual[y ended with extended encores consisting of such spontaneous performances, the duration of which occasionally extended to a couple of hours! \" <br>The time was appropriate to record another album, especially since the brothers Vivante became partners in the Dionysos label. But unfortunate as it is, this was not to be the case. Controversies rose again, and Vortex finally disbanded. This was because the band did not make enough money for its members to make a living on and they wanted to make more accessible music, with vocals, notions the Vivante brothers opposed to strongly. <br><br>Vortex two final concerts were in June 1980, one in France and the other in Germany (the only time they appeared outside of France). <br><br>Vortex is highly recommended to people who like fusion, 20th century classical music (by composers such as those mentioned above), chamber rock and even Canterbury (for their first album). <br>A true gem of progressive music. <br><br>Source for the

Flair</strong><p>Every once in a while I like to venture outside my habitual comfort zone when it comes to sourcing\r\nnew music. The older I've become, the harder these off-piste forays become, and yes, that does make\r\nme vulnerable to mistaking the resultant cold sores as vindication for falling into the arms of the\r\nworld's worst ski instructor: the Venus de Milo (thanks Tom). However, I plucked up every vestige of\r\nderring do remaining in my overripe soul for this release. That Bartok and Stravinsky  are\r\nname-dropped piqued my curiosity of course, and any band that are reckoned to have intuited the\r\nsublime chamber rock of Univers Zero and Art Zoyd are deserving of some of anyone's time innit?.<p>Given that this music was recorded in 1977 when (un)conventional wisdom was asking itself if anyone\r\nover the age of 25, with a centre parting and in gainful employment could be deemed a bona fide punk\r\nprovacateur, the prescience of this like minded amalgam of French artists is humbling to behold. All\r\nmanner of subsequent musical developments can be discerned on <em>Les Cycles De Thanatos</em> waaay\r\nbefore their time: chamber rock, math rock, what might pass for pre-post rock and the earnest\r\norientation of shoegaze (at a pinch) There is even a deferential nod to 20th Century post-modern\r\nluvvies like Steve Reich and Terry Reilly. Yep, commercial hara-kiri is being acted out here and the victims never\r\nlooked or sounded healthier.\r\nYou will also hear faint remnants of Gong, Zappa and a considerably less volatile Mahavishnu from time\r\nto time. (see <em>God is Good For You John</em> for some unexpectedly mordant Gallic humour)<p>Very little of what might be recognised as even tenuously <em>Prog</em>, is remotely equipped to\r\nwithstand the scrutiny afforded to 'academic' or 'art' music. I'm quite happy to admit that if the\r\n17 year old <em>me</em> had heard this record when it was released I would, in all likelihood , have\r\ndismissed it crassly as 'old hippies art wank blather'. Whether we care to accede to the idea or\r\notherwise, our beloved, eccentric and wilfully esoteric Prog mongrel is never gonna earn that\r\n<em>Best In Show</em> prize rosette from those judges we pretend don't matter. We can but console\r\nourselves in the knowledge that our rebellious pup can at least be trained to defecate in that\r\nstuck up bastard's conservatory next door. The music presented by Vortex on this album is about as close as <em>rawk</em> was ever going to get to donning the swishing vestments of\r\northodoxy in my lifetime. It should be self evident that the estimated sales of circa 3000 units\r\nwould have been insufficient to provide <em>any</em> working ensemble with the viability for a\r\nprofessional career. People don't take popular music seriously because people who like or understand it don't take\r\npopular music seriously.(loop to fade)\r\nWhat survives as 'Serious' Music now requires to be heavily subsidised while 'obscure' Popular music will always be\r\ndisqualified for subsidy as it ain't popular enough to be self sustaining. (DS al Coda)\r\nI know, the irony of toff's music being immunised from the germ warfare currently endemic in the free marketplace is hideous.<p>Thanatos was the Greek God of Death and with relatives holding offices as the \r\nequivalent deities for suffering, old age, deception, doom, blame, strife and retribution he was\r\nclearly not the sort of guy you would hang with on a Friday night to drink beer and stare at girls.\r\nWe're advised the seeds of the ambitious title track were sown from a 15 second fragment of a Messiaen\r\npiece. I don't know Messiaen at all but I do know Bartok and Stavinsky and even shorn of the eastern\r\neuropean peasant melodies and neo classical conceits, I can still recognise their palpable influence\r\nin the pacing, textures, percussion and developmental ideas deployed in this work. Such is the\r\nforensic rigour of the undertaking that this new found formal discipline would\r\ndesignate hooks, riffs or killer choruses followed by 'heroic' solos as hopelessly kitsch and plain\r\nvanilla tacky. You will require patience and perseverance to elicit the many delights that this\r\ncomposition can deliver so stick with it and just try to train your expectations away from those you\r\nare routinely inured to.<p>Listeners new to this band should maybe dip their blushing tootsies in the more welcoming waters of\r\n<em>God Is Good For You, John</em> and <em>Prolegomenes</em> first before negotiating the uncharted\r\nterritory of the title track. No-one should dive headlong into terra incognita (Ouch)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=768839#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=768839\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=768839\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 10, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=13735#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #768839)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13736\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2745/cover_26551912122006.jpg\" alt=\" 1975-1979 by VORTEX album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nBoxset/Compilation, 2003<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.67 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.67</span> | 24 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13736#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13736\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">1975-1979</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2745\">Vortex</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">RIO/Avant-Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=14323\"><strong>tmay102436</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=14323\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/14323/Lost_At_Sea.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWhat a hidden gem this group Vortex is! I had not heard of them, but gave them a try through our\r\ngood friend Syn-Phonic Music. <p>Surprise, surprise, surprise...an RIO giant.<p>The playing is superb, the usage of the instrumentation's voicing is stripped down, yet huge. But\r\nwhat makes this so irresistible is the composition. Such a wonderful blending of RIO with a lighter\r\njazz feel, that you never stop listening with open ears. Instead once the music starts, your sucked\r\ninto their world.<p>Both CD's are wonderful, but I enjoy the second more, as I really like the darker, more ominous\r\nsetting it pictures in your mind. This would have been wonderful in a live setting, as it has enough\r\nenergy to be that perfect RIO: the rock element driving the underside of the giant ship that prowls\r\nin the Avante Guard sea of bliss. <p>I must also mention that the recording is superb, which is a blessing, since this era of our beloved\r\nprogressive music was beginning to be frowned on, and production quality downgraded to less than pro\r\nquality. But not here, as the recording quality is clean and thick with power of the big label artist.<p>Thank goodness this Progarchives exist, and there are retail dealers that support our addiction. If\r\nyou like Univers Zero (the gods of this stuff) mixed with a slight jazzier, dare I say Canterbury\r\ninfluence, go get this CD, it'll be a nice gift to yourself!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=280053#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=280053\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=280053\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, May 1, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=13736#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #280053)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13735\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2745/cover_35811542018_r.jpg\" alt=\" Les Cycles De Thanatos by VORTEX album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 1979<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.22 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.22</span> | 67 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13735#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13735\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Les Cycles De Thanatos</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2745\">Vortex</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">RIO/Avant-Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Prog Reviewer</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nVORTEX has expanded their lineup from a five piece band(on their debut) to an eight piece band for this one.There are also two \r\nguest musicians who each play on one track. I really enjoyed their first one, but this one has topped it as far as i'm concerned. I know I \r\ntend to gush when i really like an album, so let's just say this is the perfect record to review on this special day(December 25). The \r\nfirst two songs very much reminded me of one of my favourite bands ZAO, while the over 25 minute epic is like a cross between \r\nUNIVERS ZERO and ART ZOYD. Interesting that ART ZOYD actually played on stage with VORTEX to perform this very song. Certainly \r\nthe album cover has more to do with this self titled track then it does the first two songs.The fact there is a guest basson player on it \r\npretty much says it all doesn't it ? <p>\r\n\"God Is Good For You, John\"  is apparently a reference to John McLaughlin. Once it gets going the air is filled with some beautiful guest \r\nviolin melodies and intricate sounds. I love this track. It reminds me so much of ZAO. Piano and light drums help to create that jazz \r\nflavour. Bass comes to the fore 3 1/2 minutes in. This sounds so good. \"Prolegomenes\" opens with percussion and cymbals that build \r\nas piano, xylophone and horns come in. It kicks into gear 2 1/2 minutes in with drums and sax leading the way. Great sound. The bass \r\nbecomes more prominant. Check out the drumming that follows. A change 5 minutes in as it becomes more jazzy. Terrific uptempo \r\nmelody. Percussion before xylophone returns 7 minutes in.  A darker more dramatic sound a minute later with some prominant \r\ndrumming to follow. The uptempo melody of earlier is back to close out the song. <p>\"Les Cycles De Thanatos\" begins slowly and darkly \r\nwith what sounds like solemn sax and basson. This slow moving UNIVERS ZERO(\"Heresie\") flavour continues for over 4 minutes. Then it \r\ncomes alive, and the sound is filled with suspense and tension as we continue in \"Heresie\" territory. This is chamber music at it's \r\nfinest. Incredible intricate sounds come and go including percussion and sax. Amazing stuff. The tempo picks up 16 1/2 minutes in and \r\nit's not as dark either. Again we get lots of intricate sounds that are fabulous. An actual catchy rhythm before 21 minutes that turns \r\ninto an uptempo mind boggling section 2 minutes later. This song has to be heard to be believed. And heard many times to be \r\ncomprehended. The two bonus tracks begin with \"Hipopotalamus Negrus\" that quickly shows off the band interplay as we hear a \r\ncollage of intricate sounds. The last 2 minutes turn into a calm, cool jazzy vibe with smooth sax melodies along with bass, light drums \r\nand piano. \"Ivanhoe\" again features so many different sounds coming and going after the 1 1/2 minute dramatic intro.The sound \r\nbecomes light and smooth as sax becomes more prominant later on.<p>\r\nThis is jaw-dropping music folks. And if your a fan of ZAO or UNIVERS ZERO you owe it to yourself to track this recording down.

As Sean Trane mentions this came out \r\nbefore both ART ZOYD and UNIVERS ZERO's debut albums. That alone makes this a special record. Three of the Five guys in this band were \r\nin a band previous to this that played a lot of SOFT MACHINE songs, and you can hear the jazz influence throughout this \r\nrecord. There is no lead guitar, but it is very much flute and sax led with piano, bass and drums filling out the sound.<p>\r\n\"Haroun' Thasckouack\" has some nice drumming in the intro before it calms down a minute in. Piano, light drums and flute 2 minutes in \r\nas the sound is building. Sax joins in and we have a great sound 5 minutes in, especially the drumming. The flute then returns with sax \r\nto a full sound. Check out the bass before 7 minutes with flute and drums. A calm after 9 minutes is brief. What a ride that \r\nwas ! \"Ahsquoumboum ' is darker with sax,drums and piano to begin with. Flute joins in. Sax and heavy drums 4 1/2 minutes \r\nin. \"Delicieuse Creature\" is the longest track at almost 15 minutes, it opens with a sax/drum melody before a calm with flute takes \r\nover. This contrast continues. The flute and sax melodies are so impressive. <p>\"Abominable Creature\" is a short track with some \r\ndissonant moments. Very much a group effort on this one. There are two bonus tracks beginning with \"C'est Cool,Raoul\" a slow \r\nmoving affair that begins with the flute leading the way with some percussion. The sax starts to take over and the tempo picks up \r\nafter 5 minutes as the drums come in. The tempo shifts a lot from here on in. The last couple of minutes are the best part of the song \r\nas it becomes quite solemn with a SINKADUS flavour(flute). \"Prolige 1\" opens like a house on fire with sax and drums leading the \r\nway. It calms down quickly as piano becomes the focus until the flute arrives. The tempo picks back up as sax returns.<p>\r\nThis is an essential record to add to your Rio / Avant-prog collection. Sort of a landmark really when it comes to this style of music.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156151#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156151\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=156151\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, December 21, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=13734#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #156151)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13736\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2745/cover_26551912122006.jpg\" alt=\" 1975-1979 by VORTEX album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nBoxset/Compilation, 2003<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.67 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.67</span> | 24 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13736#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13736\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">1975-1979</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2745\">Vortex</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">RIO/Avant-Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Special Collaborator</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAn excellent compilation that reissues two difficult-to-acquiure albums and gives on each disc some superb bonus tracks that add \r\nmuch value to the the respective albums.

In the \r\nmeantime, the group had undergone a few line-up changes, losing some mostly growing from a quintet into an octet, something not \r\nexactly wise for a group whose music was not exactly drawing huge crowds. <p>The opening track God Is Good To You is more of late 70's JR/F tune in the JL Ponty style than anything they had gotten us used to \r\nin their debut album. The following Prolegom\u00e8nes (of which we have a previous version in the bonus tracks of the debut album) \r\nstarts out on a Ratlege/Jenkins mode, staying jazz for a while, but as the track extends it goes more progressive, flirts with RIO, \r\nborders with Chamber Rock, reaching the sublime between the tenth and the twelfth minutes and subtly veering Zeuhl in the lasrt \r\ntwo minutes. Awesome stuff and just a preview of what's to come on the flipside. <p>The Cd reissue gives us the full 25 minutes of the sidelong title track, something that had not been feasible on the vinyl of those \r\nyears. Indeed the epic Tanathos starts out heavily depressive and AZoyd and UZero are not far away in terms of gloomy ambiance. \r\nYes, obviously there are also many moments when HCow or Hatfield &TN are hinted at, principaly<p>Again with the Cd reissue this second album comes with two bonus tracks, and just as it was the case with the debut album, they \r\nadd much value to the original album, so much that you'd swear they'd always been part of it. Hypopotalamus Negro is subtle and \r\nsuperb deconstruction of a Zoydian Zeuhl music into a simpler but just as superb jazz-rock. Ivanoe (Invanhoe for the English) is more \r\nof a full-blown Mahavishnu Orchestra-style jazz-rock-prog again growing a bit softer into a mid-70's Weather Report. <p>Just as incredible as its forerunner, Tanathos is a splendid album veering between chamber rock, Zeuhl, JR/F and RIO, and it might \r\njust be that it is the single best example of the four distinct styles merging together to form one single musical ensemble.  Clearly \r\nVortex has not usurped its name<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=150558#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=150558\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=150558\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, November 14, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=13735#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #150558)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13734\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2745/cover_192710542018_r.jpg\" alt=\" Vortex by VORTEX album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 1975<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.19 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.19</span> | 61 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13734#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13734\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Vortex</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2745\">Vortex</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">RIO/Avant-Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Special Collaborator</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nRecorded in the summer of 75, Vortex's self titled is one of the most accomplished Jazz-rock inflected prog rock from that era and \r\ncame from France's second city. Still nowadays regarded as the country's best kept secret, Vortex only recorded two albums \r\nthroughout their decade of music adventures that saw the group come from Testu Band to Urantia the Vortex. This debut album \r\nmust be seen nowadays as an absolutely essential piece of RIO, clearly preceding Art Zoyd and Univers Zero by a good 18 months \r\nheadstart. Indeed, the Vivante brothers' group was always scared of being compared to Magma's spectre <p>Starting on the rather startling (compared with the rest of the album's more sombre material) Haroun' Tasckouack opener the \r\npsychedelic jazz rock that seemed to ogle towards Out Of Focus, with its sax and flute works over Fender Rhodes and slowly \r\nevolving rhythms. The Ahsquoumboum is very different, borrowing a Kobaian rhythm, but keeping the sax Out Of Focus, but not \r\nout of tune. <p>The 14-mins+ D\u00e9licieuse Cr\u00e9ature track starts out again a bit in the OOF mode, but soon veers in a chamber rock but in a solid jazz-)\r\nrock vein with Vivante's great Fender Rhodes (being reminiscent of Ratledge or Jenkins >> Soft Machine and Nucleus respectively) \r\nunderlining the whole pedestrian march, somewhere between Magma and Zoyd, yet keeping an excellent psyched-out flute  and sax \r\nduo around. As an afterthought, the closing but all too short Abominable Cr\u00e9ature is a good outro, ending in a near chaotic free jazz.<p>The reissue of this album comes with two bonus tracks, which add much value to anotherwise rather short album. The superbly slow \r\neastern-sounding chimes'n-all track of Cool Raoul is an absolute joy and a slow evolving thing subtly evolving to another Nuclueus-\r\nSoft Machine and Out Of Focus wild track, before slowly reverting to its quieter entrance. These almost 12 minutes bonus could be \r\neven better than what the rest of the album had to offer. Prol\u00e9go 1 is a more Zeuhlian monster, even if the <p>An amazing album that can be likened to Out Of Focus, but heading out in a more Zeuhl-ish direction than the breass heavy German \r\ngroup's direction. Vortex's self-titled is definitely one of the most stunning album around from France in the 70's. <p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=149558#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=149558\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=149558\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, November 8, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=13734#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #149558)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13734\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2745/cover_192710542018_r.jpg\" alt=\" Vortex by VORTEX album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 1975<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.19 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.19</span> | 61 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13734#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13734\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Vortex</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2745\">Vortex</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">RIO/Avant-Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3283\"><strong>VanderGraafKommand\u00f6h</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Prog Reviewer</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=3283\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/3283/zeuhlkitty.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFrench instrumental avant-prog band <strong>Vortex</strong>'s debut album is a wonderful, jazz-fueled album, featuring lots of impressive flute, saxophone and Fender Rhodes piano throughout.<p>The opener <em>Haroun' Thasckouack</em> is a great start to an impressive album and if you like this track, you will like the rest of the album.  It is a chamber-rock orientated track, but stripped bare a little, it is not as dark and avant as they would later become.  The standout piece for me is <em>D\u00e9licieuse Cr\u00e9ature</em>, which always keeps my ears on their toes.  The intro to this track reminds me of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Our Favorite Things\", yet I am not sure if it is coincidental.  The Fender Rhodes playing of Jean-Pierre Vivant is most notable, yet the whole band keep everything together superbly and the bass playing is also sublime, subtlely being played in the background, yet actually being very prominent to the overall sound; for me, this is the sign of an excellent band with lots of ideas.  On <em>Ahsquoumboum</em> the bass playing becomes more prominent and the band play a slight jazzed-up Eastern sound.<p>As for avant-prog moments, well there are a few of them, but this is mainly impressively well composed jazz pieces with avant and prog leanings in small amounts.  They remind me a little of Jenkins/Ratledge era Soft Machine in places, yet without the Holdsworth/Etheridge guitar playing, which is intriguing, as the Vivant brothers were more likely influenced by <em>Third</em> era <strong>Soft Machine</strong> (they started their careers in a Soft Machine covers band).  They also have a distinct influence from 20th century composers, such as <strong>Olivier Messiaen</strong>, <strong>Igor Stravinsky</strong> and <strong>B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k</strong>, which underpins their more obvious jazz fixations.<p>Even though this is very little related to progressive rock, it is a wonderful album to listen to.  The band would get much more avant-prog orientated on their follow-up album \"Les Cycles de Thanatos\", dropping their jazz rock forays and incorporating a darker, more psychotic chamber rock sound.<p>My copy of \"Vortex\" features two bonus tracks, the first of which, <em>C'est Cool, Raoul</em>, is a tremendously slow and often haunting piece and much more akin to progressive rock than the previous tracks.  The Chinese cymbals at the beginning add a nice bit of atmosphere here, as does what sounds like a 'cello (not credited as such though).  Infact, it reminds me of Italian progressive rock at times, with the melancholic atmosphere.<p>The other bonus number is <em>Prol\u00e9go 1</em>, a faster, more bass orientated track, with lush and fluid flute and saxophone throughout.<p>This is an excellent introduction to a much forgotten band with a lot of power in their playing and incorporating a lot of thought in their compositions.  Their follow-up, as stated, continues on in a different vain, yet if they had never released it, this album would be classed as a masterpiece of chamber rock and jazz.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=132349#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=132349\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=132349\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, August 8, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=13734#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #132349)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13735\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2745/cover_35811542018_r.jpg\" alt=\" Les Cycles De Thanatos by VORTEX album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 1979<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.22 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.22</span> | 67 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13735#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=13735\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Les Cycles De Thanatos</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2745\">Vortex</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">RIO/Avant-Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5662\"><strong>Yukorin</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n[i]Distant cymbal crashes, controlled snare rolls brushed with the touch of a feather\r\nand an electric piano sounding unnervingly like Chick Corea and we're off into an\r\never descending journey to hell accompanied only by a dozen or so mute Frenchmen from\r\nLyons sporting tight fitting Pringle jumpers, facial hair configurations designed by\r\nDeep Blue, and a general disregard for personal hygiene. Oh an' The Electric Light\r\nOrchestra and the Dutch '74 World Cup squad's hairdresser and fashion adviser is\r\ntaggin' along for good measure. Pot-Pourri.<p>When I close my eyes and really listen to the sumptuous opener I see two things. The\r\nfirst is Valerie Leon and Claudia Cardinale having a catfight in 1968. The second is\r\na crack-squad of teenage North Korean female unicyclists wearing brown and orange\r\nstriped hot-pants waving ribbons in one hand and AK-47's in the other guarding a\r\nsacred river that has water so pure it is said to alleviate stresses from the back of\r\none's mind caused by a general lack of understanding of how an ant can expect to see\r\nan average life-span of approximately five years.<p>This gentle opener can not prepare anyone for what is about to follow. The greatest\r\npiece of music ever created by humans.<p>If there was ever a detective series set in France from 1979 starring Alain Delon and\r\nJean-Paul Belmondo as two men who wandered the rain drenched streets of autumnal\r\nSaint-Germain des Pres drinking Sancerre from hip-flasks and chain smoking Gauloises\r\nBrunes looking for whoever it was who stole Serge Gainsbourg's ashtray whilst driving\r\ntheir beat-up low-rider off-white Citroen SM in cream leather slip-ons then this is\r\nthe opening sequence theme. Sounds a bit like what would happen if the drummer from\r\nCurtis Mayfield's 'Superfly'  and the brass section of Out Of Focus with an unshaven\r\nJannick Top on bass and Stevie Wonder on keys and a select, invitation only swarm of\r\nmosquitoes loaded on Valium with Bernard Herrmann orchestrating had an impromptu jam\r\nsession on Concorde flying at low altitude over Big Ben. With brie.<p>Side two is one long, treacherous journey to escape Styx (unfortunately we also have\r\nto endure 'Paradise Theatre'). Originally commissioned for the aborted Alexandro\r\nJodorowsky filming of 'Dune' this is one hell of a dark epic. Would have fitted the\r\noriginal King Kong perfectly.The music picks up after fifteen minutes but still\r\nmanages to stay as depressing as finding a pubic hair embedded in your Big Mac and it\r\ncomes as no surprise to learn that Art Zoyd used to join Vortex on stage to perform\r\nthis at many of their shows.<p>Only 3000 copies were printed and mainly sold at their gigs. Track her down if you can.<p>Anyone familiar with The John Gregory Orchestra? Johnny did a lot of exotica and\r\ntelevision and soundtrack work in the 60s and 70s and used to go by the nom-de-plume\r\n'Chaquito'. In 1976 he released 'The Detectives' to a shocked world. His takes on\r\n'McCloud' and 'Policeman' and 'The Rockford Files' raised the bar to such a height it\r\nwas thought for the longest time that nothing could ever come as close to this for\r\norgasmic aural pleasure again. They were wrong.<p>Theme from Shoestring excepted.[/i]\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=103040#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=103040\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=103040\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 14, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=13735#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #103040)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:15px 0px;\">\r\n<font color=\"#a52a2a\">Thanks to <strong>avestin</strong> for the artist addition.\r\n\r\nand to <strong>Quinino</strong> for the last updates\r\n\r\n</font>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div><!-- End Main DIV -->\r\n\r\n\r\n</div> <!--END MAIN DIV-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:5px 0px;\">\r\nCopyright Prog Archives, All rights reserved. | <a href=\"Legalnotice.asp\"><font color=\"white\">Legal Notice</font></a> | <a href=\"PrivacyPolicy.asp\"><font color=\"white\">Privacy Policy</font></a> | <a href=\"/about_us.asp#advertise\"><font color=\"white\">Advertise</font></a><img src=\"../static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"> | <a href=\"/syndication.asp\"><font color=\"white\">RSS + syndications</font></a><img src=\"../static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:5px 0px;\">\r\n<strong>Other sites in the MAC network:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.JazzMusicArchives.com\"><font color=\"white\">JazzMusicArchives.com &mdash; jazz music reviews and archives</font></a> | <a href=\"http://www.MetalMusicArchives.com\"><font color=\"white\">MetalMusicArchives.com &mdash; metal music reviews and archives</font></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:20px 0px;\">\r\nDonate monthly and keep PA fast-loading and ad-free forever.\r\n<div style=\"margin:5px 0 0 0\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DRNRB8RG8NUN2\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:0px 0px;\">\r\n<!-- Server processing time: 0.83 seconds -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<script>(function(){function c(){var b=a.contentDocument||a.contentWindow.document;if(b){var d=b.createElement('script');d.innerHTML=\"window.__CF$cv$params={r:'9231546f5d2cff30',t:'MTc0MjQzMzAyNi4wMDAwMDA='};var a=document.createElement('script');a.nonce='';a.src='/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/scripts/jsd/main.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(a);\";b.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(d)}}if(document.body){var a=document.createElement('iframe');a.height=1;a.width=1;a.style.position='absolute';a.style.top=0;a.style.left=0;a.style.border='none';a.style.visibility='hidden';document.body.appendChild(a);if('loading'!==document.readyState)c();else if(window.addEventListener)document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',c);else{var e=document.onreadystatechange||function(){};document.onreadystatechange=function(b){e(b);'loading'!==document.readyState&&(document.onreadystatechange=e,c())}}}})();</script></body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\n",
