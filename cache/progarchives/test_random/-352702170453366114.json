Rutherford has recruited some prog heavyweights to serve as his band here: Anthony Phillips plays the Keyboards (!), Morris Pert (Brand X & later Talk Talk) provides percussion, and the estimable Simon Phillips (Eno/801, Pete Townshend, etc.) is behind the drum kit, thundering away on his trademark double bass drums. As well, Noel McCalla (otherwise unknown to me) is a fine singer. The songwriting is equally up to the high standards of the band: apart from Hackett's work, this is the best of the solo Genesis outings. In classic prog fashion, the lyrics are written around a single concept (the life of a lonely \"nobody\" in a dead-end job) and the tracks all run together. The opening \"Moonshine\" with its trademark Rutherford bass pedals, and infectious keyboards, is especially powerful, and the closing \"At the End of the Day\" is moving and anthemic. What lies between is simply very good prog, and makes SMALLCREEP'S DAY a good option for followers of Genesis, and progressive in general! </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27197#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27197\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=27197\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 29, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #27197)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n2.9999 stars really ....but not three. This album is the proof ( if needed any) that \r\nRutherford could write some good stuff , as opposed to that Special Way crap on \r\nWutherings. The stuff on this album is sometimes good ,sometimes correct but also \r\nsometimes bad. Funny thing is that the library CD copy has got the side reversed \r\ncompared to here. The overall tone of the album is a bit like Bank's Curious Feeling (but \r\nless put-me-to-sleep) and sounds a lot like Duke era material (which is of course normal \r\ngiven the dates of releases). The vocals are not very nice and some of the numbers (time \r\nand Time Again) are annoying especially on the non-suite side. As for the suite , it is easy \r\nto see that Rutherford was a full third of then Genesis . Duke (take away \r\nMisunderstanding and Turn It On again ) had some good stuff ( much better than ATTWT )\r\nthat still hinted to the better days but was also the last correct album ( along the first side \r\nof the Mama album where the Two Home By The Sea ).

The vocalist choice, Noel McCalla is a \r\nshrewd one because this guy can really sing and reaches those dizzy high peaks very \r\neasily. The album is a bit disjointed in respect that Side one on the LP is made up of 5 songs \r\nand Side 2 has the lengthy ' Small creep's day' and the final epic song ' At the end of the \r\nday' not as specified on this site as being part of the smallcreeps suite. Do not be confused \r\nbecause on the CD version they have swapped the format around, incorrectly IMO.The \r\nwhole album is strong so I am not going to point out any individual pieces. Great musicians \r\non here as well. Good to see Anthony Phillips on the keyboards.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27202#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27202\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=27202\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, September 7, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #27202)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis record is the best and the most progressive one from Mike Rutherford. Anthony \r\nPhillips on modern keyboards is a sure value: he creates addictive, memorable, \r\nintrospective and enigmatic floating atmospheres which you are never tired of. Mike's \r\nelectric guitar solos are very good and melodic, although his sound is not better than on \r\nGenesis' Duke album. Sometimes mellow & nostalgic, sometimes loaded with fast drums, this \r\nrecord can be listened from A to Z without any problem. Noel McCalla's lead vocals are \r\nEXCELLENT: he sounds a bit like Max Bacon (the GTR singer), with a much more soothing \r\nvoice. Simon Phillips' drums are very good, refined and rather complex. It is not \r\nexaggerated to say that the \"Smallcreep's day\" album slightly sounds like Genesis around \r\n1980: the difference is that it is much more progressive and less pop than Genesis. \"Time & \r\ntime again\" is a rather soft FM romantic song, as reveal the melodic piano + guitars and the \r\ntender lead vocals. All the tracks are at least very good.   <p>Rating: 4.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27204#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27204\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=27204\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, March 16, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #27204)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4324\"><strong>horza</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=4324\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20060608_133248_S1CD03.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOne of the better solo albums from the Genesis stable. Rutherford always tended to be \r\nlumped with Tony Banks as one of the quieter ones in the band and maybe not as \r\ninfluential as the others. This album tells a different story. His guitar playing on this album \r\nis confident and as restained and tasteful as Gilmour or Latimer. The compositions \r\ndemonstrate Rutherfords imprint on Genesis and the epic title track has nods towards \r\nHackett. An album worthy of purchase which also showcases an excellent choice of \r\nmusicians by Rutherford, and the singer Noel McCalla is also superb.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=50836#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=50836\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=50836\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 9, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #50836)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1117\"><strong>Cygnus X-2</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1117\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20061019_175801_Assassing1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nMike Rutherford's first and ultimately best solo album (he would release one more and\r\nthen start Mike & the Mechanics) was proof enough that he was a driving force behind\r\nGenesis' progressive sound and this album shows that he still had some left in him\r\nand that he would use his ideas to create an album with some strong more commercially\r\noriented pieces and a sprawling 24 minute epic. The first thing that you'll notice is\r\nthat Anthony Phillips is on this album, and not on the guitar like he was in Genesis.\r\nOn this album he is strictly a keyboardist and he does a fantastic job on the keys\r\ncreating lush textures on the synthesizers as well as ambitious solo sections. The\r\nrest of the band is pretty solid as well, with Simon Phillips on the drums and Noel\r\nMcCalla on vocals (his voice is pretty disctinctive and solid as well). If you're\r\ninterested in the solo careers of Genesis members then this will definitely be\r\nsomething to look out for, as it gives even some of Steve Hackett's career a run for\r\nit's money progressively.<p>The first side of the album is comprised of more commercially oriented pieces yet\r\nthey still have a distinctive and progressive flare (the instrumentation certainly\r\nhas some progressive overtones to it). The first of these songs is Moonshine. Droning\r\nsynthesizers and punchy guitars are what to expect from the song. Mike Rutherford\r\nutilizes a lot of guitars on this album, and it's very evident from the get go on\r\nthis piece. Pretty solid and punchy opener. Time and Time Again is a piano based\r\nballad that has some passionate voals from McCalla. Phillip's organ sounds give off a\r\nTony Banks vibe and the majestic mellotron work also makes it an enjoyable piece to\r\nsay the least. Rutherford's guitar solo at the end also gives shades of the style he\r\nwould unveil in the three man tenure of Genesis (he also hits a serious Hackett vibe\r\nas well). Romani begins with anxious synthesizers and hits an ambient electronic\r\natmosphere (reminds me a bit of a Klaus Schulze or Brian Eno piece only more concise\r\nand with vocals and guitars). Although it's a bit samey and sounds similar to the\r\nprevious pieces it's a pretty cool piece. Every Road is an acoustic ballad that\r\nreminds me a bit of Entangled during the chorus in terms of the progression, although\r\nthe bass is really dynamic and the piano is very melodic (and the synthesizer solo\r\ntowards the end also brings up more thoughts of Entangled). Overnight Job is the last\r\nof the regular pieces before the epic Smallcreep's Day. It's a guitar driven piece\r\nwith some solid drumming from Simon Phillips as well as a great vocal performance\r\nfrom McCalla (and Rutherford's solo is also pretty killer as well). <p>Smallcreep's Day is the second side epic that shows Rutherford still had some aces\r\nhidden up his sleeve. It has all the ingredients of a superb epic, a soft intro that\r\nlet's the keyboards explore a motif before turning into a more rocking section. On\r\nthe album, it's indexed into different tracks to make it seem more like a medley than\r\none concise piece. Between the Tick & Tock begins with a synthesizer melody that\r\nreminds me a bit of Pigs (Three Different Ones) from Pink Floyd's Animals and some\r\nexpansive and anxious synthesizers exploring a very open atmosphere before hitting\r\nthe second part, Working In Line. Working In Line has a magnificent 12 string guitar\r\nmotif as well as some majestic synthesizer leads on top. Rutherford's first of many\r\nsolos begins here, and he shows a melodic and precise performance offering a majestic\r\nand uplifting solo before entering the next section (he's a great guitarist\r\nactually). After Hours is next and it essentially is a short synthesizer based\r\ninterlude that changes the atmosphere to that of the first part of the song again.\r\nCats and Rats follows next with a walking synthesizer line and some precision\r\nrhythmic work from Simon Phillips and Mike Rutherford. Ant Phillip's first keyboard\r\nsolo is also pretty comprehensive and expansive as well.  Smallcreep Alone is another\r\nsynthesizer based interlude in the vein of After Hours and once again offers another\r\ndynamic to the overall feel of the piece. Out into the Daylight has some great\r\ndrumming from Simon Phillips as well as some more expansive synthesizers from Ant and\r\nRutherford offers a great performance on bass and guitar (although the drumming is\r\nthe real draw of this part of the piece, it goes far and beyond any other performance\r\non this album). It goes into the finale of the song and the album At the End of the\r\nDay. It ends the album on a majestic and uplifting note, hitting many different\r\nemotions (mainly because of the expressive and tasteful vocal performance from\r\nMcCalla. The keyboard solo at the end is also stunning and ends it in the same way\r\nthat Afterglow ended Wind & Wuthering (along with the epic fadeout). It's a fitting\r\nending to this great second side epic.<p>In the end, Smallcreep's Day is one of the better solo albums from a Genesis member\r\nand it's one of the better albums from 1980 that I've heard. You could still hear\r\nclassic Genesis in Mike Rutherford's first solo album, maybe it was the Ant Phillips\r\ninfluence or maybe they were ideas that weren't accepted during the A Trick of the\r\nTail- And Then There Were Three times, but whatever it is, this album is fantastic\r\nand I highly recommend it to someone wanting some fantastic music that features some\r\ninfamous musicians at a time when it looked as if their progressive edge was being\r\nlost in mediocrity. 4/5.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=87504#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=87504\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=87504\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, August 17, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #87504)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=7695\"><strong>bhikkhu</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=7695\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/7695/24_1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI had been hearing good things about this album for years. A couple of my friends had it, but I never recall \r\nit being played. We usually ended up listening to Genesis, or Peter Gabriel. I even had a copy of \"Acting \r\nVery Strange,\" but never sought this one out.<p> Last year, I came across  a copy. I listened to it several times, and nothing sunk in. I really wanted to like \r\nit, so I kept with it. Still, there was nothing that stood out. I put it away for a while, and then tried again. \r\nNothing had changed.\r\n \r\nIt's not bad. The songs are pleasant, and the playing is up to the par of a man such as Rutherford. It just \r\nseems to lack life. There is no spark, nothing to make you sit up and take notice. The songs also tend to \r\nmeander, without any solid direction. The endings don't seem to be closures, as much as the songs running \r\nout of steam.<p>I really hate to be so negative about an album that is not actually poor. I just found it very dull. If this is \r\nyour bag, enjoy. However, I can't see it being appealing to anyone but true fans.<p>H.T.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88070#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88070\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=88070\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, August 23, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #88070)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs a logical consequence of reviewing Shakary 2006, I continue my musical journey\r\nwith Mike Rutherford \"Smallcreep's Day\". Why? The lead vocal is the same: Noel\r\nMcCalla. Nothing logical, actually. But, the fact that Shakary includes Noel McCalla\r\nin Shakary 2006 reminds me this album by Mike Rutherford. Please bear in mind that\r\nthis vocal line is completely different with Shakary 2006 - it's 26 years difference\r\nin time horizon. The vocal characteristic like in this album that reminds me to Noel\r\nMcCalla's vocal tone. This album was one of excellent albums that I liked by the time\r\nthis album was released. I expected something as high quality as Genesis music to\r\nprove that Mike can compose excellent music. Yes, he has proven it. This album was\r\nbeautifully composed and it would not disappoint any Genesis fans.<p>The album (CD format) starts mellow with \"Between the Tick and The Tock\" without\r\ndrums involvement; it's basically a keyboard-based composition. The strength of this\r\nsong lies on its melody and harmony, delivered excellently with Noel's powerful and\r\nclean vocal. \"Working Line\" is an upbeat tempo track with nice acoustic guitar work\r\nand dynamic drumming. \"Cats and Rats In The Neighbourhood\" is a simple pop rock song\r\nwith nice melody and stunning keyboard. Noel sings with his tiny voice and fits with\r\nthe music.<p>The music continues with ambient mood of \"Smallcreep Alone\" followed beautifully with\r\n\"Out Into The Daylight\" which casts excellent combination of keyboard, guitar and\r\ndrums in relatively fast tempo. It reminds me to \"Duke's Travel\" of Genesis' \"Duke\"\r\nalbum. This is an excellent instrumental piece that Genesis fans would love and enjoy\r\nit very much. It's hard to differentiate this track from Genesis music. The music\r\nflows wonderfully to \"At The End of The Day\" which has excellent melody in slow tempo.  <p>The CD continues with the \"A\" side of LP format through an energetic \"Moonshine\"\r\n(6:23) with an excellent harmony. I like this track. Next track is my best favorite\r\ntrack with memorable melody \"Time and Time Again\" (4:52) which has somewhat colored\r\nmy college days at Bandung. In large or small part this track is heavily influenced\r\nby \"Many Too Many\" from Genesis \"And Then There Were Three\" album. It's a simple\r\ntrack with nice melody and powerful composition. I like the piano parts at the\r\nopening followed with Noel's nice voice \"It's been so many years since I saw your\r\nface .\" oh .. what a truly melodic segment!<p>\"Romani\" is another Genesis-influenced music followed with nice ballad \"Every Road\"\r\n(4:13). The album concludes beautifully with \"Overnight Job\" (5:43).<p>Overall, this is an excellent addition to any prog music collection. Genesis fans\r\nwould not be disappointed with this album - even, it's a must to own this album for\r\nGenesis fans. The strengths of this album are on its powerful song-writing, beautiful\r\nmelodies imposed into the music, excellent vocal job and excellent musicianship. I\r\ngot no trouble at all enjoying this album even after 26 years since its release date.\r\n<strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93849#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93849\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93849\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 9, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93849)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Curiousity</strong><p>This, the first solo album by the Genesis bassist, was released some years before his \r\nmuch more commercially successful ventures with \"Mike and the Mechanics\". Rather \r\nambitiously, he chose to fill one side of the album (on my LP, the first side) with a \r\nconcept piece, based on a day in the life of a dull individual who works on a production \r\nline without any idea of what he is actually making.<p>The \"Smallcreep's day\" side of the album is a continuous piece of music, broken into \r\ndistinct sections although there are no track markings on the vinyl. The \r\nopening \"Between the tick and the tock\" is a downbeat, reflective number which has \r\nechoes of Tony Banks' similarly timed first solo album \"A curious feeling\". The second \r\nsection, \"Waiting in line\" is the most commercial part of the piece, and was almost a hit \r\nsingle. Noel McCalla's vocals here are distinguished and appropriate, thank goodness \r\nMike resisted the urge to sing (he would find that urge too powerful on his next solo \r\nalbum). Former band mate Anthony Phillips contributes some fine keyboard work, \r\nsometimes as backing <I>sounds</I> but often to the fore such as on the \"Lamb..\" \r\nsounding \"Cats and rats\" and the excellent \"Out in the daylight\", where he sounds very \r\n<I>Banksian</I>. <p>The suite closes with the touching ballad \"At the end of the day\", where McCalla's \r\nsympathetic performance sees him displaying his full vocal range backed by some \r\nwonderfully atmospheric keyboard and guitar motifs. <p>Side two of the album consists of more orthodox pop rock songs, most of which would \r\nhave suited Genesis albums \"Duke\" or \"And then there were three\". \r\nIndeed, \"Smallcreep's day\" was released between those albums, so these songs may \r\neven have been submitted by Rutherford for consideration for them. <p>\"Moonshine\" is a rather nondescript rambling piece, with Tony Banks inspired \r\nsynthesiser driving it along. \"Time and time again\" is an excellent ballad, which once \r\nagain has the feel of Tony Banks' \"A curious feeling\" (which <I>curiously</I> was \r\nrecorded in the same studios at the same time. Note also that the central theme \r\nof \"Smallcreep's day is curiosity!). The remaining songs are adequate but \r\nordinary, and certainly overshadowed by the revese side of the LP.<p>In some ways, \"Smallcreep's day\" is a bit of a \"Tarkus\", with the title suite occupying \r\nthe whole of one side, and completely overshadowing the other side. Like \"Tarkus\" the \r\ntracks on the second side do have some merit, but they are significantly inferior when \r\ncompared to the album's focal point. <p>An essential album for the suite which gives the album its title. The LP represents \r\nexcellent value too, running for over 50 minutes.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94482#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94482\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=94482\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 14, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #94482)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9836\"><strong>tszirmay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9836\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/9836/Roxy.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBefore venturing off into Popland , leading his way too clean Mechanics and the once great \r\nGenesis to dizzying commercial success, Rutherford used his Rickenbakers wisely on the \r\nAnthony Phillips debut \"The Geese and the Ghost\" and on this, his first solo album. \r\nThankfully, we have these testaments to treasure , this one in particular is a fine collection \r\nespecially at a time (1980) when Prog was being brutally assassinated by the Lester Bangs \r\nand assorted British punk-journalists (none of whom had talent musically or in penmanship!)\r\nof the world, imposing their rather poor taste in music and forcing Prog's extended but \r\ntemporary hibernation (Video killed the radio star but punk didn't kill the Progster!).While no \r\nrecord executive was looking, Rutherford was free to delve into the musical adaptation of a \r\nbook by Currell Brown , enlisting his good friend (and ours too) Anthony Phillips to chair the \r\nkeys , as well as another famed Phillips :drummer extraordinaire Simon (no relation to the \r\nAnt), as well as one of the best movers and shakers in percussionist Morris Pert . The \r\nvocals are well piped by former String Driven Thing Noel McCalla and guitars and basses \r\nhandled by the leader.

But \r\nmore than Banks A Curious Feeling, Smallcreep\u00b4s Day reflects a lot what was happening to Genesis at the end of the 70's: half the album is \r\ntruly progressive music (the title track suite with its 24:38 time). The other half it\u00b4s pop music (with some prog overtones). Very much like\r\nGenesis Duke. And I must say I always liked it. Specially if you compare this one with his ludicrous second efford, the very forgetable \r\nActing Very Strange.<p>First he put together an excellent team of musicians that included an ex Genesis axeman, Anthony Philips (now playing keyboards! \r\nand doing a fine job), England\u00b4s best studio drummer in the 70\u00b4s (Simon Phillips), a jazz rock percussionist (Morris Pert) and an old \r\nfriend who once sang with the proto Genesis during school days (Noel McCalla). Songwriting wise, Rutherford proves he can write \r\nsome decent symphonic tunes along with his obvious pop leanings. Fortunatly he does not sing on this one, McCalla\u00b4s choice being a \r\nvery fitting one: he has a fine voice and his interpretations are very emotional and convincing. As for Rutherford himself he sticks to \r\nhis guns, adding some nice solos here and there, emulating Steve Hackett\u00b4s style very well.<p>Certainly for progheads the title track is the true gem of the album, and I agree.. But the other songs are also fine. Pop songs \r\nalright, but sophisticated pop, tasteful and well arranged.  An album I can hear from beginning to end without skipping a single track. \r\nIf you like Genesis around the Wind and Wuthering era, you\u00b4ll probably love this album.<p>A little piece of trivia here: my old LP had the suite on the first side and the other tracks on the b side. it works better that way. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=131427#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=131427\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=131427\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, August 2, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #131427)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1818\"><strong>Matti</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1818\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1818/bruegel-snow.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nRutherford's first solo project came between And Then There Were Three and Duke by GENESIS. And a pretty good album this is. \r\nThe group is perfect for this occasion: Noel McCalla (too unknown talent) on vocals, Morris Pert on percussion, Simon Phillips (who's \r\nheard on many Oldfield albums) on drums, and the old band mate Anthony Phillips (who left Genesis before really showing his multi-\r\ninstrumental and writing skills) on keyboards. Mike naturally plays both guitars and basses. Production is modern and clean, more or \r\nless like on the mentioned Genesis albums.<p>\r\nRutherford is the most AOR type of a songwriter in the Genesis camp, as was later demonstrated with Mike + The Mechanics. The \r\npop songs of Side One are accessible AOR stuff, resembling more of the future eighties than the bygone seventies, but fairly \r\nlistenable anyhow. Side Two is filled by a 7-part title epic of equally accessible 'prog pop'; that is, there are no majestic solos or other \r\nprog rock trademarks, it's just a narrative entity segued together. It works very well as it moves between various atmospheres. It's \r\nabout a factory worker who tries to reveal the secrets behind the producing line. <p>\r\nFor a collector of GENESIS-related stuff this offers a nice addition the same way as Tony Banks' debut A Curious Feeling (both being \r\nthe only good albums in their solo discographies).</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=141460#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=141460\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=141460\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 2, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #141460)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=378\"><strong>Cesar Inca</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nStrange how unpredictable art is regarding the momentum of an individual's inspiration: such is the \r\ncase that brings us to the review for this Mike Rutherford's solo effort. Even though Rutherford had \r\nbeen responsible for some of the most progressively relevant passages in Genesis' history, he was \r\nusually surpassed by Banks' majestic vision and Hackett's texturial signature inputs. Outside Genesis, \r\nbesides extensively collaborating as a musician and even sharing some writing credits for Hackett's and \r\nAnthony Phillips' debut solo efforts, prog fans were not in touch with what Rutherford could bring by \r\nhimself to the prog genre until the release of his solo debut \"Smallcreep's Day\". It was amazing!! It still \r\nsounds amazing after all these years, typically Genesis-related in terms of overall sound and \r\ncompositional moods - generally speaking, this album reinstates the serene density of \"Wind & \r\nWuthering\" and the best elements of \".And Then There Were Three\". The dynamics and colorfulness \r\ndelivered through the repertoire in such a way that it overshadows Tony Banks' \"A Curious Feeling\"; for \r\nthe more lyrical passages in the album, Rutherford almost equals the magic of the romantic pieces \r\nfrom Hackett's \"Please, Don't Touch\". The presence of a particularly special guest, Anthony Phillips, on \r\nkeyboards is peculiar for many reasons: he reveals himself as a proficient keyboardsman who comes \r\nas no second to fellow Genesis founder Tony Banks. In fact, Phillips steals the limelight with his \r\nkeyboard inputs in many moments. Noel McCalla is also vital for the delivery of the sung tracks' \r\nmoods: his tone and timber, which remind us of Michael Sadler-meets-Graham Bonnet, feels at ease \r\nwith his versatile AOR-like singing. Whenever things get cooking, the duo of drummer Simon Phillips \r\nand percussionist Morris Pert help things breathe and tighten up. The namesake suite open up the \r\noriginal British album with a first section deeply rooted in ethereal atmospheres, featuring lush \r\nkeyboard layers and harmonies under which soft classical guitar arpeggios flow by. Part 2 'Waiting in \r\nLine' is a catchy yet subtly exercise on melodic prog that may remind us of the best aspects from late \r\n70s Camel and Oldfield: a revamped version of this song with a repeated vocal part was released as a \r\nsingle. Among all the straightforward balladic, post-punk and new wave singles, I remember feeling \r\ncaptivated whenever they played this one on the radio (years before becoming the prog freak that I \r\nam). The remaining sections are diversified enough as to comprise eerie interludes (III & V); prog pop \r\n(IV, which sounds like a younger brother of 'Man of Our Times' from \"Duke\"); a bombastic Hackett-like \r\ninstrumental (VI); and finally, the hypnotic pompous ballad 'At the End of the Day', which delivers a \r\nsense of grayish romanticism where optimism and pessimism fuse into one single feeling. Moments like \r\nthis showcase the Hackett similarities that I mentioned earlier in this review. The album's second half \r\ngets started with the muscular mid-tempo 'Moonshine', a song that the guys of Saga in their pre-\"Heads \r\nor Tales\" era would have been proud of. 'Time and Time Again' is a beautiful ballad, perhaps in the \r\nmould of Banks' 'Many Too Many' and 'Undertow', yet providing a fuller sound and a more vibrant \r\nmood: the predominance of the keyboards' inputs is crucially essential for this. Beautiful indeed, it \r\nsends me chills just by singing it in my mind. The other ballad 'Every Road' is focused on the acoustic \r\nguitars, sounding closely related to the Anthony Phillips legacy. Between the two, 'Romani' is yet \r\nanother \"W&W\"-meets-\"ATTWT\" sort of song, exploring a clever alternation of 5/4 and 4/4 tempos in a \r\nvery fluid manner. The closer 'Overnight Job' is a fine rocker, with an interesting melodic nucleus, yet \r\nevidently less impressive than any of the four preceding pieces. It is a nice closure, but it wouldn't have \r\nhurt if any other track would have been chosen to fill this position: maybe the whole suite, as it appears \r\nin the US edition? All in all, \"Smallcreep's Day\" is a great item in any good prog rock collection. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=183218#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=183218\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=183218\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 22, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #183218)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nLot's of four and five stars for this album. Huuum?<p>I wouldn't be that generous. Some OAR oriented songs, like ''Moonshine''; but remember this \r\nwas released in 1980. It holds some ''Squonk'' values and is an average + opener; but no \r\nmore.<p>Some songs (or parts) of this album sounds rather popish like ''Time & Time Again''. This was \r\nthe mood of the year I would say. No harm but no big thing either. The real harm is reached \r\nwith the weak ''Romani''. Actually, most of the first side of this LP isn't really outstanding in \r\nterms of prog to be honest (cf. ''Overnight Job'').<p>This album do share a lot of the music available while the band were only three. The epic that \r\nresides here sounds too much though as a combination of several songs rather than a \r\nsmooth genuine epic. There are some fine moments and the whole is by far the best available \r\non this creep's thing.<p>The opening '' Between the Tick and the Tock'' has definitely inspired ''Marillion'' (the genuine \r\none of course) in their early days and is one the finest part of this work; plenty of emotion and \r\ntalent.<p>''Cats & Rats'' does have a solid ''When They Were Three'' feel (again) which is far from being \r\nbad. At this time, it is about normal to say that the lead singer doesn't perform a great job. I \r\nquite like the instrumental parts: ''Smallcreep Alone'' which is quite melodic or the very ''Wind & \r\nWuthering'' number called ''Out Of The Daylight''.<p>Don't worry though: this album which was released in 198 has much more to deal with ''Duke'' \r\nthan with ''Abacab'' if you see what I mean. As such, I would rate it with three stars: a good \r\nalbum which features some fine moments. But by no means a masterpiece. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220608#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220608\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=220608\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 10, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #220608)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Rutherford's Day</strong><p>This first solo album by Mike Rutherford features Mike on guitars and bass, another Genesis member of the past in Anthony Phillips on keyboards, Simon Phillips on drums and Noel McCalla on vocals. The vocals are often rather soulful and soothing. The style of music involved is a kind of diluted Genesis of the And Then There Were Three and Duke era. I am a fan of those Genesis albums, but Smallcreep's Day, though a good album in its own right, is hardly up to the standards of those Genesis albums. Any claim to the effect that Smallcreep's Day is 'the lost Genesis album' is without merit in my opinion.<p>The compositions range from decent to good and the quality of the songs are quite evenly spread over the album's running time. The second vinyl side (the <em>first</em> side on some releases, I believe) is taken up by a continuous piece of music. It is rather good and fully listenable, but it is not very memorable. This long piece, as the album as a whole, has progressive moments and some soulful Pop moments. <p>In the end, I believe that this album will appeal to fans of post-Steve Hackett Genesis.

It's much more 'Duke' than 'Nursery \r\nCryme', and the music shares a lot of similarities with 'Mike & The Mechanics', the \r\ncommercially-successful band Rutherford would create several years down to give him an \r\noutlet for his burgeoning solo work. It's all very light, with ballads and workmanlike pop the \r\norder of the day, but a couple tracks do deserve faint praise, such as the atmospheric opener \r\n'Between The Tick & The Tock', which showcases Rutherford's impressive keyboards skills, \r\nand the fist-pumping rocker 'Moonshine', which is genuinely anthemic, featuring a pulsating \r\nbeat, hard-edged guitars and impressive vocal harmonies a la Foreigner circa their '4' years. \r\nAs a piece of prog, however, 'Smallcreep's Day' is fundamentally limited by Rutherford's \r\nsimplistic approach, and fans of Genesis will probably find very little of interest. The album's \r\nlead single, the jangly, guitar-led 'Waiting In Line', is a perfect example of Rutherford's style, \r\ngiving the album a brash and breezy feel similar to the disposable chart-pop that would soon \r\ndominate the eighties. \r\nLimited stuff then, 'Smallcreep's Day' should appeal to Mike & The Mechanics fans, and will \r\nappeal to die-hard fans of the Genesis guitarist.\r\nSTEFAN TURNER, LONDON, 2010\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=293643#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=293643\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=293643\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, August 6, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #293643)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10853\"><strong>octopus-4</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>RIO/Avant/Zeuhl,Neo &amp; Post/Math Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10853\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10853/octopus_wallpaper.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI'm everything but a Genesis fan so it may seem strange that I like this one very much. If it \r\nwasn't for the vocals one could easily think that it's Genesis, but it's probably the absence of \r\nPhil Collins that makes it very appealing to me.<p>Of course I like the B side more than the A (I have it on vimyl, of course). The A side is just \r\nquestion of some disconnected songs, some of them nice, but none is a masterpiece.<p>\"Moonshine\" is a song that makes clear that this is a sort of lost Genesis album on which \r\nNoel McCalla sings midway between Gabriel and Collins. I like his voice, anyway. I think it's \r\none of the best things of the album, really an added value. The song itself is good but non-\r\nessential, better in the slow chorus than in the uptime parts.<p>\"Time and Time Again\" is a sweet pop song in Collins' style, but also here McCalla \r\ntransforms an average pop song into something special. <p>\"Romani\" is the song that I like less. After a symphonic intro it turns to be a missing Peter \r\nGabriel's song. Not a bad song but it's only Genesis of the 80s.<p>\"Every Road\" is a missing Phil Collins song, instead. A sort of follow-up to Time and Time \r\nAgain. Is it possible that Maike Rutherford is not able to make something \"personal\"? Just \r\nwait for the B side. By now this is another poppy sweet song with good vocals and the \r\nacoustic guitar reminiding more of Anthony Phillips than of Steve Hackett.<p>If I like less Romani, I'm used to skip \"Overnight Job\", so I suspect that a true Genesis fan \r\nwould like it. Also this song is improved by the vocals, anyway.<p>Now the suite. It could have been a full concept album and it's a pity that Mike Rutherford \r\nhas limited his effort to 20 minutes. An extended version of this epic to cover both the sides \r\nwould have make of this album a masterpiece. The seven parts of it are strictly connected, \r\nthe story is consistent and moving. It has good lyrics, too and make the A side appear like a \r\ncollection of fillers. I remember myself listening to it for the first time on tape and playing \r\ncontinuosly the second half of the suite before going to purchase the album. \"At The End Of \r\nThe Day\" deserves a remark, but all the suite can be intended as a single long song. Surely \r\nMarillion have been influenced by it when they composed Misplaced Childhood. \r\n30 years after is still an album that I like to listen and I find that it's not so dependent by the \r\ntime of release like other albums from the 80s are. It's full of the typical Genesis sound, not \r\nof the boring 80s fairlights and even if I usually don't like Genesis much, this is an album I \r\nwould never get rid of. <p>The A side is a 3-stars collection of songs, the B side is a masterpiece so 4-stars.\r\n <p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=443040#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=443040\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=443040\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, May 5, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #443040)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=997\"><strong>Guillermo</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=997\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070426_101555_eclipse-mex-110.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis first solo album by Mike Rutherford is much better than his second solo album (\"Acting Very \r\nStrange\" from 1982), and it really a very Progressive Rock album with some Pop Rock influences. \r\nIt was recorded during 1979, a year on which the members of Genesis took a hiatus from activities \r\nas a band, maybe to take a rest, but also due to Phil Collins`s  personal problems with his marriage \r\nwhich he tried to resolve without success during that time and which finally ended with his first \r\ndivorce. So, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks took that time out of the band to record their first solo \r\nalbums that year, while Collins worked a bit with the band Brand X releasing a new album \r\ntitled \"Product\" and also working in the studio with Peter Gabriel for Gabriel`s third solo album \r\nwhich was released in 1980 (plus an appearance with Gabriel as part of his band a the Reading \r\nFestival also in 1979). Both this album and Banks`solo album (\"A Curious Feeling\") were recorded \r\nat ABBA`s Polar Studios in Stockholm but I don`t know if both were recorded at almost the same \r\ntime, but  I doubt it. Banks`s solo album was released first, in October 1979, while Rutherford`s \r\nwas released until January 1980. By late October of that year Genesis started rehearsing and \r\ncomposing new songs for their new album titled \"Duke\", which also was going to be recorded at \r\nPolar Studios and also was produced by David Hentschel like both solo albums. \"Duke\" was \r\nreleased in March 1980 and then Genesis toured again unitl June 1980.<p>For his first solo album Rutherford had some very good musicians, like drummer Simon Phillips, \r\nformer Genesis member Anthony Phillips on keyboards, Noel McCalla on  vocals and Morris Pert \r\non percussion. The long suite titled \"Smallcreep`s Day\" is very good sounding a lot like Genesis in \r\nsome parts, but my favourite part from  it is the last which is titled as \"At the End of the Day\". \r\nPhillips is a good keyboard player playing very good keyboards atmospheres particularly during \r\nthis last part of the suite.  The suite is very good as a whole but a bit long (at almost 25 minutes in \r\nduration).<p>I prefer the rest of the songs which are shorter and more varied in styles. I can hear to some \r\ninlfuences from Camel, particularly in some arrangements and in some parts Noel McCalla`s \r\nvocals sound a bit like Chris Rainbow`s from the Alan Parsons Project and Camel. I think that \r\nMcCalla  is a very good singer and that Rutherford had the very good idea to have this singer for \r\nthis album. McCalla`s vocals also sound a bit similar to the vocals of future lead \r\nsinger of \"Mike and the Mechanics\", the late Paul Young.<p>With this solo album from Rutherford, with Banks `\"A Curious Feeling\" solo album, and with \r\nGenesis`s \"Duke\" album I can hear some of  the musical transitions that  the members of the band \r\nwere doing from the music of the seventies to the music of the eighties: they were still retaining \r\nsome of the Prog Rock influences while still incorporating new sounds and more influences from \r\nPop Rock music. So, Rutherford`s guitar playing was moving more to the use of distorted electric \r\nguitars and guitar riffs than to the use of arpeggios which were more characteristic to the sound of \r\nGenesis`s music during the seventies. He still uses the bass pedals in several parts.<p>Thi is a very good solo album by Mike Rutherford. Mostly Progressive Rock in style.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1086155#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1086155\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1086155\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 5, 2013</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4450#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1086155)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=56081\"><strong>VianaProghead</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=56081\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/1/cover_404762112008.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" title=\"VianaProghead avatar\" width=100 alt=\"VianaProghead avatar\" onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n                                   Review N\u00ba 597<p>As many of we know, Mike Rutherford is one of the founding members of Genesis with Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks \r\nand Anthony Phillips. Along with Banks he was the only band's member to belong to Genesis throughout their \r\nentire musical history. Initially, in Genesis, Rutherford was the bassist of the band but with the departure of Hackett \r\nof the group, he took also the guitarist duties. His guitar style isn't considered as technical as Hackett's, still he has a \r\nguitar style with some harmony and creativity. While touring, Rutherford switches between bass and guitar with the \r\nAmerican guest musician Daryl Stuermer. The bass line of Rutherford is known for being well done and with great \r\ninnovation and technical base, having been prominent in the movement of progressive rock. Rutherford also \r\nexceeded as a performer of 12 string guitar and backing vocals on Genesis. However, he described his playing as \r\naverage and said that he always considered himself as a songwriter, first and foremost. He also collaborated on \r\nsome albums with other artists.<p>After the release of Genesis' ninth studio album \"And Then There Were Three?\" released in 1978, during the \r\nmusical hiatus of Genesis, Rutherford recorded two solo albums, \"Smallcreep's Day\" in 1980 and \"Acting Very \r\nStrange\" in 1982, and he also created and leads the AOR band Mike And The Mechanics with a great and enviable \r\ncommercial success.<p>The line up on \"Smallcreep's Day\" is Mike Rutherford (guitar and basses), Anthony Phillips (keyboards), Noel McCalla \r\n(vocals), Simon Phillips (drums) and Morris Pert (percussion).<p>As I wrote above, \"Smallcreep's Day\" is his debut solo studio album and was released in 1980. The album is divided \r\ninto two distinct parts. The first part is a conceptual piece of music where the title suite occupies all the A side of the \r\noriginal vinyl disc. It's based on the dark and surrealist novel of the same name by Peter Currell Brown. The second \r\npart occupies the entire B side of the vinyl disc and waith a handful of five individual songs without common points.\r\n\"Smallcreep's Day\" has six tracks, all written by Rutherford. The title track suite \"Smallcreep's Day\" is divided in \r\nseven parts: \"Between The Tick & The Tock\", \"Working In Line\", \"After Hours\", \"Cats And Rats (In This \r\nNeighbourhood)\", \"Smallcreep Alone\", \"Out Into The Daylight\" and \"At The End Of The Day\". As I said before, this \r\npiece is based on a novel with the same name by Peter Currell Brown edited in 1965. The story is a surreal satire on \r\nthe modern industrial life. The book explores some of the author's ideas about human relationships, freedom and \r\nthe values of the human life. Some passages on the book are hilarious, some depressing and some macabre. About \r\nthe music itself, I can say that it has many elements of Genesis' early progressive sound and that it's truly a \r\nprogressive music piece. In reality, there is nothing to be in debt to some of the best musical moments produced by \r\nGenesis in all their musical history, and for that reason, it deserves to be considered truly a masterpiece. The \r\nsecond part has the five songs mentioned by me. They're all more guided into a pop style and in general they have \r\nless quality. \"Moonshine\" and \"Time And Time Again\" are the best. \"Moonshine\" has lots of bass, bombastic \r\nkeyboard cascades that remind me \"Behind The Lines\". This is a pretty and solid track with an excellent harmony. \r\n\"Time And Time Again\" is a nice song pleasantly sung by Noel. The chorus breaks out of the melancholy with some \r\noptimism. The middle section of the song has a nice brief solo by Mike. This is another good song. \"Romani\" has \r\ninteresting vocals and rhythmic niceties like frequent changes in signatures and speed making it enjoyable. This is \r\nthe typical Rutherford's songwriting that  sounds clever and ease. \"Every Road\" is carried mainly by the acoustic \r\nguitar. It sounds like a symbiosis of \"Over My Shoulder\" and \"Open Door\" and spreads some good vibrations along \r\nthe way. \"Overnight Job\" is a dynamic song. In the middle the song changes directions completely and proves yet \r\nagain one of the Mike's strengths lies in writing strong and catchy riffs.<p>Conclusion: What remains to me is the overall impression this is an album of Genesis under an assumed name, if \r\nyou don't count the five individual tracks. The title track \"Smallcreep's Day\" reaches a length of 25 minutes and it \r\ncan perfectly replaced \"Supper's Ready\" as the lengthiest Genesis' related piece of music ever made by them. \r\nHowever, as I wrote before, we have to separate the two parts of the album. The first part is a masterpiece but the \r\nsecond part has in general slightly lower quality and isn't progressive. As our colleague Easy Livin noted, and I fully \r\nagree with him, there are many similarities between \"Smallcreep's Day\" and \"Tarkus\" of Emerson, Lake & Palmer. I \r\nalso would add \"2112\" of Rush. The similarities aren't, of course, on the type of the music but how the album was \r\nmade. On all these three albums, the side A is a masterpiece but the side B has significantly an inferior quality level. \r\nUnfortunately, because the differences between the two sides on the album, \"Smallcreep's Day\" is somewhat an \r\nunbalanced album. Because of that it failed to be a masterpiece, being only a half-masterpiece as \"Tarkus\" and \r\n\"2112\". It deserves the same 4 stars.<p>Prog is my Ferrari.
