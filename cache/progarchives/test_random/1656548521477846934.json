I immediately called the station and got the song title and artist: It was\r\n\"Flight of Icarus\" from Iron Maiden \"Piece of Mind\". What an excellent song! To me,\r\nmusic is emotion and \"Flight of Icarus\" was successful in creating that emotion to me\r\nregardless the sub-genre of the music - and I didn't care, really. So I purchased the\r\nCD and I played track 3 repetitively - probably 6 to 8 spins only for track 3. Why do\r\nI like the track? It's really great music combining excellent guitar riffs, dynamic\r\nbass lines and great double guitar work. The vocal part is really clean and powerful.\r\nAnd of course. the chorus line is so memorable .\"Fly on your way, like an eagle. Fly\r\nas high as the sun, on your way, like an eagle. Fly and touch the sun.\". Wow! What a\r\ngreat music segment this one is!<p>\"Brave New World\" is the second CD that I purchased from Iron Maiden. It was\r\ninfluenced by friends of mine who at that time about Year 2000 / 2001 hung out\r\ntogether with me at the M97 Classic Rock Station in Jakarta. Mbah Sigit, my friend\r\nwho'd been labeled as metalhead and die-hard fan of Iron Maiden from its inception,\r\ntold me that \"Brave New World\" remarks the return of IrMa legendary vocalist Bruce\r\nDickinson. So what? I did not know exactly but I purchased the CD anyway. To my\r\nsurprise, it blew me away at first listen! The band is now six-piece with triple\r\nguitars. What a waste! What for hiring another guitarist while two is good enough?\r\nWell, I don't know. It's not my business anyhow.<p>The album opens nicely with straight rocker \"The Wicker Man\" with memorable lyrics\r\n\"Your time will come\". The following track \"Ghost of the Navigator\" is truly an\r\nenergetic and impressive track. I like the combination of electric guitar rhythm,\r\nhigh register notes vocal line, and . stunning guitar solo. The band's mastermind,\r\nSteve Harris, also plays distinctive bass guitar. This is an excellent rock music\r\nthat most rockers would adore.  It's one of my favorite IrMa tracks. By this time I\r\nremember vividly how one of the bands that contributed to our regular monthly jam\r\nsession <strong>i-Rock! Threelogy</strong> played wonderful cover of Iron Maiden.\r\n\"Brave New World\" is another excellent track with good melody, harmony and stunning\r\nguitar solo. Structurally, this track might be considered as prog - it's about 10%\r\ncontent only.<p>\"Blood Brothers\" is truly a prog track with excellent composition. It starts with\r\ngreat bassline and guitar. I really love this track as it has rich nuances with key\r\nrhythm section in the vein of Scotland traditional music. The flow of music is\r\nwonderful from start to end of the track. This is one of my favorite IrMa tracks!\r\n\"The Mercenary\" brings the music back to heavy stuff with great vocal line. \"Dream of\r\nMirrors\" is another great track with prog elements even from start of the track where\r\nthe music starts and stops immediately, allowing acoustic guitar to appear. The\r\nopening part is excellently and I cannot believe that band like IrMa opens the song\r\nwith such style. It then moves to heavy music with higher vocal notes and rockin'\r\nrhythm section. \"The dream is true .\" segment reminds me to the music of\r\n<strong>Uriah Heep</strong> - David Byron era. Oh man .. I don't really care this\r\nband is prog or not but Iron Maiden really ruleszzzzz ...!!!! Sorry, in my locality\r\nexpression I label it as <strong>top markotop!</strong> (meaning: top of the line! -\r\nin rock music, of course).<p>\"The Fallen Angel\" is another rocker with again with dynamic beats demonstrating\r\nexcellent drumming, tight basslines and excellent guitar work. Judging from the\r\nduration of 9 minues, next track \"The Nomad\" is a prog one. Yes, my friend told me\r\njokingly if a track consumes more than 8 minutes duration, it must be a prog song!\r\nBut indeed, this track is prog one if I look at the non-linear structure and varied\r\ntextures. Composition-wise, this is an excellent track. The long duration does not\r\ncreate any sense of getting bored with the stream of music this track is offering. I\r\nlike the music interlude at approx minute 4:45 when the music turns mellow with bass\r\nguitar gives its fills combined with guitar. It's so cool man! Wow .!!! AT minute\r\n5:45 (approx) the music turns symphonic at its best! I never believe Iron Maiden\r\nplays this kind of music! It's brilliant! Where is your music sense if you cannot\r\nenjoy this part, my friend?! Tell me! I'm totally <strong>nggeblak!</strong> (my mind\r\nis temporarily paralyzed enjoying the stream of music this track is offering).<p>\"Out of The Silent Planet\" starts wonderfully with combine guitars work. The music\r\nthen flows in hard and heavy style, delivering powerful vocal line of Bruce Dickinson\r\nwhich sometimes augmented with backing vocals. The guitar solo parts at interlude are\r\nstunning. The album concludes beautifully with \"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\"\r\nin straight hard rock style.<p>Overall, this album is a masterpiece of rock music: great songwriting, tight\r\ncomposition and great performance. Of course this is a masterpiece product because\r\nit's produced by <strong>Kevin Shirley</strong> and co-produced by <strong>Steve\r\nHarris</strong> (the band's mastermind and bass guitar player). This album has\r\nsuccessfully stirred my emotion up - regardless being prog or not (who actually\r\ncares?). Even though I consider IrMa is a hard rock / metal band, but this album has\r\nat least 40% prog ingredients. This album is good to pump up your emotion and\r\nmotivation. <strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93729#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93729\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93729\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 8, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93729)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10301\"><strong>evenless</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter reading many reviews on www.progarchives.com I decided to buy SOMEWHERE \r\nIN TIME, POWERSLAVE, 7TH SON OF A 7TH SON and BRAVE NEW WORLD all at once. <p>Why the heck didn't I discover IRON MAIDEN in the eighty's already? Maybe it was \r\nbecause I was rejecting the guys (and girls) who were rejecting everything that society \r\nhad to offer. Usually those guys, dressed in their torn jeans, MAIDEN shirts,\r\nleather metal pin bracelets and sometimes even wearing dog belts weren't really the \r\nguys I was identifying myself with. Hence: I wasn't listening to \"their music\" either. Now \r\nI must admit: \"what a shame!\"<p>Maybe I still don't really like IRON MAIDEN's earliest albums (I wouldn't know cuz I \r\nhaven't checked them out yet.), but I find the previously mentioned albums all very \r\ngood and BRAVE NEW WORLD even excellent! Most songs are long compositions with a \r\nvery \"proggy feel\" to them.<p>In this album you will certainly hear MAIDEN's \"Prog roots\". I think BRAVE NEW WORLD \r\nis the album MAIDEN always wanted to make, but in their early years they couldn't pull \r\nit off yet. THE WICKER MAN is a good up-tempo rock song and I really love the proggy \r\nkeyboard intro of GHOST OF THE NAVIGATOR after which the song is transforming into \r\nanother great rock track with massive guitars and once again the operatic voice of \r\nBRUCE DICKINSON.  The title track BRAVE NEW WORLD is possibly the best track of \r\nthe album: very catchy chorus which will make you sing along in no time flat. I certainly \r\nalso love BLOOD BROTHERS. This song kind of takes you back to the time of the knights \r\nof the round table and minstrel boys. Great fun!<p>Also funny to know is the reason why BRUCE DICKINSON wasn't present on THE X-\r\nFACTOR and VIRTUAL XI. Around this time BRUCE started out a second career as an \r\nairline pilot and he's happily flying around in a Boeing 737 for a UK based charter \r\ncompany right now combining his piloting with singing for MAIDEN. The fellow airline \r\npilots (like myself) are probably his biggest fans! <p>I could go on reviewing this album track by track, but what's the point as no track is \r\nbad, maybe there's just one track a bit weaker than the other. Over all an astonishing \r\nalbum! I didn't get to know MAIDEN as a rebellious teenager, but I'm glad I got to know \r\nmaiden at the age of 35. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=100115#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=100115\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=100115\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, November 23, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #100115)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n3.5 Stars<p>Iron Maiden's come back!! The classic line-up is here but with an extra guitar\r\nplayer, Janick Gers. The music sounds confident and shows that the band still knows\r\nhow to play together as a band. It is of no wonder why Iron Maiden celebrated while\r\nhearing the music of \"Brave New World\": Iron Maiden may be old, but their inspiration\r\nis not gone and they returned to where they left off in Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\r\nYes, that means an album with touches of prog.<p>The album begins with <strong> Wicker Man </strong>, a straightforward opener with a catchy\r\nguitar riff in the choruses. Nothing special. I think the album begins properly with\r\n<strong> Ghost of the Navigator </strong> with good melodies, tempo changes, excellent vocals\r\n(I missed Dickinson!), and inspired guitar playing. <strong> Brave New World </strong> begins\r\nand ends with a melodic soft section, an Iron Maiden trademark. The song is solid and\r\ncontains great vocal performances from Bruce, showing that his voice hasn't\r\ndeteriorated with the passage of time. <strong> Blood Brothers </strong> begins with an\r\nirresistible melody and then leads into a great song which is undoubtedly my favorite\r\ntune here. The choruses are very memorable. After a guitar solo, a more symphonic\r\nsection makes up the second half of the song. This section shows that Iron Maiden is\r\nprogressing from where they left off in Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. <strong> The\r\nMercenary </strong> is straightforward and very repetitive, making this a low point of the\r\nalbum. <strong> Dream of Mirrors </strong> is a very sophisticated song clocking at over 9\r\nminutes. It has a very inspired soft arrangement throughout most of the first half\r\nand the song seems to have two types of choruses: a soft one and a heavier one \"I\r\nonly dream in black and white\". The second half is faster-paced and both halves show\r\nsome of the best vocals from Dickinson. <strong> The Fallen Angel </strong> is another sort of\r\nstraightforward hard rock tune with its solos after the second chorus, the last one\r\nbeing the best of them. <strong> The Nomad </strong> is an attempt at creating an epic. It is\r\ncloser in style to \"Alexander the Great\". Its verses/choruses play with arabic scales\r\nand are the least enjoyable moments of the song due to the lack of inspiration in the\r\narabic guitar riffs and the choruses. However, there is a magnificent bunch of solos\r\naround minute 3 and the instrumental section on crescendo is one of Iron Maiden's\r\nmost inspired moments musically in my opinion. Very symphonic and melodic, it recalls\r\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son at its best. <strong> Out of the Silent Planet </strong> is a\r\ncatchy fast-paced rocker that exceeds the duration it needs in my opinion, being\r\nquite repetitive. <strong> The Thin Line Between Love and Hate </strong> is another epic that\r\nin my opinion is not as captivating as the previous two longer songs of this album.\r\nIt has some inspired moments throughout but for me is one of the least memorable\r\nsongs of the album. The second half is pretty good though and manages to end the\r\nalbum in a strong note.<p>Anyways, to sum up, this is a solid 3.5 star album with the classic line-up. The\r\nsongs range from mainstream fast-paced repetitive rockers to elaborated prog-metal\r\nepics and some songs in between (accessible melodic mid-lengthed tunes like the title\r\ntrack). This may not be Iron Maiden's strongest album, but man, isn't it good to hear\r\nthat they are back in the act and releasing quality music? The following albums are\r\nbetter, and I am very excited to hear what may be next.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=105071#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=105071\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=105071\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, December 31, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #105071)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11104\"><strong>1800iareyay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBrave New World marks the return of vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guiatrist Adrian Smith to \r\nIron Maiden. The lads in the band were nice enough to not sack Adrian's replacement, \r\nJanick Gers. After all, Janick had been with the band for a decade. Thus, Iron Maiden \r\nmanaged to return to the classic lineup and yet morph into the Lynrd Skynyrd of metal, \r\nwith three of the top guitarists in metal in one non shred band. Maiden fans as well as fans \r\nof metal in general were salivating at the prospects of the reenergized band. The result \r\nwas Brave New World, a step in the right direction away from the previous Blaze Bayley \r\nalbums as well as No Prayer and Fear of the Dark. <p>The album opens with The Wicker Man, the most rocking Maiden tune since Aces High. \r\nBruce's voice isn't the piercing siren it once was, but I defend his \"matured\" vocals; they \r\nstill get you pumping like few singers can. Riff-heavy and straight-foward, but great. This \r\nis the most straight-forward song on the album. BNW is Maiden's most proggy album to \r\ndate, even more so than the synth-in-metal experiment gone great 7th Son.<p>Songs like Blood Brothers and Flight of the Navigator have twists and turns plus synths, \r\nthe chirf two ingredients of prog. As thrilled as proggies should be with this album, I feel it \r\nlacks some of the fun of earlier works. I believe the reason for this was that the band was \r\ntrying to make up for lost ground. This is the most serious album in their catalogue. That's \r\ncertainly not a bad thing, in fact it's pretty positive, but I miss the energy of Powerslave \r\nand the fun of NotB. Things would only get better from here with Maiden's next release \r\nDance of Death. Highly recommended to Maiden fans and even to newcomers.<p>Grade: C++</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=105079#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=105079\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=105079\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, December 31, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #105079)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n After the commercial and critical failure of VIRTUAL XI, Iron Maiden and vocalist Blaze Bayley mutually decided to part ways. The \r\nband didn't take long to announce what many fans viewed as the resurrection for The Beast: Bruce Dickinson, former front man, \r\nwould be re-taking his spot as lead singer. To add to the miracle, Adrian Smith, last seen on SEVENTH SON (Dickinson's-Maiden \r\nlast truly great album) was back again, but without any current member leaving, thus making the Irons a three-guitar outfit. The \r\ndreaded years of Bayley were over; a new, refreshed, re-vitalized Maiden was going to emerge from the ashes. That's what the \r\nfans thought. <p> And, to a degree, that's what actually happened. Sure, the old Beast was back. With Dickinson at the helm, everything was in \r\nplace together; the band could once again focus on writing their traditional metal anthems, as now they had a singer whose voice \r\ncould actually match the power of the instrumental machinery. Gone were the days when Harris had to think twice about how to \r\nbuild each song in a way that would suit their low-ranged singer the best, not to overpower it or create parts that would make it \r\nshow its deficiencies. Yes, Iron Maiden could once again conquer the skies. <p>  But, as I implied, the thing wasn't exactly a <em>resurrection</em> in qualitative terms but more of a <em>re-birth</em> for the old \r\nMaiden. Now with Dickinson holding the microphone, the band actually went <strong>back</strong> to their old sound. The music that \r\nmade Maiden famous and loved around the world was here again, but at the expense of the progressive, more melodic \r\narrangements that Bayley's weak voice forced Harris to write for the songs in the two preceding albums. Many of the \r\ninstrumental and structural discoveries that the group had made in the past were thrown aside in favor of a return to old \r\nformulas, not completely, of course, but at least partially. <p> And that's the reason why I don't see the \"resurrection\" as such. I think Iron Maiden WAS alive in the Bayley-era, as much alive \r\nas it was now, in 2000, when they released their first album since Dickinson had returned. As my previous reviews showed, I \r\nhappen to love both Bayley-fronted albums, so BRAVE NEW WORLD felt somewhat awkward for me the first time I heard it: it \r\nwas like if the band I was getting to love suddenly disappeared and the <strong>other</strong> band I used to adore had came back \r\nfrom the dead. All of a sudden, it was like if from FEAR OF THE DARK Iron Maiden would had jumped forward straight to this album, \r\nbypassing that 1995-1999 era. <p> Of course, make no mistake: this album is great, leaps ahead of their last decent record with Dickinson and miles ahead of the one \r\nbefore that (NO PRAYER.). The music here is in traditional Maiden style but with more progressive arrangements, more \r\ninstrumental parts, but nowhere as many as in X-FACTOR or even VIRTUAL XI. Individually, there are a few things to notice. \r\nFirst, Harris truly is back at the top of his game, playing as good as ever; Nicko McBrain continues to get better, now even adding \r\ndouble bass drum (?!?) to his arsenal. The guitars, well, now we have <strong>three</strong> guitarists, each one better than the other, \r\nso the album is a solo-fest and a delight for guitar lovers. And Dickinson. I have to say it: I think he has been getting better with the \r\nyears; age hasn't taken a toll on him. His voice is a powerhouse that's a pleasure to enjoy. <p> The Wicker Man (10/10) Even if I said that some elements that were typical of the Bayley-era were lost in this album, nothing \r\ncan ever top the \"Dickinson-Maiden\" for fast, lightning-fast tracks, and this is probably their best one of all time (not \r\ncounting \"Wasted Years\" which is in a slower tempo). A guitar announces the main riff by itself, then the whole machine attacks. \r\nDickinson enters the scene as the powerful star who knows the stage was set for him. After a great pre-chorus, the chorus is \r\nsuperb, with a guitar singing a little innocent melody while McBrain (for the first time ever) uses double bass drum to accentuate \r\nthe glory of the music. Listening to this track I can understand why many fans saw this as the ultimate in resurrections, as it's \r\nmagnificent. The solos by the THREE guitarists are fantastic, as is their playing throughout the whole track. As always, an \r\nexcellent opener, maybe their best ever only after \"Sign of the Cross\" in THE X-FACTOR. <p> Ghost of the Navigator (10/10) The album starts really wonderfully. A great lamentation by a guitar opens this track, much in the \r\nvein of the first album of the Bayley-era. Then a crescendo, the intensity grows, and then the main verse, a riff not typical of \r\nMaiden. Powerful, imposing, the second section is more melodic, sounding a little like Queensryche but with Maiden written all \r\nover it; then a third section in the same tempo but different drumming; then a fourth section, in high speed, Dickinson singing \r\nover a playful ride cymbal and a crying guitar. After a repetition, the solo goes through all the speeds, the last one even \r\nenhanced by an accurate double-bass drumming by Nicko. A fantastic song, another check-mark for the resurrection list. <p> Brave New World (9.5/10) A pensive dialogue between guitars opens this song. Very melancholic, Dickinson's great singing helps \r\nto set the mood. The music gets more powerful and metallic, with a rhythm that speaks of battle, of struggle, of hope of victory. \r\nThe chorus is very good, specially as contrast to the previous desperate rhythm. The second time that the verse appears, it \r\nwould do so in faster speed, but with the same guitars singing in the background. The solo is a great axe-battle for supremacy, \r\nwith all three contestants coming out as victorious. An excellent Maiden-riff serves as bridge for the last arrival of the chorus. It \r\nseems that, after all, this album is really the phoenix bird that Eddie climbed upon to raise above the ashes. <p> Blood Brothers (9/10) A good beginning, a conversation between all the electric-string instruments. Against a triple rhythm, \r\nDickinson sings a very tuneful melody. After such an unusual prairie-ready moment, the chorus strikes as stormy, as a wake-up \r\ncall. The tempo doesn't change even in the instrumental section, which features some great melodies and it's the best part of the \r\nsong, with extensive use of the synth. Another success. Only the not-changing rhythm makes me give it \"just\" a 9. <p> The Mercenary (8.5/10) An energetic attack in the form of a riff, a fast track. The second section is very much like the chorus, \r\nwhich sounds like old Maiden, with great guitars beneath the surface. A very good speed-solo by the guitars open the way for \r\nthe third appearance of the chorus, and the end of this great, if not brilliant, fast song. <p> Dream of Mirrors (9/10) A weird operatic opening with Dickinson singing over alike guitars. Then a guitar-solo section that seems \r\nto come from an Italian western; the mood changes when Dickinson comes back to one of suspense, of tension being built, of \r\nanger being saved for later, of water ready to break the levees. Then a short melodic chorus and it starts all over again. Until \r\nnow McBrain has limited himself to use the hi-hat, now he finally jumps into the scene in full power to provide rhythm for a very \r\nQueensryche-like chorus (which is logical as Queensryche was, after all, a band prominently influenced by Iron Maiden). The very \r\nheroic but slow atmosphere changes when all of a sudden the tempo changes and we're in the middle of a throttling cavalry. \r\nGreat solos fly like bayonets, the drums pound like horse's legs, and the vocals soar like the battle chants of the warriors. The \r\nchorus appears again, and then the song ends. Great song.  <p> The Fallen Angel (8/10) The beginning of this song sounds like old, <strong>ancient</strong> Maiden, straight from the time of \r\nPOWERSLAVE. The chorus sounds just the same, bringing memories of by-gone eras. This enjoyable little track is an exercise in \r\ntime-traveling, The Beast walking over known-but-forgotten territories again. Good. Nothing else. <p> The Nomad (9/10) Another track in the vein of \"The Clansman\" in VIRTUAL XI in that it talks about a warrior from a different \r\ntime. The guitars play great tunes, while the rhythm is like a zigzagging serpent. The chorus has an oriental flavor, but its third \r\nappearance is slower, more typical-Maiden. The solos are great, all in that same nomadic-desert-like style. Halfway down we \r\nsuddenly go back to the brilliant times of THE X FACTOR, with some beautiful guitar melodies over synths and bass. A good song \r\nturned into a fantastic one. Excellent. <p> Out of the Silent Planet (7.5/10) Guitars open this song. When the vocals appear, the music sounds a little like a weird Guns N' \r\nRoses (?!?). That illusion lasts very short and we enter Maiden realm again. The chorus is good, a powerful chant, even though \r\nthe verse itself is not that remarkable. When the song gets faster it also gets better. This one sounds like a <strong>GOOD</strong> \r\ntrack out of NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING (that's almost an oxymoron). It's actually a good song and even though it's the weakest \r\nof the album, it's not bad, just not AS good as all the other ones. <p> The Thin Line Between Love & Hate (8/10) The album was on its way to a perfect rating, so it's up to this track to decide, as the \r\nlast one was not really a brilliant one. This one starts powerfully, with energy, then a battle-cry of a chorus strikes like a flaming \r\nsword. What unfolds is a rather typical Maiden song, with good solos and decent melodies. When we reach the instrumental \r\nsection, we're a little tired of the music but suddenly the air gets smoother, everything gets calmer, more melodic, the guitars \r\nsing like big ladies and the drums mark the rhythm as implacable commanders. Then the music gets quieter again, the great \r\nmelodies in the guitars are joined by Dickinson who sings a just a few lines but so well that it's as if he said \"let me say the last \r\nword, I'M BACK\". And the album ends. <p> This has seldom (if ever) happened to me before: I started to write a review with one rating in mind, only to end giving the album a \r\ndifferent one (?!?). As I always hear the music while I'm writing, now I've had the chance to realize that, even though the music \r\nis not like in the Bayley-era albums and that the sound harkens back to the earlier days of the Beast, the album IS a masterpiece \r\nin the Maiden catalogue. I won't change my introductory paragraphs as what I said still applies, specially to the two following \r\nalbums (DANCE OF DEATH and A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH), but I have to acknowledge that, in this course of this 70 \r\nminutes, I found out I was wrong. The album doesn't deserve a 4. It doesn't deserve a 5, either, as there are a couple of weak \r\ntracks; but just like in THE X FACTOR, there's so much quality to be found in the rest of the disc, that the correct rating is a 4.5, \r\nwhich translates into a 5. This is my fourth favorite album by Iron Maiden, just below SOMEWHERE IN TIME, X-FACTOR and \r\nSEVENTH SON. <p> Recommended for: Iron Maiden fans, metal fans, progressive metal fans (there ARE a lot of progressive elements), and \r\nspecially, Bruce Dickinson fans.<p>.even though, for me, this is not a resurrection (as in my eyes Maiden was <strong>never dead</strong>), one thing's clear: Dickinson's \r\nregular speaking voice is much more powerful than Bayley's screaming at the top of his lungs; Dickinson is, after all, The Voice of \r\nThe Beast. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=127782#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=127782\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=127782\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 6, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #127782)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAn outstanding entry into the band's catalogue, featuring not only the return of their iconic front-man, but also some of the band's \r\nmost exciting songwriting and instrumental performances of all time.  The songs on \"Brave New World\" pulse with Maiden's distinctive \r\nrock energy, containing classic subject matter mixed with genuinely smart lyrics from Bruce and guitar work that destroys \r\nexpectations.  Moreover, the songwriting is substantially improved over most of their classic albums, excellently handling extended and ambitious tunes and filling the spaces between with memorable material.  There are enough moods, themes and power here to more than entertain longtime fans, and probably attract those \r\ninterested in what is easily one of the coolest classic metal bands around.  <p>Songwriting 4\r\nInstrumental Performances 4\r\nLyrics/Vocals 4\r\nStyle/Emotion/Replay 5</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=132091#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=132091\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=132091\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, August 6, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #132091)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1699\"><strong>sean</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1699\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1699/icecream.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis was my introduction to the modern Iron Maiden sound where they began to become a prog metal band. This album hearkens\r\nback to 1987's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and I think it is their best effort since then. Bruce Dickinson came back for\r\nthis album and now they also had 3 guitarists, quite a unique set up. The interplay between the three is great, and it never\r\nbecomes to muddy and confusing. The album kicks off with \"The Wicker Man\", a memorable rocking song with the uplifting chorus\r\n\"your time will come\". The great thing about this album is how Iron Maiden combines high energy metal with complex non-linear\r\nsong structures, and also makes it memorable and catchy. Maiden is also well known for coming up with some of the best guitar\r\nriffs ever, and they don't disappoint on this album. Songs like Brave New World, Blood Brothers, Dream of Mirrors, The Nomad,\r\nand the oft-overlooked The Thin Line Between Love and Hate are all perfect examples of the aforementioned traits of Maiden. I\r\nhighly recommend this album to any metal fan, and the more adventurous prog fans who don't mind heavy music. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=140099#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=140099\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=140099\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, September 23, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #140099)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter a break and two Maiden albums without him, Bruce Dickinson is back on business with the band seven years after having \r\nleft.<p>And I would say that this \"Brave New World\" is of another calibre than \"The X Factor\" and \"Virtual XI\" even if I didn't dislike these \r\ntwo. But this one is better.<p>\"The Wicker Man\" is a killer opening number like in the good old days. Fantastic metal beat as they should have always played. \r\nThis album is nothing else than a juxtaposition of great and wild songs as any fan was expecting (at least during the first part of \r\nthis album). And there is little deception here. Some very good fireworks for metal lovers of which \"Ghost Of The Navigator\" is \r\none of the most sparkling part.<p>The title track is a dual song : tranquil and slow during the intro and the finale, it features a typical Maiden middle part. An \r\nexplosion of guitars (no wonder with three guitar players) and powerful riff. A brave Maiden song. Another highlight.<p>Most of the songs are on the long side (only three are shorter than six minutes). This leaves time to develop them and create \r\nmore complex and diversified ones. \"Blood Brothers\" definitely belongs to this category while \"The Mercenary\" is more on the pop \r\nmetal genre (?). Catchy vocals and great rhythm guitars. A very good song after all.<p>The structure of \"Dream Of Mirrors\" is very much similar to \"Dream Of Mirrors\". A mix of quiet passages mixed with truly heavy \r\nmetal ones. Not my fave I have to say, but still a solid piece of metal. Unlike the heaviest one of this album : \"The Fallen Angel\" is \r\na rather dull number (but it is only the first one so far.).<p>Quite normal for \"The Nomad\" to show some Oriental roots during the intro. Great off-beat drumming but I start to like it very \r\nmuch after the break around minute five or so. It turns into a beautiful and melodic tune for a while which leaves the place to a \r\ngreat instrumental and crescendo finale. The type of closing which I always appreciate. The Maiden is back in the good territories.<p>But the band is playing like a roller coaster. Not mentioning the rhythm but the ups and downs in terms of quality of the songs \r\nbecause \"Out Of The Silent Planet\" is way too long, repetitive and boring. But fortunately, the closing \"The Thin Line Between \r\nLove & Hate\" brings us back in the ups again. Pleasant vocals, nice rhythm and mood changes and a very good guitar solo to \r\nfinish on a high note again.<p>This album weakens after \"The Mercenary\" but remains one of the very good Maiden album. <p>Four stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155369#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155369\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=155369\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 13, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #155369)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWith the return of lead-singer and front-man Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith Maiden had this amazing momentum. Both were also good song-writers that made important contributions to the Maiden discography. Everything feels right, good songs, fresh sound, lot's of good guitar parts, great vocals and some nice new experiments along the way. Even the artwork is great! The vinyl version of the album is a real treat.<p>The Wickerman is an energetic opener with nice guitarsolo's, but the real fun begins with Ghost of the Navigator with it's story-telling lyrics and great guitar sound. The atmosphere of the track is distinctive. Brave New World, the title track, has it all. Great emotional parts and honest vocals, great instrumental parts and a memorable guitar-solo. Great! Blood Brothers shows some 'coming to age' influences and is a very very mature song. The middle section has a great melody and amazing lyrics. The Mercenary is nice up-tempo metal-track, but it could have been shorter IMHO. Dream of Mirrors has a progressive, intellectual form and atmospheric use of an acoustic guitar in the quiet section during the refrains. The songs has a lot of lyrics, but they are really good. The Fallen Angel is a song-type like the Mercenary. Short, catchy and some nice melodies. The Nomad is another very progressive type song with the heaviest Maiden sound ever. The heavy riff and the eastern-like distorted solo is really good. The tension building in the middle section is also great. Out of the Silent Planet is another catchy song, it could have been a bit shorter. The Thin Line Between Love & Hate has again good lyrics and a sound as if Maiden had come to piece. A good ending track for the album, but it took me some time to learn to appreciate it. <p>Conclusion. This is Iron Maiden most mature album. It shows true skill, a great collaboration by a six-man band and the best of metal compositions. Some tracks like Blood Brothers, Brave New World and Dream of Mirrors stand out as very good epical songs. A great offering, essential for the metal-scene and very interesting for most proggers because of it's melodic and lyrical approach. Four stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162021#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162021\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=162021\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, February 17, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #162021)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3717\"><strong>Raff</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=3717\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/3717/200px-Fire_Of_Unknown_origin.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBruce Dickinson's comeback album ranks among Iron Maiden's best efforts ever, and is probably their\r\nmost progressive - even more so than the celebrated \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". While it is not\r\na concept album, it does feature numerous progressive elements, which mingle with the underlying\r\nmetal structure of the compositions to create a very intriguing, complex sound. Those who still\r\nthink Maiden are nothing but purveyors of mindless bludgeoning would do better to listen to the\r\nband's whole output with an open mind - they might be surprised. Though they might not be considered\r\nas fully prog, their relation to our beloved genre is nowhere more evident than on this album. <p>\r\n\"Brave New World\" boasts at least four songs of almost epic length, with frequent time signature\r\nshifts, complex arrangements, keyboards galore, and a monstrous, three-pronged guitar attack which\r\nprovides melodic texture as well as aggression. However, the real stars here are Bruce's commanding\r\nvocals, richer and more expressive, matured by years of experience beyond his former screamer\r\npersona; and Steve Harris's powerful yet fluid bass, whose, deep rumbling sound has become the\r\nband's trademark over the years. Kevin Shirley's excellent, crisp production pushes both features to\r\nthe fore, though without overwhelming the other elements in the band's music. <P>\r\nIn particular, the role of the three guitarists is the polar opposite of the trite guitar hero\r\nantics that many have come to associate with heavy metal. Smith, Murray and Gers have different\r\nstyles that nevertheless complement each other, their solos forming an essential part of the songs,\r\nand never feeling like sterile exercises in one-upmanship. In my opinion, Smith's return to the\r\nfold, even more than Dickinson's, is what really makes the difference on this album. Adrian is\r\nindeed a technically excellent guitarist, with a fluid, melodic style, and his contribution to the\r\nband's songwriting has always been essential - even if his erstwhile replacement Janick Gers often\r\ngives him a run for his money in the compositional stakes. <p>\r\nAs a matter of fact, Gers is responsible (together with the omnipresent Harris) for what I consider\r\nto be the album's highpoint, the 9-minute-plus \"Dream of Mirrors\", an epic tour de force chock-full\r\nof time signature changes, galloping bass lines, dynamic riffing and sweeping keyboards, masterfully\r\nconducted by Dickinson's consummate vocal skill. \"The Nomad\" is another interesting song, rich in\r\nMiddle-Eastern influences and spiced up by the presence of synthesisers - as is the melodic,\r\noccasionally ballady \"Blood Brothers\". On the other hand, album closer \"The Thin Line Between Love\r\nand Hate\", all too often overlooked in favour of other tracks, s a lively, variegated song which\r\ncombines a hard edge with a beautiful, atmospheric close, dominated by Dickinson's unusually\r\nsensitive vocals. <p>\r\nFans of Maiden's more metallic side will find a lot to appreciate in the double punch of opener \"The\r\nWicker Man,\" and its follow-up, \"Ghost of the Navigator\", which feature fast and furious riffing\r\nalongside more than a touch of melody,  the catchy, energetic \"The Mercenary\", or the anthemic\r\ntitle-track. What all those songs have in common, though, is that none of them is a 'simple',\r\nstandard heavy metal song. Iron Maiden have grown and matured in the course of their long career,\r\nand their never-disguised interest in progressive rock now shows as a clear influence on their\r\nsongwriting. <p>\r\nWhile obviously not a masterpiece of progressive music in the strict sense of the word, \"Brave New\r\nWorld\" is nevertheless more than worthy of attention from all those prog fans who can look beyond\r\nlabels and stereotypes. Almost thirty years after their inception, Iron Maiden are still at the top\r\nof their game, and they have been capable of evolving and progressing beyond their rough'n'ready,\r\npunk-metal roots. Approach with an open mind, and enjoy. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162034#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162034\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=162034\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, February 17, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #162034)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nNot since \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\" have IRON MAIDEN sounded so good. It's not surprising that \r\nthe return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith coincide with them putting out such a stunning album. In \r\nsome ways it seems like this record is a continuation of the sound from \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh \r\nSon\". And as Ghost Rider explains, this one might be even more progressive than that 1988 release. I \r\nhave to mention the album cover as probably being my favourite MAIDEN cover ever. The main evil \r\nface in the sky with other creepy faces around it looking down on the futuristic city is fascinating to say \r\nthe least. What does make this different from \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\" is that this album really \r\ncomes off as being like a greatest hits record with one amazing song after another, and they are all \r\nvery different from one another as well. Whereas \"Seventh Son...\" is a concept album with the songs \r\nbeing all connected somewhat. Some have mentioned the fact that there are 3 lead guitarists on this \r\nrecord, but keep in mind that all 3 also play rhythm guitar, it's not like 3 guys are soloing at the same \r\ntime or standing there waiting for their turn to play when the other is done.<p>\r\n\"The Wicker Man\" opens with heavy riffs as vocals come in. Harris is incredible on bass.The instrumental \r\nsection 2 1/2 minutes in is a highlight followed by some blistering guitar. Bruce does his famous vocal \r\nmelodies 4 minutes in to the end of the song. \"Ghost Of The Navigator\" is even better in my opinion, \r\nespecially the lyrics and the relentless rhythm. The beautifully tasteful guitar intro is run right over by \r\nthe heavy riffs that follow. The vocals and sound 1 1/2 minutes in are beyond words.Themes are \r\nrepeated. Ripping guitar after 4 1/2 minutes and check out Nicko on drums a minute later. \"Brave New \r\nWorld\" is my favourite track. I just love the contrast of the gorgeous mellow sections to the hell bent for \r\nleather passages.The intro is simply wondrous. Reserved vocals come in with beautiful lyrics. All hell \r\nbreaks loose 1 1/2 minutes in as Nicko pounds it out and Bruce's voice rises in power. Chunky bass is \r\nso upfront during the chorus. A guitar solo 4 minutes in goes on and on,my God !  Another leads guitarist \r\ntakes the baton and runs with it. The song ends just as it began.<p> \"Blood Brothers\" is the only song \r\ncomposed by Steve Harris all by himself. He does take part in writing on every song on this album but \r\ngets help from various band members. The rhythm to open is almost waltz-like.This song has some \r\norchestration that comes and goes. Fat bass lines from Harris. A calm 4 minutes in that continues as we \r\nget some fantastic soaring guitar after 5 1/2 minutes. The chorus then follows as Bruce shouts \"We're \r\nblood brothers\" over and over. Hell ya ! \"The Mercenary\"  is one of my top 3 favourites.This one is \r\nfurious with classic MAIDEN lyrics. Such a full and powerful sound that is drum led. Vocals are \r\naggressive. \"Show them no fear show them no pain\". Absolutely blistering guitar 3 minutes in followed \r\nby a second ripping solo. Nice. Nicko is relentless with the pounding drums. \"Dream Of Mirrors\" is such a \r\nride. The intro is probably my least favourite part of the album but the rest of the song is \r\noutstanding. The tempo shifts are especially incredible to listen to. The song is fairly reserved until they \r\nstart to power up 3 minutes in on the chorus. It becomes restrained again until before 6 minutes when it \r\nseems to get faster and faster,and check out the vocal melody after 7 minutes followed by some \r\nscorching guitar. It slows back down after 8 minutes. \"The Fallen Angel\" is so heavy with the \r\nground-shaking bass and drums. Bruce sings passionately in this powerful tune. Check out the guitar \r\nsolos 3 minutes in.<p> \"The Nomad\" is my other top 3 track. I love the classic MAIDEN lyrics and the beat is \r\nthe best on the album as the guitar plays over top. Mind-numbing stuff. Vocals after a minute. 2 1/2 \r\nminutes in he sings Nomad and holds the note like the good old days. Priceless.The guitar to follow is \r\njust outlandish. It's so good. A calm 4 1/2 minutes in is very cool. Some orchestration comes in as the \r\nsong becomes full again. Wondrous guitar to end it. Great, great tune. \"Out Of The Silent Planet\" opens \r\nwith guitar that is replaced by reserved vocals. The song kicks in after a minute. Harris is all over this \r\none. Check out the lyrics \"The punishment is death for all who live\".The tempo really shifts on this song \r\nas well. The instrumental section 4 minutes in is a highlight,and then they start that galloping rhythm \r\nthey're famous for. \"The Thin Line Between Love & Hate\" has this great heavy intro that starts to pick \r\nup speed as vocals come in. We find out why Bruce is called the human siren 2 minutes in and 3 1/2 \r\nminutes in. Inspired ripping guitar follows. A calm 5 1/2 minutes in is so beautiful as guitar is played \r\nmournfully followed by sad vocals. It starts to pick back up as a guitar solo rises up from the \r\ncalm. Another calm ends the song and the album.<p>\r\nThis hopefully is a brave new era for the band where everything old is new again. All i know is that this \r\nalbum is one of my top 5 MAIDEN records, and that's saying something.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=164122#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=164122\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=164122\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, March 17, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #164122)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17488\"><strong>Petrovsk Mizinski</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17488\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17488/Sex.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFrom the time that Adrian Smith left the band, until he came back, I felt all the studio albums after \r\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son were far from impressive. Iron Maiden, Powerslave, Somewhere In \r\nTime and Seventh Son were all albums that represented the sheer genius of Iron Maiden to me, with \r\nPiece Of Mind and Killers not being too bad either. \r\nAfter the Blaze Bayley, a vocalist that was not a particular favorite of mine, left the band Adrian and \r\nBruce would make a welcome return to the band, and a thunderous miracle that would prove for the \r\nband.\r\nThe band would come to have 3 guitarists now, as well as Harris, Dickinson, and McBrain and a \r\nfantastic line up this was for Brave New World.\r\nThis album to me, not only revived much of the classic Iron Maiden sound, but somehow among all the \r\nclassic flavor of the sound it still had a comtemporary edge to it, which would only be a good thing to \r\nme and enhanced the listening experience even more.<p>The album doesn't start on a particularly strong note, but by no means is <strong>The Wickerman</strong> a \r\nbad song. It has a very classic fast paced Maiden vibe, and a superb emotional guitar solo from Smith. \r\nWhile none of the song are what we could really call progressive, I think that many of the songs on \r\nhere are the most progressive effort yet by Maiden. \r\nThe <strong>Ghost Of The Navigator</strong> and <strong>Brave New World</strong> give some similar feelings and \r\nthoughts as I listen, so I'll talk about them together. The Ghost of The Navigator is less straight forward \r\nin stucture than either Brave New World and The Wicker Man, but some of the melodies in Ghost of The \r\nNavigator  and BNW have similar feelings to them and I just think there couldn't have been a better \r\nsong other than BNW to be next after Ghost of The Navigator  on the track. Both again have great \r\nguitar solos, but I favor the ones on BNW slightly more, although Ghost of The Navigator  is a slightly \r\nbetter song due to the more creative lyrics and less use of lyrical repetition during the chorus that BNW \r\nhas.\r\nMy favorite on this album is surely <strong> Blood Brothers</strong>. Despite the chorus having repetitive lyrics, \r\nthey seem to work well. The lush orchestral sounding arrangment of both the guitars and keyboards \r\nduring the chorus positively just floor me. After the guitar solo, there is another insanely beautiful \r\nmoment between the guitars and keyboards, and I love to just put this part on repeat and let it lift me \r\nabove the ground. Just an absolutely perfect song and the unquestionable masterpiece of the album for \r\nme and very nice to see some relatively simple yet awesomely effective keyboards from Steve Harris.\r\nAfter Blood Brothers, <strong>The Mercenary</strong> just comes off as a bit disappointing, a good song at best \r\nbut certainly not great. The only real highlight is the solo, and at the end of each of the two solos there \r\nis always a bent note with wide vibrato, and it sounds so effective and furious in this context.\r\nFortunately the album picks up again with <strong>Dream Of Mirrors</strong>, which starts off fairly slow and \r\neven a little quiet and just before the 6 minute mark it picks up a lot of pace, and it was a great move \r\nto my mind. This song also has one of my favorite vocal performances from Bruce too. Although fairly \r\nstraight forward, it's just a great and well written song that never fails to interest in it's nearly 9 and a \r\nhalf minute running time.\r\nBack to another more straight forward rocker with <strong>The Fallen Angel</strong>, which is nothing \r\nremarkable, but the instrumental/guitar solo section does capture my interest everytime, and Bruce \r\nsounds great in the chorus.\r\nUsing the Phyrgian scale, <strong>The Nomad</strong> captures an Oriental feeling and this song has one of the \r\nbest instrumental sections on the album. Great performances all round from the band.\r\nWhile being another of the less complex songs on here, <strong>Out Of The Silent Planet</strong> has some \r\nawesome melodies and the choruses towards the later part of the song are just so catchy and melodic I \r\nalmost want to sing along, the only thing stopping me is knowing I couldn't do it without butchering \r\nBruce's vocals.\r\nA heavier start for the album closer <strong>The Thing Line Between Love and Hate</strong>, which has \r\neverything from catchy verses and choruses to fantastic guitar solos, some nice bass lines from Steve \r\nHarris and a very nice instrumental section. Definitely a good album closer.<p>This is an absolutely top notch effort from Iron Maiden, and for those who are looking for something \r\nafter the disappointing run of albums from 1990 onwards, can do a lot worse than to check out this \r\nfabulous return to amazing form by Maiden. If there is one complaint, it's that Steve's bass doesn't \r\nalways stick out as much as some of the other albums, but that is a very minor complaint for this \r\nexcellent album. One of my favorite Maiden albums and it has many progressive elements and I \r\nimagine this can appeal to a lot of people and not just metal fans.<p><p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=169831#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=169831\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=169831\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, May 4, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #169831)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9836\"><strong>tszirmay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9836\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/9836/Roxy.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBoy! Some of you are going to be really surprised, a Roxy/ Symph Prog  fan reviewing Iron \r\nMaiden, \"wow, we never thought you had it in you,  T\" . Well, the jokes on you, pals! Prog has turned \r\nme into a no-boundaries kind of music fan and this is my first Maiden album and review. Actually, I \r\nremember how it happened, I saw a TV show with Maiden live in Rio and I was sort of spellbound by \r\nthe rather obvious instrumental talents of Steve Harris, Nico McBrain and Jannick \r\nGers.  \"Brave New World\" has your stereo-typical gloom and doom artwork, a futuristic London (yeah, \r\nthe Bridge still hasn't fallen down) with the river Thames dividing a choking megapolis of surreal missile-\r\nlike scrapers whilst the \"beast\" winks from the cloudy thunderclouds. \"The Wicker Man\" blasts forward \r\nfeaturing a rather classic triple (yes, 3 axemen!) riffing guitar attack, bruising drumming and dizzying \r\nbass propulsion. Nuclear-lunged Bruce Dickinson is really quite impressive, howling out anthem-like \r\nchoruses (\"Your Time Will Come\"), not very proggy but quite enjoyable while driving down the concrete \r\nhighway at full speed. \"Ghost of the Navigator\" is, on the other hand, what makes proggers stand up \r\nand pump fist and the first of numerous epics on this spellbinding disc. The near 7 minutes veer into \r\nrapid -fire movements that swerve controllably, speeding up and slowing down, twisting on a dime, the \r\nchorus is bombastically evoked, guitars buzzing, McBrain pummeling mercilessly. A hysterical guitar \r\nsolo ensues (don't ask me who, I have no clue! < Nice rhyme, wot?) that blitzes furiously and then the \r\nwindswept chorus is revisited .   The title cut launches gently, almost minimalist with twanging guitars \r\nand a sober Dickinson reading, with a sudden upturn in the thrust, defining the theme even more until \r\nthe massive chorus kicks in. It's obvious to this rookie fan that Iron Maiden really knows how to erect \r\n(sic!) multiple choral melodies and weave them into an instrumental package that certainly goes \r\nbeyond your usual metal arrangement. This song is a perfect example, as the wild solo (Don't ask me \r\nwho.) only highlights the power and the passion so inexorably expressed by the exemplary vocals. \r\nThe magnificent \"Blood Brothers\" offers a fully orchestrated violin-laden intro, tossing in some suitably \r\nsweeping keyboard squalls played by Mister Harris, clearly defining the progressive element that \r\nmagnifies this band's creative craft. The insistent story-telling chorus pushes hard, the guitars churn \r\nappropriately, with a short simmering solo (Don't ask me who.) and a colossal anthemic mid-section \r\nwith more well-placed orchestrations. A Celtic-tinged dual guitar theme is lovingly expressed, with \r\nanother solo creeping out with unashamed vigor and ceremony.  Errr. I love this stuff!  \"The \r\nMercenary\" is a not the kindest subject matter, and the beastly pile driving rhythm is there to reinforce \r\nthe rage and the nihilism (\"No where to run, nowhere to hide, you got to kill to stay alive\") , while \r\nentertaining, is too mundane for my tastes. \"Dream of Mirrors\" is another whopping epic, clocking in at \r\nover 9 minutes, hissing at first like an angry missile before metamorphosing into a stunning Spanish \r\nguitar motif with anxious vocals from Monsieur Dickinson, all restrained emotion waiting to explode into \r\na maelstrom of sonic grandeur, with another gigantic refrain, passionately \"colorful\" lyrics (\"I only \r\ndream in Black and White\") and a hasty mid-section that pushes and pushes hard, faster and faster. \r\nAnother warp-speed guitar solo (Don't ask me.) adds the obligatory six-string electric fury to the \r\nflurry. \"The Fallen Angel\" is a 4 minute romp, insistent bass leading the way, a demonic rant that is \r\nmore classic metal than anything, thus giving Dickinson the opportunity to rant loud and \r\napocalyptically. A wah-drenched solo adds some ass to it all. Cute, even amusing but a tad \r\npuerile \"pour moi\"! The 9 minute \"The Nomad\" props up a tent of Saharan guitar patterns that rekindle \r\npleasant thoughts of Zep's \"Kashmir\" before Dickinson howls like the arid wind of a sandstorm, grainy, \r\nunrelenting and massive. The screeching guitar whirlwinds brilliantly evoke the isolation of desert \r\nperdition (the quiet mid-section is a reprieve, no \"Camel\" in sight or is it just a mirage?).The guitar \r\ncrunch returns, fusing with an adamant North African flavored theme, the orchestrations adding even \r\nmore bombast and mystic aura, proving again that these heavy lads can refine deliciously when \r\nprompted. The finale is expertly heavy and desperate, with Dickinson in fine form, while all the axe \r\nsolos are impressive (Don't ask..). \"Out of the Silent Planet\" is at first an odd sonic detour that quickly \r\nexplodes into a reveling instrumental mania that will please the harder-edged fans but again leaves me \r\nunchallenged. The final cut (sorry Roger) is the brooding pile driver \"The Thin Line Between Love & \r\nHate\", an 8 and a half epic that chugs along mercilessly, with a classic lyrical depiction of one of life's \r\nobvious tests, a hopping chorus that somehow is not as convincing as the previous whoppers, even \r\nthough the vocals are heavenly powerful (what lungs!). A series of zipping axe solos (Don't.) put this \r\nwild affair to bed. This Brave New World is quite an achievement and seemingly very much admired by \r\nthe legion of Maiden fans. I started here and I am glad I did, as every \"gentle\" man needs a little metal \r\nfury in his prog collection and I would definitely recommend this to equally hesitant soft proggers. \r\nThis is dedicated to my colleague and friend sinkadotentee who piqued my curiosity and paddled me to \r\npurchase this . I hope it blows your mind! 4.5 valiant, innovative planets\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=202735#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=202735\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=202735\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, February 14, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #202735)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Brave new maiden!</strong><p>I remember hearing The Wicker Man on the radio around the time of the release of this album. I instantly liked it and rushed out to buy the album. In those days I was not too familiar with Iron Maiden even if I had heard some of their most popular 80's songs as well as the Fear Of The Dark album which I had listened to a lot some years previously. But by this time I had not listened to anything by Iron Maiden for several years. I also remember a talk show appearance by Bruce Dickinson on Swedish national television, where the interviewer commented on the metal singer now having short hair, and of course, on the reunion of Dickinson and the rest of the band. I also remember him saying on this show that the new album (this was before it's release) might not have an Eddie on the cover. It was clear that they had something special coming out.<p>I certainly wouldn't call myself an Iron Maiden fan - not then, and not now - and also not really a metal fan in general, but this album holds a very special place in my collection. I was impressed with this album when I first heard it and I still am today! Since then I have heard the band's entire discography and I still think that Brave New World is one of the very best Iron Maiden albums of all time. Indeed, only Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son - to which it bears a significant resemblance - is better. These two albums clearly are the two most progressive albums by this band.<p>The progressiveness of Brave New World is strongly apparent in the arrangements and in the many interesting tempo changes and mood changes within the same song. Like on Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son there are discrete keyboards in the background on several songs that adds a greater depth to the music. The Prog fan probably notices immediately that most of the songs are over six minutes in length and three songs are over eight minutes. Song length is never a guarantee for progressive music, but here is can be taken as a strong hint as to the nature of the album.<p>By this time Iron Maiden became a larger band with as many as three guitarists! This is very interesting and they utilize it to the maximum - there are loads of great guitar solos. There are no ballads as such here, but there are many quieter sections and ballady moments within these songs, making for a diverse and very dynamic set. This is especially true of the excellent The Thin Line Between Love And Hate - which I love and not hate at all!<p>Brave New World is that kind of album that while playing it appears as if every new song is better than the previous one. There is just one great melody after another. It is hard to pick out favourites, since while listening to it every song is greater than the others. The music of Brave New World is highly melodic with very strong and memorable melodies and riffs. Indeed, the title track and Blood Brothers might have the most melodic choruses the band had ever made, which might turn some people off perhaps. In my view, however, there is not one weak song on this album. It would be useless to list my favourite tracks because I would end up listing most, or even all of them. But I would like to give special mention to the far eastern-flavoured The Nomad - brilliant song! Generally, I would say that the second half of the album is stronger than the first half.<p>This is simply an excellent addition to any Prog collection!\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=218417#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=218417\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=218417\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, May 26, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #218417)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAt first sight, there's nothing really wrong here and instrumentally it sound almost as great as\r\never before.

After two very disappointing albums in <em>The X-Factor (1995)</em> and <em>Virtual \r\nXI (1998)</em> ( the latter didn\u00b4t reach the million copies sold mark which was the first time in \r\nthe band\u00b4s history) with lead singer <B>Blaze Bayley</B> manning the microphone. In \r\nFebruary 1999, <B>Blaze Bayley</B> left the band by mutual consent and <B>Iron Maiden</B> \r\nannounced the return of lead vocalist <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> and maybe even more \r\nsurprisingly guitarist <B>Adrian Smith</B>. As there where no further departures from <B>Iron \r\nMaiden</B> they now had three guitarists in the lineup. <B>Iron Maiden</B> embarked on a \r\nhugely successful re-union tour called <em>The Ed Hunter Tour</em> before going into the studio \r\nto record <em>Brave New World</em>. The album is hailed by many critics as a triumphant return \r\nto form.<p>After <B>Blaze Bayley\u00b4s</B> weak vocal contributions to the two previous <B>Iron Maiden</B> \r\nalbums it\u00b4s such a treat to hear <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> sing on an <B>Iron Maiden</B> \r\nalbum again. The music on <em>Brave New World</em> hasn\u00b4t changed much from those two \r\nalbums though and IMO it\u00b4s actually one of the weaker efforts by the band. The next two \r\nalbums <em>Dance of Death (2003)</em> and <em>A Matter of Life and Death (2003)</em> are much \r\nmore exciting and well executed IMO. There are a few songs that stand out as being above \r\naverage on the album and that\u00b4s <em>Ghost of the Navigator</em> and the epic <em>The \r\nNomad</em>. The rest are not bad. The songs are just pretty average run of the mill <B>Iron \r\nMaiden</B> songs. I\u00b4m generally not too impressed with the quality of the songwriting on the \r\nalbum though. What saves the album is as always the impeccable and enthusiastic \r\nmusicianship. The production is a bit flat and it doesn\u00b4t help on my already negative impression of the album.<p>While I wildy applauded the return of <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> to <B>Iron Maiden\u00b4s</B> lineup \r\nback then I have never been too impressed by <em>Brave New World</em>. Not back then and not \r\nnow. A 2.5 - 3 star rating is deserved. I\u00b4ll recommend their next two releases anyday over this \r\none.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=239196#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=239196\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=239196\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 14, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #239196)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17216\"><strong>Sinusoid</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nLike most Maiden fans, I was first exposed to the band through their ''hits'' ''Run to the Hills'' \r\nand ''Number of the Beast''.  But as for the first album in whole that I listened to, logically I \r\nstarted with...BRAVE NEW WORLD.  Surprised?  Me too, considering how well these songs \r\nare played.<p>I'm glad Iron Maiden can still rock out as many of the shorter songs like ''The Wicker Man'' \r\nand ''The Fallen Angel'' can attest to.  There are a few longer tracks that veer in the prog \r\ndirection; all I can say is that they're decent prog compositions at best, but they run too long for \r\nme and suffer from hokey concepts.  ''The Nomad'' is the best of these outfits IMO.  There are \r\neven a few songs here like the title track and ''Ghost of the Navigator'' that don't do anything for \r\nme at all.<p>Bottom line: this is very good hard rock with only a few hints of prog rock.

All killer, no filler, the album is a tour de force of progressive \r\ninstrumentation and conceptual lyrics. Smith returns with Murray who are joined by Gers \r\nand the triple guitar work is masterful, featuring synth guitars as well as traditional speed \r\npicking and high energy string bends. The band are highly motivated on this album and it \r\nspawned the Live In Rio DVD where I first heard a lot of this album. I was inspired by the \r\nDVD to get hold of this album as it is such a fantastic bunch of songs. I was taken with the \r\nmasterpiece \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" but this album is even better; an absolute \r\nbrilliant metal powerhouse. <p>\r\n'The Wicker Man' is the first track with a killer riff and a fast tempo. Dickinson's vocals are \r\nmulti layered with harmonies. The lyrics are fast and tell a story, \"You watch the world \r\nexploding every single night, Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light, Brothers and their \r\nfathers joining hands and make a chain, The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again, \r\nYour time will come, Your time will come...\" The lead break is replete with very fast hammer \r\nons and pull offs and high pitch notes. It ends with a \"woah\" section that I can imagine \r\nevery member of the audience chanting along to with fists pounding the air. A great way to \r\nbegin the album.<p>\r\n'Ghost of the Navigator', my favourite song on the album, stamps it's authority with a \r\nfantastic melody that locks in immediately with clean guitars. The distortion kicks in soon \r\nand then a chugging riff drives it along to Dickinson's enigmatic vocals, \"I see the ghosts of \r\nnavigators but they are lost, As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost, As their \r\nskeletons accusing emerge from the sea, The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me.\" The \r\ntime sigs change several times before we get to the familiar tune that once in your head will \r\nnever leave, \"Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves, Nowhere left to \r\nrun, navigator's son, Chasing rainbows all my days...\" The verses continue after this with all \r\nthe time changes till we get to the lead break, and what a break! Arpeggios and sweep \r\npicking at high speed. The fret melting work of Smith and Murray with Gers are backed by \r\npounding drums of McBrain and Harris's awesome basslines. This is Maiden at their best! \r\nThe power metal on display here is simply awesome. <p>\r\n'Brave New World' is another definitive Maiden track that begins with a solid guitar line that \r\nall Maidenheads love. It sets the pace and the strong melody. The tranquillity and soft \r\nvocals are so ethereal they send shivers down the spine. The guitars chug in and \r\nDickinson's vocals move to 'Air Raid Siren' mode; \"Wilderness house of pain, makes no \r\nsense of it all, Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall, What you see is not \r\nreal, those who know will not tell, All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world, A brave \r\nnew world, in a brave new world...\" The time sig changes in the chorus and the audience \r\nwill be singing along every time, as indeed they are on the live DVD. The pace really picks \r\nup in the next adrenaline charged verse. The drum and bass rhythm machine is relentless \r\nand motorvates along till we get to the lead break. The guitars trade off duelling in \r\ntrademark style, with very fast speed picking and note for note perfect speed work up the \r\nfrets. Then the wonderful melodic harmonics of the three guitars takes it to another level; it \r\nis sheer bliss when the band are in full flight. <p>\r\n'Blood Brothers' features a lot of bass and an orchestra reminding me of Ayreon or Therion. \r\nThe strings are majestic and the vocals are more subdued. It almost sounds like a bizarre \r\nwaltz feel. I am not a huge fan of this track but it does have a nice melody and is a different \r\nbeast among all the intricate metal blasts.<p>\r\n'The Mercenary' is next  with some effective riffing and strong powerful lyrics; \"Toe to toe \r\nthrow the line, Everyone's caught hand tied, Iron will iron fist, How could it have come to \r\nthis?\" It is creative songwriting and highly influential.<p>\r\n'Dream of Mirrors' is a lengthy track with a consistent rhythm and melodic chorus; \"I only \r\ndream in black and white, I only dream 'cause I'm alive, I only dream in black and white, To \r\nsave me from myself.\" This has a sombre feel but very welcome prior to the frenetic \r\ncomplexity of subsequent tracks.<p>\r\n'The Nomad' is an excellent 9 minute mini epic with a majestic sweeping lead riff. The \r\npace quickens and slows at intervals. The chorus is catchy and easy to sing along \r\nto; \"Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious, Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us, \r\nNomad, you're the rider of the desert sands, No man's ever understood your genius.\" The \r\nrhythm is kept by distinct 11 to 12 syllable rhyming verses; \"Those who see you in horizon \r\ndesert sun, Those who fear your reputation hide or run, You send before you a mystique \r\nthat's all your own, Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone.\" The middle section is a \r\nquiet guitar passage reminding me of the middle of 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner'. The \r\nguitar is rather pretty and melancholy. The melody is one that an audience can sing to with \r\nease. There is a unique style in the melody that is foreign sounding, almost Egyptian or \r\nSpanish. The steady pace is maintained throughout, with a simplistic tune but one that is \r\nvery effective, making this a definite highlight of the album. <p>\r\n'Out of the Silent Planet' begins with a solid lead riff that repeats for a while until a quiet \r\nvocal begins over acoustic arrangements. Metal guitars enter soon and another great song \r\nis belted out.\r\n <p>'The Thin Line Between Love & Hate' runs for 8 and a half minutes at a steady pace, with \r\ntrademark chugging riffs, and multilayerd vocals. The chorus is infectious as ever; \"There's \r\na thin line between love and hate, Wider divide that you can see between good and bad, \r\nThere's a grey place between black and white, But everyone does have the right to choose \r\nthe path that he takes, I will hope, My soul will fly, So I will live forever, Heart will die My soul \r\nwill fly, And I will live forever.\" The progression repeats again and then a scorching lead \r\nbreaks in at 4:50 with high pitched sustained bends and sweep picking. The song quietens \r\nto a minimalist clean guitar and hi hat cymbal beat. The next lead break is wonderful, and \r\nDickinson has a brief but strong vocal passage. The lead returns much faster with \r\nharmonics and arpeggios over a moderate paced riff. It slows again with that soaring lead \r\nbreak. It is incredible music and one of the highlights of this album.<p>\r\nOverall \"Brave New World\" may well be the greatest thing Iron Maiden have done along \r\nwith \"Powerslave\" and \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". These three albums are the \r\npinnacle of the proggiest albums from the band, as such deserve full recognition.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289896#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289896\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=289896\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, July 11, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #289896)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAlthough the return of Bruce Dickinson to Iron Maiden is something to cherish, Brave New \r\nWorld is equally special for offering the return of Adrian Smith. Indeed, arguably it's Smith's \r\ndeparture after Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, rather than Bruce quitting after Fear of the Dark, \r\nwhich really marked the beginning of the band's mid-career slump, because whilst the Blaze \r\nBayley era is often derided it isn't as though the two Smith-less albums featuring Bruce on \r\nvocals were top-flight additions to the Maiden discography.<p>As it stands, Brave New World feels like the band picking up where they left off after Seventh \r\nSon, as though the intervening albums were just a bad dream. The expanded three-guitar \r\nlineup gives the band confidence to get back to more complex song structures and lavish, \r\nlayered arrangements which they may otherwise have struggled to reproduce live,  whilst Bruce \r\nsounds as fresh as ever. I wouldn't quite call it a classic, but I certainly like it better than \r\nSomewhere In Time, and that means it deserves to be embraced in the Maiden canon.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=958432#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=958432\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=958432\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, May 12, 2013</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #958432)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11816\"><strong>Modrigue</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11816\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11816/PA-Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Brave New Maiden?</strong><p>\"The return of Bruce Dickinson\", \"And Then They Were Six\", \"And Then They Were Three Guitarists\"... All that's fine, \r\nbut all that's for what? Much ado for nearly nothing...<p>The reintegration of IRON MAIDEN's historical frontman and guitarist Adrian Smith showed great promises for the \r\nband lovers. The entire \"golden\" line-up is back, furthermore with nineties' guitarist Jannick Gers! What else could \r\nany fan dream for? In addition, unlike the past decade, the revival of heavy metal of the 2000's were a favorable \r\ncontext of the genre! Unfortunately, even this is not sufficient to recover the inspiration vanishing since 1990. If \r\nyou're expecting a return of the grandeur of the 80's, renewal, or just something refreshing and catchy, you may be \r\nquite disappointed. To be honest, the compositions even difficultly matches the troubled and uneven MAIDEN \r\nwaters of the 90's.<p>Named after the well-known eponymous book by Aldous Huxley, \"Brave New World\" does not take many risks. Like \r\n\"Virtual XI\", the music is overall insipid and lengthy. It contains even fewer interesting tracks than its predecessor. A \r\ncontinuity, as \"The Mercenary\", \"Dream of Mirrors\" and \"The Nomad\" were initially composed for the 1998 album. A \r\nglobal impression is that IRON MAIDEN's asperities developed in 20 years are progressively disappearing: very few \r\nmemorable melodies, remarkable bridges, breathtaking soli or galloping bass. The same dish, but without flavor. By \r\nthe way, in case you're wondering about the three guitars, they are hardly audible and fail to bring something to the \r\nsongs.<p>In addition, this will be the last collaboration with historical artist Derek Riggs, and he only illustrated the top half of \r\nthe cover. Furthermore, Martin Birch, the band's producer since 1981's \"Killers\" has been replaced. There are signs \r\nthat do not lie...<p>Concerning the rare good passages, the rocking \"The Wicker Man\" clearly does the job as an MAIDEN opener with \r\nits powerful theme, but it's just an illusion. The only genuine originality here is \"Nomad\" with its mystical Middle-\r\nEastern-ish atmosphere. We haven't heard this since 1984's \"Powerslave\"! Recovered creativity? In fact, the calm \r\nbeautiful section borrows an extract from 1974's BECKETT's \"Life's Shadow\". A bit lengthy, but overall quite good. \r\n\"The Fallen Angel\" average but has its moments. The rest of the disc rather flat and boring.<p>As a fan of IRON MAIDEN's eighties' albums, from their first self-titled opus to \"Seventh Son\", and of \"The X-Factor\", \r\nI was really disappointed by what was announced as the resurrection of an iconic and influential metal institution. I \r\nfelt like if I was fooled by the product.<p>Steve Harris and co. were one of the few to entirely redefine the genre in the 80's. The 90's musical melting pots \r\nwere a difficult context for traditional metal bands, and MAIDEN didn't make exception, delivering just a few \r\ninteresting tracks inside average albums. The departure of high-pitched vocalist Bruce Dickinson was an occasion \r\nfor renewal, seized with the dark and progy \"The X-Factor\". However, this evolution divided the fan-base, so the \r\nmusicians decided to return to a secure path by going back to their original recipe, but without the inspiration and \r\nthe spiciness.<p>Since the controversial 1995 opus, it seems that the band is on auto-pilot (no pun intended), gave up their creativity \r\nand will to try something new. This had to happen, \"Brave New World\" clearly marks the turning point: IRON \r\nMAIDEN has lived and now became a pale copy of itself. For sure, same can be done for other numerous artists of \r\nall genres, but here the difference is that the music doesn't match what was proclaimed as a renaissance.<p>\"Brave New World\" is an aseptic and overrated album. Too polite, neither raging, nor really epic nor adventurous \r\ncompared to what modern progressive metal bands were proposing at the same period. A new MAIDEN yes, but \r\nnot very brave...</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1678529#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1678529\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1678529\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, January 11, 2017</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12935#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1678529)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAlbum number 12 from British metal legends.
