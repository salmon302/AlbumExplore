By the end of 1982 they had already released their debut cassette album \"Seven Stories Into Eight\". They released their first vinyl album \"Tales from A Lush Attic\" independently in 1983; this is a re-mastered re-release of that album with one bonus track added. Notable are that this album is released the same year as MARILLION's debut album \"Script For A Jester's Tear\", so we're not talking any MARILLION wannabes here, although the two albums are very similar in style. They also reminds a lot of GENESIS. IQ are outstanding musicians, they have an excellent vocalist that sometimes reminds of Peter GABRIEL and their music is very powerful with strong melodies. The highlights are the opening 20-minute epic masterpiece \"The Last Human Gateway\" and the closing \"The Enemy Smacks\". This is a highly recommended album, especially if you're into GENESIS and neo-progressive rock.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3591#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3591\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3591\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, February 21, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3591)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn 1983, the post 70's progressive rock bands was a rare reality belonging mainly to \r\nMARILLION and TWELFTH NIGHT. IQ started in 1983 with this album. Instantly, they got \r\nattention from serious prog fans, because of their modern continuity of GENESIS, through \r\na very rebel rythmic rock sound! <p>Side 1 has an epic track named \"The Last Human Gateway\", lasting near 20 minutes. It is a \r\nvery progressive track, reminding me PINK FLOYD's \"Animals\" and GENESIS of the GABRIEL-\r\nera, with some slightly punk beat and rebel guitar riffs. The next track, \"Through the \r\nCorridors\", unfortunately, is very short, but I really like its real GENESIS sound: very \r\nmelodic and pleasant to listen. <p>Side 2 is VERY interesting: The first track, \"Awake & Nervous\", has excellent drums parts \r\nand moog melodies, and again, it definitely sounds like early GENESIS. The next track, \"My \r\nBaby Treats Me Right 'Cos I'm A Hard Lovin' Man All Night Long\" is a dramatic & passionate \r\npiano solo, a bit like Eddie Jobson's \"Prelude\" on his Green album, but obviously less good \r\nthan Jobson's outstanding solo. The most impressive track of the album is the next \r\ntrack, \"The Enemy Smacks\": WOW! They really get their trademark here! Everything is \r\ncomplex, incisive and progressive! It seems the track is better recorded than the other \r\nones. The guitar is much more melodic, better sounding, and the miscellaneous keyboards \r\nare quite better arranged. The instruments on this track are also more fully interlocking, \r\nand the fast & changing drums never stop to impress!

Yes, their enthusiasm and talent on writing and \r\nperforming is not properly accompanied by a mature sound of their own, and the \r\nproduction feels almost improvised... yet the symptoms of IQ's musical grandeur are there: \r\nattractive and accomplished compositions, passionate interpretations in the vocal parts, \r\ngreat guitar and synth solos, powerful riffs, rich keyboard textures and orchestrations, a \r\ntight rhythm section that solidly manages the complex time signatures, and a certain air of \r\npost-punk fire that adequately refreshes the pompous demands of symph prog. The \r\nopening track, the suite 'The Last Human Gateway' follows in the same vein of \r\npretentiousness and theatrical passion as most of its classic predecessors (Supper's \r\nReady, The Gates of Delirium, In the Dead of Night), but I think that this recorded version \r\nfails to provide a more cohesive unity to sustain the linking of all sections comprised: \r\ndefinitely, a failure in production, but it may also be the result of a lack of complete artistic \r\nmaturity (well, they were already so close to maturity, as 'The Wake' was soon to prove \r\nopenly... but that's another story). But there are also some remarkable good points to this long piece: teh ethreal use of flute mellotron for the opening section, the floating guitar leads during the more melodic climaxes, the sinister instrumental interlude before the last sung section, and finally, the majestic reprise of the first motif by the lead guitar, which pretty much captures the spirit of Genesis' and Camel's vintage splendor. Anyway, I think that their other long compositions, since are not so extended, manage to make it easier for the band to keep control of things. 'Awake and Nervous' displays a fire whose incendiary effect never decreaces during its almost 8 minutes, and the closing gem, 'The Enemy Smacks', conveys the destructive rollercoaster of drug addiction with enthusiastic skill, impressive dexterity and touching dramatism. The latter is one of the most effective IQ compositions regarding their exploration in the darkest side of modern symphonic prog: this is, togetehr with the 'Human Gateway' suite, pure quintaessential first-era IQ. Between these two tracks, a piano solo reminds us of Rachmaninov's waves of sound, in order to give the listener a momentary break - you always need some of that before 'The Enemy Smacks'. While not giving it the perfect rating, I consider it a jewel in any good prog collection.  \r\n </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3595#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3595\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3595\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, May 21, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3595)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI discovered this a few months after the release of their third album , and I was not all that \r\nimpressed but still listened to it as I was plain glad it existed at all.

And nowhere is that more apparent than in this \r\nalbum, \"Tales From the Lush Attic\", as the majority of the textures, rhytmic features, \r\nsong constructions, vocal style and even lyrics are almost pure Gabriel-era Genesis.<p>However, it would be very unfair to dismiss IQ (or any other neo-prog band) as mere \r\nGenesis clones, as IQ went on to greater things, and there is also much in \"Tales...\" \r\nthat is experimental and original - even if it doesn't all work. <p>\"The Last Human Gateway\" begins with a simple, if uninspired flute motif combined \r\nnicely with guitar harmonics and gentle keyboard pads. Nicholls lyrics and vocal style \r\nare set firmly with Gabriel - which sets up my expectations for this piece to pan out \r\nalong the lines of \"Supper's Ready\". There is none of the improvised feel of the latter, \r\nhowever - this first section is in almost pure basic song structure. At around 2:30, a \r\nvery 1980's sounding keyboard provides a somewhat intrusive ostinato - but this does \r\nshatter the illusion of the Genesis expectations aroused earlier. The drums enter \r\naround 3:00, but this is not Collins, and the 16ths sound busy and somewhat hurried. \r\nAt 4:15 there is a return to the Genesis sound - but more in the symphonic vein, with a \r\nbig guitar sound and a short solo worthy of Hackett himself. There are changes a-\r\nplenty in this 20-minute epic, and covering them all would quickly get tedious; Highlights \r\ninclude lyrics like \"I can't go any faster, stuck like alabaster, white, I know\" and some \r\nincredibly inventive moments, such as the \"floaty\" section around 7:30 - which reminds \r\nme of the \"Amanda\" section of \"Creepshow\" by Twelfth Night. IQ then get into a gentle \r\ngroove which mixes up the Genesis sounds with bits of Marillion - but you can distinctly \r\nfeel them trying to break into their own style, which they almost manage aroud 12:30. \r\nI'm not struck at all by the wierd keyboard noises, and this section seems somewhat \r\nsuperfluous - the sense of any drive or drama gets a bit lost in the desire to go all the \r\nway to 20 minutes, and we get more of a sense of \"this section, the next section\" \r\nrather than a free-flowing piece. However, IQ work hard at maintaining some kind of \r\nstructure, the curiosity is engaged, and anyone that likes constantly changing pieces of \r\nmusic will find much to enjoy in here, including some nice melodic work and blustery \r\nnoodling from Holmes.<p>The lyrics to \"Through the Corridors\" are a little disturbing ,smacking slightly of \r\npaedophiliia... and as a piece, it's unremarkable, over-busy generally in the guitar and \r\nlame in the keyboards department - but it's clear nonetheless that IQ were desparately \r\ntrying to establish an original sound, so full kudos to them for that.<p>\"Awake and Nervous\" could really have done with a better keyboard sound for the \r\nintro, but settles into a cool groove before moving into a slightly metal vein and back \r\nagain until the obligatory choir sound around 1:15 heralds Nichols' familiar Gabriel \r\nstrains. To give him his credit, the impersonation is very realistic, and his own melodic \r\ninventiveness very strong, and despite the fact that this sounds very much like a \r\nmissing piece from \"Selling England...\" - or maybe because of that fact, this is a very \r\nstrong track generally - although Cook is no Colllins. The heavier break around 4:45 \r\ngives a nice clue as to where IQ really wanted to take their own style, but move into a \r\nsound that is very close to Mann/Twelfth Night.<p>\"My Baby Treats Me Right \u00b4Cos I\u00b4m A Hard Lovin\u00b4 Man All Night Long\" wins the longest \r\ntitle for the shortest track award, and features Orford doing a party piece on the piano \r\nwith quick ostinati in the right hand and very simple melodic figures in the left. This is \r\none of those pieces that is generally more flash than content, although Orford does \r\nbriefly show a slightly higher than intermediary approach to harmony in welcome \r\nplaces. More generally, not \"Firth of Fifth\", but enjoyable!<p>Another treat for fans of pieces longer than 10 minutes, \"The Enemy Smacks\" manages \r\nto escape the Genesis style on the whole, with a more personal lyric and vocal style. If \r\nonly they could have escaped the cheesey 1980s keyboard sounds, this could have \r\nbeen a really great piece - ie among the greatest that prog has to offer, as it moves \r\nthrough time, key and harmony changes very smoothly and really shows the IQ style \r\nemerging. The main issue I would have is that early in the piece, where there should be \r\na smooth groove, there tends to be a general feeling of lumpiness, and some of the \r\nchanges are over-abrupt, which spoils some of the continuity. On the flip side of the \r\nsame coin, where IQ make it work, especially later, it really works and the changes and \r\ntextures - including those of the keyboards - are deeply satisfying and colour the lyrics \r\nwell and show why IQ were one of the leading lights of neo-prog, and why neo-prog as \r\na genre is not simply a rehash of what went before. This track really is an unpolished \r\nnatural diamond - replete with flaws, and worth buying the album for alone.<p>Since I am reviewing the original vinyl LP, this review ends here, with a strong \r\nrecommendation not just to fans of neo-prog but to prog fans in general - particularly \r\nthose who think that neo-prog is somehow lesser or of lower quality than 1970s prog. \r\nThis incredibly strong debut is proof that in fact, neo-prog is simply \"old school\" prog's \r\nlittle brother - not an inferior entity, but a younger one, which is still maturing.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3599#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3599\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3599\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, February 14, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3599)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=2666\"><strong>Prog-jester</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=2666\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/2666/fdf.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI've been waiting for this CD (along with\"The Wake\") for 4 long months (under some \r\ncircumstances).

The \r\nopening track is pretty good (in my epic-chart it could take the 5th position, after \"Harvest of Souls\" by IQ,\"Supper's Ready\" by you-know-who, \"Grendel\" by you-know-number2 and \"A Change of Seasons\" by Dream Theater) , I especially adore \"A mother's son , a \r\nfather's pride\" part. Tracks 2 and 4 show the Great English Sense of HumoUr; highly \r\nrecommended for those who have it. \"Awake ...\" has dissapointed me at first time as I was expecting much darker track, \"Dark Matter\"-like. Now I like it, it's OK. And the closing \r\nepic has classic, Neo-Prog, Classic Prog, a lullaby, Punk-Rock section and even Blues! The \r\nwhole record is good, I do like it , but it is too uneven. I don't like bonus-\r\ntrack, really; also I'd like to add that quality of this record is very lo-fi-ish as it was \r\nrecorded \"far too quickly\".

Those \r\nfortunate enough to have it, though, are experiencing a masterpiece of progressive \r\nmusic. From the opening flutes of The Last Human Gateway to the closing of The Enemy \r\nSmacks, this album just doesn't lose its appeal and is a massive achievement. The group \r\nsounds almost exactly the same as they did in the 90's, but the group photo in the \r\nsleeve booklet will tell you that the band certainly didn't look the same as they did in \r\nthe 90's (most notable is Mike Holmes hair). The guitar sounds are magnificently \r\ncreated and performed, the bass and drums are dynamic and keep rhythm perfectly \r\nduring the trickier sections of the album. And finally, the keyboards are dynamic and \r\nwonderfully \"lush\", and Peter Nichols never sounded better.<p>The Last Human Gateway, which often is played in sections in the live format, is a epic \r\nthat rarely gets mentioned these days, but it is masterfully played. From the opening \r\nflutes, to the 7/8 section that lasts from 3:30 to 5:00, even under tricky \r\ncircumstances, the band pulls off a wonderfully majestic atmosphere. Through the \r\nCorridors reminds me of Liquid Tension Experiment's Paradigm Shift in that the guitar \r\nplays a similar line of ascending notes while keeping a drone note at machine gun pace. \r\nAwake and Nervous is a ballad of sorts and maintains a wonderfully majestic and \r\noften... dare I say it... nervous atmosphere. My Baby Treats Me Right 'Cos I'm a Hard \r\nLovin' Man All Night Long is the opposite of what you'd expect. What you think will be a \r\nrollicking blues number is in fact a 1:45 grand piano solo from Martin Orford. The Enemy \r\nSmacks, another epic of about 15 minutes in length, goes through many different \r\natmospheres and the vocals are outstanding.<p>Overall, if you like IQ, you need this album. It is essential to any Neo-Prog fan's \r\ncollection and a masterpiece of progressive music. 5/5.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=67356#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=67356\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=67356\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, January 29, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #67356)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5\"><strong>maani</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Founding Moderator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5/klaatu_hopef.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOkay, close your eyes, relax your mind, and travel back in time.<p>It is 1983.  Disco is finally dead, after having joined punk rock in helping \"kill off\" prog \r\n(for the most part) in the mid-70s.  With the possible exceptions of Pink Floyd (who \r\nwere still riding the success of The Wall in 1981), King Crimson (already deep into \r\nits \"second wind\" with Beat), and Rush (who had just released the marvelous Signals), \r\nany \"prog\" bands still extent (Genesis, Yes, Tull et al) had \"gone commercial\" in order to stay \"viable.\"  The predominant trend in commercial rock was the \"80s sound,\" with \r\ncheeky synthesizers, simple studio tricks and flanged voices added to often minimalist \r\nchord progressions and simple arrangements.  The only interesting new music to speak \r\nof was being made by \"new wave\" bands like Talking Heads.<p>And then.something happened.  The unexpected emergence of a new prog \"zeitgeist\" \r\noccurred as if by magic.  The Church, until then a straight-ahead (if good) rock band \r\nwith only occasional prog inflections, released S\u00e9ance, a radical departure from their \r\nnorm.  (They would not release another truly proggish album for five years.)  And two \r\nnew bands - Marillion and IQ - both influenced largely by Genesis, released their debut \r\nalbums, Script for a Jester's Tear and Tales From the Lush Attic, respectively.  These \r\ntwo albums would go on to become among a precious few early masterpieces of what \r\ncame to be called \"neo-prog.\"<p>In reading the reviews of Tales, it seems that everyone has missed an important - \r\nindeed, critical - element of the album: notwithstanding the lack of some segues, Tales \r\nis a concept album from beginning to end.  One need only read through the lyrics of the album, and listen carefully to the underlying musical themes, to see that there is a \r\nsingle continuous story being told.  And although admittedly esoteric, that story has \r\nsimilarities to Genesis' \"The Lamb.\"<p>Where The Lamb was (at least superficially) about two brothers, and the choice that \r\none of them makes to save the other (even if it costs him his own life), Tales is (at least superficially) about a single person with two \"sides,\" how and why those sides develop, and how the two sides fight each other for control.  As well, the title of the first track (The Last Human Gateway, which is death) is an almost too-obvious reference to the similar \"gateway\" that Rael goes through (the \"wall of death is lowered in Times \r\nSquare\"), and the title of the second track (Through the Corridors) is another almost \r\ntoo-obvious reference to the \"corridors\" referred to in \"Carpet Crawlers.\"  Given these \r\nand other similarities, while some reviewers made a connection between the 20-\r\nminute \"Gateway\" and epics such as Supper's Ready, I would make a far more radical \r\nstatement: not content to simply \"take on\" Supper's Ready, Tales essentially \"takes on\" The Lamb - and succeeds beautifully on its own terms.<p>Although not nearly as lyrically or musically cohesive as The Lamb, Tales has all the \r\nright elements: esoteric lyrics; a mix of sweet balladic passages, heavily orchestrated \r\nprogressive passages, and majestic, often exciting keyboard-dominated instrumental \r\nsections; unexpected dynamic changes; quickly shifting time signatures; interesting and well-used sound effects; and a no-holds-barred creativity that brings everything \r\ntogether in gestalt-like fashion - i.e., the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.<p>As I have said before, in my opinion the success of any neo-prog band (and by that I \r\nmean any prog band that appeared after the nine or ten \"seminal\" bands, regardless of their subgenre) is determined by how well they channel their influences; i.e., whether \r\nthey are simply \"copying\" (or, more annoyingly, ripping-off), or whether the result is \r\nsomething new, interesting and/or compelling.  In IQ's case, despite the clear Genesis \r\ninfluence, Tales is not simply interesting, but completely compelling in its own right.  And although Peter Nicholls' voice and approach are often unquestionably Gabriel-esque, you never get the sense that he is \"imitating\"; rather, he is simply applying the same sense of \"dramatic flair\" that Gabriel does - and he is good enough to carry it off \r\nwithout sounding foolish.  (Indeed, over the years I have come to feel that Nicholls has \r\none of the most beautifully expressive voices in prog.)<p>The album does have flaws.  As noted, it is not as cohesive as it might have been.  Indeed, there is a \"joyful naivete\" in its neophyte approach.  And, as others have noted, it suffers a bit from inadequate production.  [N.B.  If this album had been as well-produced as Dark Matter, it would have been a monster, and possibly spoken about in the same breath with the classic concept masterpieces of prog.]<p>However, despite its few flaws - and despite the fact that it does not really measure \r\nup to such seminal classics as The Lamb, In The Court or Close to the Edge - I am giving it five stars - masterpiece status - for three reasons: its historic place in neo-prog; its unapologetic application of the \"classic\" approach to progressive composition; and the sheer creativity of its concept and execution.  It thus joins Museo Rosenbach's \"Zarathustra\" and Spock's Beard's \"The Light\" as the only neo-prog debuts to which I have attributed masterpiece status.<p>For anyone truly interested in the history of prog, and particularly neo-prog, Tales is \r\nunquestionably a must-have album - besides being an absolute joy to listen to.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81557#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81557\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=81557\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 20, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #81557)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is a very significant record, coming out the same year as \"Script For A Jesters Tear\" by \r\nMARILLION. Prog was not dead !  I really like Martin Orford's keyboard \r\nplaying on this album and also the fact he uses mellotron on four of the five tracks (he didn't use it on the \r\nshort instrumental). The star for me though is Peter Nicholls. I have liked his voice from the first time I heard it. This record sounds a little rough at times but as I said in the intro this is truly an important album. I also unlike most prefer it to \"Script...\".<p>The record begins with the almost 20 minute epic \"The Last Human \r\nGateway\" which I feel is the best track on the album. It's very laid back to open and then we hear for the first time Peter's vocals.Suddenly everything is alright in the world. Synths come in followed by drums as the song gets fuller and more passionate. Great sound 5 1/2 minutes in. Orford is all over this. It settles 8 minutes in as mellotron flows. Beautiful acoustic guitar 9 1/2 minutes in, then vocals join in. It kicks in with synths a minute later. Electric guitar 11 1/2 minutes in as synths continue to swirl. The tempo continues to change. Some ripping guitar around 17 minutes. Love when the vocals return, so moving. Mellotron is back too. Yes everything is right in the world. \"Through The Corridors\" really hits the road running. This is a short guitar led tune. It's okay.<p> \"Awake And Nervous\" begins with pulsating synths as drums join in. Great sound. Mellotron before 1 1/2 minutes then vocals. Nice.This moves me. Great track ! Then we have the short, piano laden \r\ninstrumental. Next up is the closer \"The Enemy Smacks\". This is a dark song about heroin \r\naddiction. This song has a bit of an edge, featuring some organ and guitar and of course \r\nkeyboards aplenty. There is also a real nice extended guitar solo, and the vocals don't \r\ndisappoint. I like the calm before 10 1/2 minutes with floating organ and spacey winds.The bonus track \"Just Changing Hands\" features Mike playing a surprisingly \r\nheavy guitar solo, and some more great guitar work later on as well. Martin shows that \r\nyes he can play the keyboards (haha).<p> I really feel that this record \r\nand \"Script For A Jesters Tear\" are must haves for their significance in Prog history. The three long songs on this album are incredible.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=97122#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=97122\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=97122\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, November 5, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #97122)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10301\"><strong>evenless</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFunny to know that IQ's <strong> \"Tales.\" </strong> was released almost simultaneously with \r\nMARILLION's debut album <strong> \"Script.\" </strong> There's not even a very big difference \r\nbetween <em> a tale </em> and <em> a script</em> I would say. :-) <p>Obviously both Marillion and IQ were influenced by GENESIS who had been a permanent \r\nfactor on the British Prog-scene for some 15 years already at the time.<p>The opening track <strong> The Last Human Gateway </strong> definitely is the epic and highlight \r\nof this album, together with the last track <strong> The Enemy Smacks. </strong> All tracks in \r\nbetween are quite okay as well, but not as good as the ones mentioned before.

The same year as \"The Script\", the fantastic \r\nMarillion album. Even if lots of people (including myself) recognize strong influence of \r\nGenesis upon Marillion's work, I would say that is even more obvious with IQ. Their lead \r\nsinger, Peter Nicholls sounds even more to the other Peter, you know the one from... \r\nHe sounds as tortured as him and his vocal play sounds more natural, but less \r\npassionate, than Fish's one. IQ will have a pretty long career (still play together to \r\ndate - 2007) with no so many line-up changes. This is great for the cohesion of course.<p>One must recognize that with the opening number \"The Last Human Gateway\" they are \r\nstriking very hard. An almost twenty minutes long epic with poignant and vibrant \r\nmoments (especially from Nicholls who at times sound absolutely wonderful), spacey \r\nand melodic ones, incredibely touching. There are no unnecessary solo, each member \r\nof the band working really as such. It lacks maybe the grandiose side of the legendary \r\nepics of the genre (\"Supper's Ready\", \"CTTE\", \"Gates\"...) but still, to deliver such piece \r\nof music on a debut album (even if some of them had already play together before \r\nin \"The Lens\") is a remarkable feat of skill. The finale is truely emotional. A great, great \r\npiece of music indeed. <p>To fill up side one, due to the limited amount of space available, we'll get a short rocking \r\nnumber. Good rhythm, good keys. \"Through the Corridors\" is a  pleasant little tune. <p>We are back again in business with \"Awake and Nervous\". One definitely cannot get \r\nasleep with very good rock number. Very good melody again (but these guys know how \r\nto write catchy songs), it sounds almost heavy thanks to Martin Orford great keyboard \r\nplay. This is another highlight of this very interesting album so far.<p>Another interlude with a very long title for a very short song. \"My Baby Treats Me \r\nRight 'Cos I'm A Hard Lovin' Man All Night Long\". I guess that they must have a good \r\nsense of humour since this short part is an all intrumental keyboard piece. One would \r\nahve hoped to listen to some saucy lyrics, but nothing as such. It will only bring us to \r\nthe final number \"The Enemy Smacks\".<p>It is a long piece again (but they will write several long numbers). It is not as brilliant \r\nas \"The Last Human Gateway\", It has a comlex structure but   doesn't work very well \r\non me. Some instrumental parts are too repetitive and lacks in emotion. It sounds very \r\nheavy at times, only the final part has some bombastic sounds. One could have \r\nexpected a more brilliant number to close this album, but then I would have rated as a \r\nmasterpiece.<p>The remastered CD edition features a very good bonus track : \"Just Changing Hands\". \r\nThe chorus is a marvel of a melody while it sounds almsot heavy again during some \r\nintrumental passages. <p>This album is extremely catchy. It perpetrated the music we all (?) love in a period \r\nduring which Yes was producing \"90125\", Tull \"Under Wraps\" and Genesis had \r\nreleased \"Abacab\" two years before. IMO, this album is probably not the best IQ one \r\nbecause some numbers (two) are somewhat weaker but it is rather encouring. Four \r\nstars.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=119992#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=119992\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=119992\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, April 27, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #119992)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHow come I have not reviewed this album yet until today? This is especially when I\r\nclaim myself as a fan of neo prog music? Despite the fact that I only knew this album\r\nafter I enjoyed the band's second album \"The Wake\" which also represented my first\r\nintroduction to the music of IQ. It's always so good to learn the band especially\r\nwhen it first started with the debut album. As I listened to this album after \"The\r\nWake\" and in fact after \"Nomzamo\", spinning this album is really enjoyable. What we\r\nhave here is the original line up of IQ before John Jowitt joined the band. <p>The opening track \"The Last Human Gateway\" (19:57) represents the band's exploration\r\ninto symphonic prog music in its best. Even though the recording quality sounds raw\r\nbut it still not bad in sonic quality especially with the excellent composition of\r\neach track featured here. One might find how the music changes its style and tempo\r\nfrom the opening part, middle of the track especially when guitar fills overlay the\r\nlong sustain keyboard work. It's so nice. The band also demonstrates how good they\r\nare in creating catchy and memorable melodies through vocal line and musical chords\r\nand notes. Peter Nichols sings beautifully and his voice has become a trademark of IQ\r\nmusic. Martin combines his work as rhythm section and some keyboard solo which\r\ncreates good textures of the music. Tim Essau provides tight bass lines during this\r\ntrack.<p>\"Through The Corridors\" (2:35) is almost a rocker with inventive keyboard work by\r\nMartin and powerful vocal line by Peter. Mike Holmes provides excellent guitar work\r\nto support the keyboard part. His style sounds like Steve Hackett, sometimes. \"Awake\r\nAnd Nervous\" (7:45) is the band's classic which then became live favorites. It has\r\nbeautiful keyboard, nice music riffs and excellent vocal line. \"My Baby Treats Me\r\nRight \u00b4Cos I\u00b4m A Hard Lovin\u00b4 Man All Night Long\" (1:45) is a short bridge that\r\ncontains a really nice piano solo work heavily influenced by classical music. Even\r\nthough it's relatively a short track, I really enjoy it. \"The Enemy Smacks\" (13:49)\r\nis one of my favorite IQ songs. I like the energy, the dynamic composition and how\r\nthe combination of guitar, keyboard and vocal provides good harmony. Observe the\r\nopening part and then enjoy the part when Peter first enters the vocal line. The\r\nmusic then moves beautifully in relatively fast tempo with great melody. It's kicking! <p>Overall, this is an excellent addition to any prog music collection. By the time of\r\nwriting this review, I have enjoyed all studio albums by IQ and to me IQ is probably\r\nthe only band who is still consistent in the style of music they are making and\r\nplaying until today. You would not have any trouble assessing the music of IQ even\r\nfrom this excellent debut album. It will give you the whole picture of IQ music.\r\n<strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=121056#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=121056\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=121056\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 7, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #121056)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1820\"><strong>NJprogfan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI have to agree on almost every point of Salmacis's review. There is a knawing feeling of \r\nGenesis cloning on IQ's first album, but it's not a copycat. Nicholl does his best imitation of \r\nGabriel on this album, especially on \"The Last Human Gateway\". The gripes I have with this \r\nalbum are Cook's drumming, which misses the pace of the band on some of the first track \r\nand on \"The Enemy Smacks\" and Peter's vocals are mixed somewhat muddily getting buried \r\nby most of the band, (I'm a BIG fan of his lyrics). Orford's keyboards are fine using \r\nMellotron with good taste in spots, but of course better things are to come. The gothicness \r\nof the following album and beyond are hinted in spots, (\"Awake and Nervous\" for \r\ninstance). And you'll hear the signature IQ sound around the 5 minute mark on the first \r\ntrack. This album smacks of first album syndrome, muddy production, out of sync drumming \r\nand wearing your influences on your sleeve, but by their next album, (\"The Wake\") it all \r\njells. I still believe they're more classically progressive on their first album then any Marillion \r\nalbum, (but that's my opinion...) even with Fish, but I can only give this particular disc 3 \r\nstars, (4 if you're an IQ fanatic). BTW, if you get the InsideOut version, not only will you \r\nget a bonus track, there's a hidden track that's basically an instrumental ditty with an \r\nAsian/Indian flavor....kinda neat and unexpected to say the least.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=122147#social-comments\"

Holmes in 1981.A year later they released a (hard to find nowadays) debut cassette entitled ''Seven stories into eight'' and in 1983 it was time for their debut LP ''Tales from the lush attic''.From the very first listen the love of the band for Gabriel-era GENESIS is more than obvious.The album is characterized by the lush keyboard sounds,the well-crafted guitar solos and the impressive,sensitive voice of vocalist Peter Nicholls.Not surprisingly IQ were and still are considered a major name progressive rock and their first effort prooves why.The long compositions,the intense atmosphere,the nice vocal lines and the extensive GENESIS-like instrumental passages complete a very attractive package that should please every progressive rock fan.Definitely a masterpiece of the 80's!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=146590#social-comments\"

additions to the \r\nIQ discography, listen to them carefully and you will hear faint echoes of this previous masterpiece \r\nseeping through the very pores of the music, so important was thIS initial masterwork in setting up the \r\njourney ahead that lay in-front of the band in terms of musical evolution.<p>'Tales From The Lush Attic' was, amazingly, recorded in just under 4 days during August 1983, making the \r\nalbums inception, creation and distribution all the more impressive considering the fish-mania and general \r\nMarillion-loving that was sweeping the UK, EUROPE and the good old U S of A.\r\nIt was produced independently, on a modest budget, with little-or-no record-company support and \r\nfeatured none of the excessive instrumentation so beloved of their mentors from the 1970's.<p>All the band had was drums, voices, keyboards, Guitars and Basses. <p>No funky tron, no studio wizardry.<p>Just the band.<p>And the what a great album it is.<p>Album closer 'The Enemy Smacks' is the undoubted highlight, featring cosmic keyboards and some \r\nextraordinarily imaginative guitar-playing, but to choose a favourite is difficult; there is barely a dud-note \r\nto be heard.<p>IQ have gone from strength-to-strength in recent years('Nomzano' excepted) and for anyone curious \r\nabout the bands beginnings, 'Tales From The Lush Attic' is a great entry-point to a fascinating group.<p>I look forward to their next release knowing that, if it shows half the invention shown here, then we'll be in \r\nfor a real treat.<p>STEFAN TURNER, LONDON, 2008<p>

I was introduced \r\nto IQ through their Seventh House ( 2000) album, which was their new album at the time when I \r\npurchased it, and I have since purchased almost anything the band has released. My initial interest in \r\nIQ stems from a recommendation I got that IQ was similar to Fish era Marillion which happens to be \r\nsome of my favorite music. There are generally many similarities between IQ and Marillion but there \r\nare just as many differences. Tales from the Lush Attic is actually one of the last IQ albums I have \r\npurchased as it\u00b4s only recently that I knew of its existence.<p>The music is in the neo-progressive style which means that the keyboard sounds that are used instantly \r\ngives away the fact that this music was made in the eighties. Just as the case is with Marillion, IQ is \r\nvery influenced by seventies Genesis but their overall sound is very different from Genesis sound \r\nbecause of the eighties sound and production. The mood on the album is predominantly melancholic. \r\nThe music is dominated by keyboards but guitar, bass and drums also has place in the soundscape, \r\nespecially the melodic guitars has to be mentioned as another dominant part of IQ\u00b4s sound. The vocals \r\nfrom Peter Nicholls are very distinct ( a cross between Peter Gabriel/ Fish) and gives IQ much of their \r\nidentity ( he would leave for a period in the late eighties and IQ suffered greatly because of the loss. \r\nHe proved to be impossible to replace).<p>The album starts with the 19:57 minute long The Last Human Gateway which is a great epic track with \r\nmany different parts. Very Genesis inspired. The short guitar dominated Through The Corridors \r\nreminds me of Marillion. Awake And Nervous is my favorite here. Great emotional and powerful track. \r\nThe strangely titled My Baby Treats Me Right \u00b4Cos I\u00b4m A Hard Lovin\u00b4 Man All Night Long is actually a \r\nclassically inspired piano piece even though I thought it might be a rock\u00b4n\u00b4roll song with that title. \r\nGreat little piece. The Enemy Smacks is a 13:49 minute long epic track and again I\u00b4m happy about the \r\nsound of this. Great song. The CD bonus track Just Changing Hands is good but not excellent IMO.<p>The musicianship is pretty good even though there are parts that seem a bit naive. I really like the \r\nenergetic drumming ( with that thin eighties sound that reminds me of Script for A Jester\u00b4s Tear by \r\nMarillion). There are some great keyboard and guitar performances here too while Peter Nicholls is still \r\nyoung and not as commanding in his vocal performance as on later releases. His performance is still \r\ngood though.<p>The production is really thin and with a sound like this it will always be an aquired taste if it suits your \r\ntaste. I rather enjoy it. Think of how the sound quality is on Marillion\u00b4s Grendel track and you\u00b4re just \r\nabout there.<p>I\u00b4m a bit surprised that I enjoy this album as much as I do, but sometimes lightning strikes and you \r\ndon\u00b4t know why. For all its flaws I still think that Tales from the Lush Attic is an excellent debut and it \r\ndeserves somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. I\u00b4ll round it up this time and give it 4 stars as I really find \r\nit enjoyable.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=189799#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=189799\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=189799\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, November 18, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #189799)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4373\"><strong>Tom Ozric</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=4373\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/4373/image.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWhilst Neo-Prog may not be everyone's favourite Prog sub-genre, there are a few stand-out \r\nexamples that appeared during the first half of the 80's that endeavoured to keep the Prog \r\ntorch aflame - I.Q.'s 'Tales From The Lush Attic'  being one such statement.  First hitting the \r\nshelves early in 1983 on a private label by the name of  'The Major Record Company' , the \r\nalbum featured 5 tracks of expectant progressive technicality.   The opening piece is an epic \r\ntitled 'The Last Human Gateway' - it clocks in at just over 19 minutes (according to my stop-\r\nwatch - no CD lover here....). The album offers a styling of music that many have grown to love - \r\nthe highly imaginative ideals of a band whose name 'Genesis' meant more to their taste than \r\nmere 'top-forty trash' at this time in their lives.   Moogs and Mellotrons aplenty, the guys in this \r\nband put their money where their mouth was when it comes to instrumental proficiency.  All \r\nmusical members of this band shine - fantastic Keyboards ( yeah, Tony Banks is a great \r\ninfluence....), Guitaring (yeah, Steve Hackett is a great influence), vocals (yeah, Peter Gabriel is \r\na great influence).  Drummer Paul Cook does recall Phil Collins or maybe even Rush's Neil \r\nPeart, and Bassist Tim Esau blends Mike Rutherford's melodicism with Chris Squire's ego.  \r\nAll-in-all, an amazing blend of talent.  I struggle to find any weak moment here;  odd-time sigs, \r\nnatural changes of tempo, way too many highlights to mention - at least to my ears, this is a 5-\r\nstar album.  I have held it in high regard since I acquired it 15 years ago, and recently decided \r\nto give it another whirl.  MAGNIFICENT !!!  Open your mind and enjoy.  5 Stars.  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=256638#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=256638\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=256638\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, December 18, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #256638)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15205\"><strong>Nightfly</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15205\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15205/cover_183682442007.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBack in the early eighties, of the so called neo prog movement IQ were one of the most \r\npromising bands to emerge and to this day remain one of the finest exponents of the \r\ngenre. In fact I've always believed that Tales From The Lush Attic is a superior release to \r\nMarillion's Script, released the same year. <p>Like all the bands that arrived with the new wave of prog in the early eighties IQ took their \r\ncue from the prog legends of the seventies, in the case of IQ particularly Genesis, at least \r\nat this early stage. I seem to remember an early interview with the band at the time claiming \r\nthat they were keen to bring modern and more commercial influences into prog (just look at \r\nMike Holmes haircut to see where they were coming from!) to take it to a wider audience \r\nbut in truth there's (thankfully in view of how much eighties music has aged) little of that. \r\nVocalist Pete Nicholls, now a fine singer in his own right is clearly influenced by Peter \r\nGabriel here but it's evident that he still had much to learn as his voice occasionally falters \r\nand struggles to hit notes. The band put on a decent performance though, Martin Orford in \r\nparticular showing that he was already a more than competent keyboard player.<p>Musically IQ remain to my ears the most inventive neo prog band of the time, less \r\npredictable than the competition with some strong instrumental passages with Orford's \r\nvintage keyboards playing a prominent role. Awake And Nervous remains my favourite \r\nmoment with its catchy and instantly memorable opening synth line. Mellotron lovers \r\nshould be happy as Orford tends to take centre stage here on this lively piece. Not \r\nsurprisingly though most attention will be drawn to the twenty minute long The Last Human \r\nGateway which takes up most of side one on my original vinyl version. A flute like mellotron \r\nleads in a restrained start with Nicholl's best Gabriel impersonation as the track builds into \r\na diverse piece shifting through many moods and changes from the powerful to the \r\nsublime with some inventive chord structures.<p>Not surprisingly IQ still had much to learn and would go on to release much better albums \r\nin the future, not least their most recent Frequency, which I believe to be their best yet. \r\nNevertheless Tales From The Lush Attic still stands today and was a promising debut; the \r\nbest of the bunch in fact at the time. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284614#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284614\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284614\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 2, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284614)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8691\"><strong>Flucktrot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8691\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070908_201329_joshuatree.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBy 1983, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull had either sold out, lost considerable prog\r\nmotivation or simply broken up. From any perspective, there wasn't much hope for symphonic prog. But\r\nthen along comes IQ (and of course here is the obligatory Marillion mention, although I'm more\r\naligned with the IQ camp) and we have a fairly decent epic and some clear symphonic flair. I was too\r\ncaught up in whatever was being marketed at the time to notice. Perhaps if I'd spoken with my\r\nwallet, in addition to many other proggers, this album would have larger status today.<p>Or perhaps not, because while their heart was in the right place, this is far from a perfect, or\r\neven revolutionary album. But I have to give some historical credit for going against the\r\ngrain--even if it had been done 10 years earlier, few were doing it then.<p>The Last Human Gateway is a very solid epic, probably in my top 100 epics, if that provides any\r\nperspective. In fact, if most of the song was as good as the first 8 minutes, we may have had one of\r\nthe all time greats, because this segment features an inspired buildup, mostly in 7/4 time no less!\r\nThere are a few sloppy moments, but they are quite tight during this sequence--impressive for a\r\ndebut album! Unfortunately, we are then faced with a hit-and-miss march to the largely satisfying\r\nfinale (along the way is an absolutely wince-inducing synth).<p>The Enemy Smacks is less a cohesive song as opposed to a collection of only sometimes interesting\r\nmusical ideas. I do enjoy the 17/8 time guitar/bass unison playing near the beginning, but that's\r\ncounterbalanced by some fairly poor vocals by Peter near the end. A fun song, but the band would\r\ntighten up their compositions considerably in the following decades.<p>I like this band, and by extension it's just fun to hear their roots. They made a definitive prog\r\nstatement and largely held to that, with largely the same musicians, for nearly 30 years. Thanks for\r\nsticking with it, IQ!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=285584#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=285584\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=285584\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 8, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #285584)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>The humble beginnings of IQ</strong><p>Tales From The Lush Attic was IQ's first studio album release and it is an immature but partly promising affair. Two of the tracks are very long, namely the opening and closing tracks, The Last Human Gateway and The Enemy Smacks, the first of which runs for close to 20 minutes in classic Prog fashion. The shortest cut runs for less than two minutes but has the longest <em>title</em>: My Baby Treats Me Right \u00b4Cos I\u00b4m A Hard Lovin\u00b4 Man All Night Long! The best track, however, is Awake And Nervous, which is also the one that most clearly points toward the future of the band. The Genesis influence is very obvious throughout, and Peter Nicholls emulates Peter Gabriel quite well. On Awake And Nervous I feel, however, that IQ took the first trembling steps toward finding their own sound and style. And this song together with (parts of) The Last Human Gateway occur frequently in the band's live set until the present day and are rightly considered IQ classics.<p>While the epic The Last Human Gateway has some great parts, it comes across as overlong and lacking a clear direction. It seems that the band bit off more than they were able to chew here with a composition on such a grand scale. And the band themselves would evidently agree with me as on several more recent live airings of this piece they played only the middle and sometimes also end sections of it (see, for example, the live album Forever Live recorded on the tour in support of Ever in the early 90's and the live DVD Stage recorded and filmed on the tour in support of Dark Matter in 2005). As I said, there are indeed some great parts in there and it was therefore a very good idea to cut it up and perform only the better parts of it live (even though some fans would certainly disagree with me on this). <p>The album as a whole shares some aspects of The Last Human Gateway as it tends to drag in some parts. Most of the other songs are not particularly memorable and they do not have the same impact on me. Only the best parts stand out and these can, as I hinted at above, be found in better-sounding versions on several live albums together with other IQ classics. Another problem is the subpar production which makes this album pale in comparison with other Neo-Prog albums from the same period such as the albums by Marillion. The weak production also makes this album sound a bit dated. Sonic quality is not everything, of course. Having great tunes is the most important thing and if there are such a bad sound and production may be forgiven. But as implied, the quality of the compositions is not up for it.\r\n \r\nThe next album would be a bit more focused, but as far as I'm concerned the peak of the band's career was still many years away at this stage. In my opinion, IQ wouldn't really find their own musical direction and identity until later on. What can be found here are only the seeds of what was to be. This can thus only be recommended for fans of the band and collectors of early British Neo-Prog.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=304643#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=304643\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=304643\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 16, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #304643)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11349\"><strong>kenethlevine</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog-Folk Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11349\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11349/PC-Cat.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n1983 was indeed a difficult time for progressive rock fans.  Most of the giants of the British scene\r\nwere out of commission or at least in serious decline.  The internet was still a dozen odd years\r\noff, and, through the negligence of commercial and non-commercial radio alike, few of us realized\r\nthat progressive rock was quietly plodding on in non Anglophone countries.  In fact, Germany, Italy,\r\nFrance and Japan, to name a few, had been producing better quality output than the UK or America for\r\nsome time.   Only under such circumstances could the \"new wave\" of English neo prog have made such\r\nan impact, and it did.\r\n<p>\r\nI never really caught the gist of this genre.  From the first time I heard \"Script for Jester's\r\nTear\" in its entirety on a local radio station obviously pitching to its boomer audience, all I\r\nheard was vocalists trying to sound like PETER GABRIEL and instrumentalists trying to sound like\r\nTONY BANKS, STEVE HACKETT and PHIL COLLINS.   IQ's debut is cut from a slightly more ragged but\r\nequally influence-saturated cloth.  I do hear other contemporaries like RUSH as well as typical 1980s\r\nrock.  But what I don't hear nearly enough of is IQ.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery time I listen, I feel that the tracks that sounded good the previous time sound mediocre now,\r\nand the ones that sounded dreadful before sound merely mediocre.  This is partly due to the group's\r\nover ambitiousness on the lengthier cuts.  \"The Last Human Gateway\" begins hopefully and includes\r\nsome fine passages both upbeat and mellow, but also some dire segments, particularly one that sounds\r\nlike the backing is being played by 1000 6 year old future violin virtuosos.

It\r\nwas only when I heard IQ's 'Tales From The Lush Attic' that my faith in neo-prog was restored, and\r\nalso when I started to take neo-prog seriously. This is because IQ's 'Tales...' is nothing short of\r\na classic, and it's a stunning debut (if you don't count the cassette only 'Seven Stories Into Eight').<p>To start with, the album opener <strong>The Last Human Gateway</strong> is 20 minutes long. For an album\r\nreleased in 1983, this is extremely impressive, and shows that the band had enough musical integrity\r\nto write something truly progressive in a time when prog was quite a dirty word. The song itself is\r\nmindblowing. This is a multi-part suite with beautiful melodies, complex musicianship, emotive\r\npassages and amazing songwriting. To be honest, the only reason IQ are listed as being neo-prog is\r\nbecause they formed in the 1980s. This is actually symphonic prog all the way. There are plenty of\r\nodd time signatures to enjoy in this astonishing track. It's true that IQ roll out some progressive\r\nclich\u00e9s, but this being the 1980s, it would be hard not to take some inspiration from older groups,\r\nand the way they use these 'clich\u00e9s' is wonderful and cannot be criticised. One part of this\r\nextroadinary piece I'd like to refer to is at 17:28, when they slow down into a triumphant keyboard\r\nsound. Remind you of any other prog rock epic? \"Yes\" is the answer, as this was almost certainly\r\ninspired by the device used in <strong>The Gates Of Delirium</strong> at 12:35. One strange thing though, at\r\nthe very beginning of this song, there is a quiet wooshing sound that continues for 75 seconds. This\r\nis yet another prog rock clich\u00e9, but it's a bit cheeky as it brings the song to exactly 20 minutes.\r\nNevertheless, I love this track dearly and it should be ranked alongside <em>Close To The Edge</em>,\r\n<em>Supper's Ready</em> and the like. Just like <em>Supper's Ready</em>, this piece isn't a 'side-long'.<p>The brief song that filled up the rest of the side is known as <strong>Through The Corridors</strong>. The\r\nstriking thing about this track is Mike Holmes's fiddly guitar work throughout the song! Very\r\ncomplex and speedy indeed. This track has a more punky feel to it, but it is keyboard driven in\r\nparts. A very fun track indeed.<p>The next song, <strong>Awake and Nervous</strong> has become something of an IQ staple in live shows, their\r\n<em>Roundabout</em> if you will. This is a very well written, emotive piece, but it was only when I\r\nsaw videos of IQ playing this live that I realised just how much I enjoyed it. The instrumental may\r\nbe a little short for my liking, but when the 7/8 riff returns at 5:50, it is a thing of sheer beauty.<p><strong>My Baby Treats Me Right 'Cos I'm A Hard Lovin' Man All Night Long</strong> is an piano solo by Martin\r\nOrford that is over before you have time to say the title of this song (well not quite). It is just\r\nanother progressive clich\u00e9, performing the same duty as Yes's <em>The Clap</em> or Genesis's\r\n<em>Horizons</em>. Very well played, but I've never been a fan of solo tracks on band records.<p>Despite it's silly name, <strong>The Enemy Smacks</strong> is an impressive song, boasting a lot of prog for\r\nyour money. At nearly 14 minutes in length, this track features multiple parts, amazing progressive\r\nsongwriting, and a striking 4:40 instrumental section. This instrumental section features a\r\nwonderful blend of prog and blues that feels wholly original. This is a staggeringly epic track and\r\nit's not to be taken lightly!<p>Many people see 'The Wake' as IQ's standout record, when I think this is entirely false. 'Tales From\r\nThe Lush Attic' is a prog rock masterpiece and deserves far more respect than it recieves. This is a\r\nshining beacon of prog released in the progressive wasteland known as 'The 80s'. I personally find\r\nthis record deeply inspiring.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=434176#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=434176\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=434176\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, April 15, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #434176)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>The Genesis of IQ?</strong><p>To start from the beginning of the IQ story, we have to go back 30 years to the early 1980's. \r\nWhile seldom credited as the <em>inventors</em> of neo-prog, the band were certainly among \r\nthe pioneers of the genre, They took their influences, as others around the same time, from \r\nthe work of Genesis in the 1970's, thus carrying the banner for a style of music which \r\nGenesis themselves would famously move away from. While IQ did release material prior \r\nto this on a cottage industry basis, \"Tales from the lush attic\" is generally accepted as \r\nbeing their first proper album. <p>The album opens in the true traditions of prog with a wildly ambitious 20 minute track \r\nentitled \"The Last Human Gateway\". In many ways, this wonderful epic sets the template \r\nnot just for subsequent IQ songs, but for large scale productions by many of their peers. \r\nYes we are immediately struck by the passing similarities between the voice of  Peter \r\nNicholls and that of Peter Gabriel, yes we notice the Tony Banks like synth chorales of \r\nMartin Orford, and of course the guitars of Mike Holmes have echoes of the great sounds of \r\nSteve Hackett, BUT I challenge anyone to actually come up with a Genesis song which \r\nsounds remotely like this. This is not a patchwork of unconnected songs (\"Supper's ready\") \r\nan extended instrumental interlude (\"Cinema show\") or a verbose fantasy story (\"Battle of \r\nEpping Forest\"); it is a singular piece which actually has most in keeping with \r\nMarillion's \"Grendel\" from a similar period (OK, and maybe a bit of \"The knife\"!). <p>Perhaps, in the true traditions of Genesis, we have a couple of tracks here which may be \r\nsaid to be included simply to lighten the overall feel. So it is with \"Through The Corridors\", a \r\nfrantic race through a pleasantly inoffensive ditty and \" My Baby Treats Me Right \u00b4Cos I'm A \r\nHard Lovin\u00b4 Man All Night Long\", a convoluted title for a \"Lick my love pump\" like piano \r\nrecital.<p>Were it not for these two brief tracks, we would perhaps be more likely to compare this \r\nalbum with the likes of \"Close to the edge\" and \"Relayer\", as we are effectively left with an \r\nalbum which in its original format had one side long track, and one side with two extended \r\npieces. \"Awake And Nervous\" is for me the weakest of the long numbers. It has many of the \r\nright tenets, including an upbeat pace, guitar and synth breaks, and a decent vocal melody, \r\nbut for me it is rather disjointed. <p>At almost 14 minutes, \"The Enemy Smacks\" can claim to be the album's second main \r\nfeature. Here we have a fine extended instrumental section to enjoy, the track \r\ncomplementing the epic on side one perfectly.<p>The remastered CD has one additional track called \"Just Changing Hands\". While it is \r\nhardly worth chasing that release for, the track is very much in keeping with the music on \r\nthe original album.<p>In all, a fine first album from a band who would go on to record many more. An essential \r\nlisten for those who are already familiar with IQ's later offerings. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=541696#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=541696\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=541696\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 4, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #541696)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's first LP shows a more pronounced Genesis influence than their more diverse demo tape \r\nSeven Stories Into Eight, which preceded it, but what the band gave up in variety for this one \r\nthey more than gained in songwriting prowess. In particular, on this album they mastered the \r\nart of evoking a strange, esoteric atmosphere which is unique to them. The main attractions \r\nare the two long songs, The Last Human Gateway and The Enemy Smacks, the songs \r\nbetween them being a slightly more light-hearted interlude. (My Baby Treats Me Right \u00b4Cos I\u00b4m \r\nA Hard Lovin\u00b4 Man All Night Long, in particular, is nothing more than the intro to The Enemy \r\nSmacks played on piano.)

Prog is supposedly as dead as the proverbial doornail. And yet, there were all those stories in Sounds music paper about \r\nthese new bands, who liked dressing up a bit, played \"proper\" music, with commercial sensibilities, and liked, gasp, Genesis. In \r\nfact, they apparently sounded a bit like them.<p>It was all a bit too much for us slightly nerdy types who continued to express our opinion that Floyd could play, and that New \r\nRomanticism was, basically, a pile of crap. It didn't get us laid very often, of course, but, hey, that's the price you pay!<p>So, a visit to the local record shop (when you had one in each town) in 1983 was a bit of a treat when presented with the debuts of \r\nthe two neo giants, Marillion with Script....and this incredible work from IQ, still, in my opinion, the band who have stayed perhaps \r\nthe closest to their musical roots over the years.<p>Founded by guitarist Mike Holmes, this collective could certainly play, and the opening track, The Last Human Gateway, was a \r\nstunning statement of intent, coming in at just short of twenty minutes, featuring the most delicate and angsty English vocals from \r\nPeter Nicholls since, well, a certain Mr Gabriel. Featuring flute, swirling keyboards, complex guitar and rhythm section, in places \r\nvery much Yes driven, this was almost revelatory at the time, and, whilst it is fair to say that the production nowadays sounds rather \r\nweedy and light, it still stands up remarkably well as a piece of music.<p>It is, perhaps, unfair to single out any particular member of this collective, but this album was the start of a personal musical love \r\naffair with Martin Orford that lasts to this day, and I very much hope we have not heard the last of him as  a performing artist on a \r\nfull time basis, for his work here is simply stunning. And as for those who thought that prog rockers were just a bunch of po-faced \r\nnerds, his wonderful piano solo piece on the hilariously named My Baby Treats Me Right Cos I'm a Hard Loving Man All Night Long \r\nis moving and classically driven. I would love to know just how the title came about!<p>Some of it, of course, now sounds pretty dated, particularly the \"by numbers\" Awake and Nervous, but I still get a great deal of \r\npleasure in listening to the vinyl copy closer, The Enemy Smacks, with its delicate guitar work, delicious time signatures, dark \r\norgans, very introspective lyrics, vocals which still have me at times checking to see whether Hamill guested, and, well, confirmation \r\nto us at this exciting time that the prog \"revival\" was not to be a short lived experience.<p>We have debated neo prog quite a lot recently on this site, and it prompted me to get this out and revisit my late teens and jot down \r\na few thoughts.<p>This is an important album in prog rock history. Whilst outsold by its better known peer Script, a situation which would continue and \r\nwiden of course, this album spawned a fanatical fan base which has stayed loyal ever since, and I am happy to count myself \r\namongst that number.<p>Four stars. An excellent and critical addition to any prog collection, falling just short of masterpiece. They saved those for later. In \r\nfact, they are still producing them.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=901881#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=901881\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=901881\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, January 29, 2013</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #901881)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFormed by Mike Holmes and Martin Orford all the way back in 1981, IQ were amongst the first bands in the 80s to resurrect the styles of Genesis and Yes and progressive rock in general along with other early neo-prog pioneers Marillion, Pendragon, Twelfth Night, Pallas and others. Although this debut album by IQ starts out sounding like a mere Genesis clone with Gabriel era vocals and keyboard runs, it really picks up after few minutes and takes the listener on most unexpected journeys. <p>Genesis were masters of creating a new sound and then suddenly jettisoning it in favor of a new one. In the wake of their musical disposals first encountered on \"Trespass\" countless bands hungrily devoured the carcasses of their former sounds and incorporated them into their musical beings. After Gabriel left, the band changed their sound to a more neo-prog sound and eventually to a symphonic pop sound abandoning all the prog they so ambitiously created in the first place. Bands like IQ boldly resurrected these progressive traits first heard in the 70s and added a little zing to the whole mix.<p>TALES FROM THE LUSH ATTIC expands the Genesis inspired universe into farther reaches of that musical universe. Technically the second album after the cassette-only \"Seven Stories Into Eight\" it was nonetheless the first major release. Although Peter Nicholls echoes the Gabriel era of Genesis, at times he actually sounds like a bit like Rikk Emmett of Triumph at times showing a more diverse range in the octave department. <p>This album is a surprise actually. Coming to this late in the game after hearing the 21st century releases first, i have to say that i really love this debut. It shows great maturity in the composition department and the musicianship is on an excellent level matching that of any technical level of other 80s genres such as metal, jazz or classical. Martin Orford is particularly brilliant on the keyboards on this one and i even hear a little Philip Glass wizardry influence here and there. The rest of the band is nothing less than phenomenal in their ability to maintain a tight and steady progressive time signature frenzy as well. <p>A very promising start to a long lasting career with this one and even though there were a few speed bumps on the way, IQ has remained a steady and incrementally waxing force in the progressive rock arena for three decades at this point (2014). I find the music on this one brilliant but it is the blatant Gabriel vocal impersonation here that keeps me from rating this higher. It's just tooooo Peter most of the time. The best parts are the instrumental ones but even with vocals as they are and all i still really dig this scene.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1341473#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1341473\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1341473\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, January 7, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1341473)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=55974\"><strong>Magnum Vaeltaja</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=55974\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/55974/herbie-hancock-sextant-cover-1202-x-1200_-_Copy_2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn the midst of the 1980's, when the prog giants turned to pop and AOR, IQ stood true to the genre's fundamentals \r\nas one of the most talented, competent and creative of neo-prog groups. Although they'd soon go the commercial route, too, with the more new wave and pop-influenced releases that they're churning out even to this day, this debut LP \"Tales From The Lush Attic\" found the band filling their symphonic shoes and running a marathon. The album spans 5 tracks, ranging from short interludes to grandiose epics and each song is crafted wonderfully and with care and emotion, even the \"filler\" tracks. <p> Now, just who is IQ? Well, Genesis, frankly. Or so the accusations are made: \"hero worshippers\", \"plagiarists\", \"copycats\", all of which are titles that this debut has earned IQ. It really is impossible to deny the obvious Genesis influence that defines this album. However, I don't see it as a weakness at all. In fact, the blatant Genesis cloning is what makes this album truly great. Where Genesis was rich in inspiration, they were pretty down lousy at making flawless albums. For all of their greatest highs, they had equally magnitudinal lows. Whether it was the unnecessary and unfunny attempts at comedy like \"Harold the Barrel\" or \"Epping Forest\", soulless and mechanical material like \"Watcher of the Skies\", or putting awkward verses into what would have been a perfect instrumental (*cough* Firth of Fifth *cough*), Genesis just had a real knack for watering down their best output. <p> But \"Tales From The Lush Attic\"? This album is all killer, no filler, baby. Each track is a substantial, developed, well-paced, and well-placed musical experience. As well, frontman Peter Nicholls, while sounding very similar to Peter Gabriel, has much less rasp to his voice, leading to a more refined, less abrasive listening experience, all while retaining the same emotional wealth. The best part, though? IQ has far more instrumental firepower than Genesis ever did. No flaccid Tony Banks tinkling to be heard here, and no dated-sounding Hackett guitar tones. Instead we have the boisterous and confident-sounding attack of four top notch players who have no trouble getting a little untamed when the music calls for it. The only thing that I think might make this album even better would be if they included more acoustic sections, as that was the one thing that classic Genesis did nail consistently. That really is just a minor complaint, though, because this is high calibre symphonic prog through and through. <p> So why don't I give this release 5 stars? Simply because IQ found a way to make it even better. The definitive version of this album that you should seek out is the Giant Electric Pea 30th Anniversary re-release. The production is fantastic and it includes several bonus tracks such as the shorter ballad \"Wintertell\", the dramatic and well-orchestrated \"Dans Le Parc Du Chateau Noir\" and \"Just Changing Hands\", a jam-like instrumental that shows off the band's soloing capabilities. <p> So there you have it. This isn't just Genesis revisited, this is Genesis improved. Truly an excellent addition to any prog collection. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1456595#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1456595\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1456595\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, August 26, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1456595)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11816\"><strong>Modrigue</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11816\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11816/PA-Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Tales From The Genesis Attic</strong><p>As one of the first neo-progressive album, with MARILLION's \"Script for a Jester's Tear\", \"Tales\r\nFrom The Genesis Attic\" is in fact IQ's second album, after the cassette-only \"Seven Stories into\r\nEight\". Greatly influenced by symphonic early GENESIS, the music lacks a bit of creativity and\r\nidentity. Furthermore, Peter Nicholls' voices is strongly similar to Peter Gabriel's. Still\r\nnowadays, IQ remains the \"classic\" neo-prog band the most resembling GENESIS. <p>Recorded in only in five days, the composition is also not always mastered. However, the music\r\nmanages to bring a few scattered new 80's elements and the result is overall pleasant.<p>The 20 minutes \"The Last Human Gateway\" is one of the longest progressive suite from the beginning\r\nof the 80's. It contains different ambiances typical of symphonic rock, mixed with eighties'\r\nsonorities: hard rocking epic passages, haunting atmospheres, calm spacey interludes, as well as\r\naverage and cheesy moments. The synthesizer solos are not always convincing, the result is uneven\r\nand sometimes sounds unbalanced. However, this song is overall varied and nice. After all, at this\r\ntime, progressive music was not very popular, and not many tracks were this adventurous. The short\r\n\"Through The Corridors\" is a punchy pleasant hard prog piece.<p>\"Awake And Nervous\" is also enjoyable, with some rocking passages, while \"My Baby Treats Me Right\"\r\nis a small pretty piano interlude. Nonetheless, the best track of side 2 and of the record is \"The\r\nEnemy Smacks\". More coherent than the opener, this song possesses his own charm, even if the\r\nmellotron, guitar and Nicholls' singing clearly exposes the band's GENESIS' and PINK FLOYD's roots.\r\nIt features a catchy opening, nervous moments and melancholic atmospheres different from the\r\nseventies' classic prog material. <p>The bonus track \"Just Changing Hands\" is optional.<p>Although a bit immature, not always mastered and marked by the influences of Peter Gabriel and co.,\r\n\"Tales From The Lush Attic\" is nevertheless a promising album. As MARILLION, IQ incorporates the\r\nurgency and sharpness of the 80's decade in their compositions, but more discreetly. The musical\r\nidentity still needs refining. Anyway, this second opus was welcomed in the desert progressive\r\nlandscape of 1983.<p>A good entry point to discover IQ and the neo-progressive (sub)genre. Also recommended to\r\nearly-GENESIS fans.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1564838#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1564838\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1564838\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, May 15, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1564838)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe debut album release from these Neo Prog stalwarts, their signature sound and style are still forming, the band still groping for evenness and consistency. Still, there are some very nice songs here--definitely nothing \"poor\" or too disappointing--and even an epic (\"The Enemy Smacks\") reaching the heights necessary to crack the halls of Prog Valhalla (it may be even better than some of the soggy epics they've released in the 21st Century!). <p>1. \"The Last Human Gateway\" (19:57) (31/40) 2. \"Through The Corridors\" (2:35) a faster paced song driven by some serious ALEX LIFESON/STEVE HACKETT-like guitar. (4.5/5) 3. \"Awake And Nervous\" (7:45) opens sounding like an organ and Arp Christmas ditty before the band joins in with some intricately woven drum, bass and guitar work. It threatens to sink into an ABACAB abyss before switching directions into a bit of a blatant Gabriel-era GENESIS imitation. Nice drumming. Peter Nicholls as a Peter Gabriel imitator? Who knew? (12.75/15) 4. \"My Baby Treats Me Right \u00b4Cos I\u00b4m A Hard Lovin\u00b4 Man All Night Long\" (1:45) electric piano solo by Martin Orford. Kind of classical. Trying to go super fast. (4/5) 5. \"The Enemy Smacks\" (13:49) a solid multi-movement epic more bombastic but perhaps more infused with YES than the Marillion stuff coming out near the same time. Martin Orford was really good!

Along with \r\nMarillion's first, 'Tales From The Lush Attic' by IQ represents the birth of the neo-progressive movement. During \r\nmost of the record one can almost imagine all band members thinking about how to recreate the vibe of Genesis' \r\n'The Lamb Dies Down on Broadway'. Singer Peter Nicholls hasn't really found his own voice here, but does a nice \r\nenough tribute to Peter Gabriel. The Genesis hommage doesn't bother me much, the production of the record is \r\nthe main problem here. I'm sad to say the band itself is at least partly to blame here; all the tempo's on this \r\nalbum are dead wrong; too fast and distorted by over-excited or rushed playing. The production sound doesn't \r\nhelp either. Probably due a lack of imagination of the producer chose an almost working-man post-punk type of \r\ndry sound, which gives this otherwise imaginative music a very odd 'pub' feel. <p>Putting all these critiques aside, this albums isn't loved for no reason. Right from the opening keyboard theme \r\nfrom 'The Last Human Gateway' you can hear the love for the progressive genre. When Nicholls enters with his \r\ntheatrical performance this moment can still be relived as a sort of reunion of seventies sentiments. This twenty \r\nminute suite unapologetically fires all that was good about symphonic prog; waves of synths, time-signatures, \r\nepic guitar leads and of course that conclusive finale in which everything comes together. On side two 'The \r\nEnemy Smacks' reaches equal peaks. The short 'Through The Corridors' has guitar solo's serving as riffs and \r\nsuffers terribly for it. To bad, because without it side one would have been better.<p>Whether you'll really appreciate this album will depend on you having forgiving ears (or not) when it comes to the \r\nproduction. Its historical importance can't be denied - as does the love put into writing it. The artwork is quite good! Only the \r\nlimited first run has the blue frame and you're more likely to find a red one. The band has also released a remix/remaster which sounds a lot better than my vinyl. I myself will however remain a frequent listener of their more recent output. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2382548#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2382548\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2382548\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, May 16, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2382548)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nPouring through the back catalogue of IQ during \r\nisolation is very therapeutic, the music is so uplifting and \r\npassionate. This debut is all killer, no filler and for a \r\ndebut its absolutely outstanding on every lever. Peter \r\nNicholls voice is dynamic and the musicianship is \r\nmasterful. Tales from the lush Attic is a Neo classic, \r\nreleased the same year as Marillions best album Script \r\nfor a Jesters Tear, can you see how ironic that is. The IQ \r\nalbums to follow in the 80s were nowhere near this \r\ncomplex and accomplished.<p>Both Marillion and IQ demonstrate strong influences of \r\nGenesis and at times Nicholls channels Gabriels \r\ninimitable style it can be said. However IQ stand alone as \r\ndefinitive prog masters, one listen to the 20 minute epic \r\nThe Last Human Gateway will be evidence. What an \r\nincredible magnum opus and still being played in recent \r\nconcerts in its entirety. It even has a 7/8 time signature \r\nin one section circa Apocalypse style, and bookends with \r\nlush keyboards and fragmented drums in its odd time \r\nsignature. <p>The other tracks are an odd assortment including a \r\npiano solo and heavy guitars in the glorious Awake and \r\nNervous. The last track The Enemy Smacks is a \r\nmasterpiece with a wild, abandonment of guitars, keys \r\nand time sigs.  <p>So unexpectantly I find myself giving the very first IQ \r\nrelease 4 stars. They are simply one of the greatest prog \r\nbands out there, make no mistake.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2755643#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2755643\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2755643\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, May 21, 2022</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2755643)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=69885\"><strong>Hector Enrique</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=69885\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/69885/tool_ojo.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAt a time when the predominance of trends such as new wave and more digestible pop were giving the progressive \r\nmovement more than sour moments and even two of its most important representatives, Genesis (resolutely \r\nturning to new sounds) and Yes (looking for a formula for subsistence) were moving away from the recognisable \r\ncanons, proud squires of the genre emerged to inject a breath of vitality and renewed vigour into it. One of them \r\nwas IQ. With almost no budget and taking advantage of an offer from Major Record Company to record and \r\nproduce 1,000 LPs in five days for 1,500 pounds at the time, the Englishmen released \"Tales from the Lush Attic\", \r\ntheir debut album, in the second half of 1983.<p>\r\nThe huge suite \"The Last Human Gateway\" kicks off the album with a theme related to the recurring human quest \r\nfor immortality and the tragic contradiction of not being able to bring closure to the cycle of life, with a prolonged \r\nand suspenseful introduction dominated by the keyboards of Martin Orford and the sublime singing of Peter \r\nNicholls until the irruption of the clean and persistent sounds of the moog, to then go back and forth through \r\nmoments of calm and agitation that towards the end intensify with the participation of the riffs and guitar solos of \r\nMike Holmes and the active drums of Paul Cook, closing the piece epically. One of the album's best.<p>\r\nAnd both the agitated and disturbing \"Through the Corridors\" and the instrumental \"My Baby Treats Me Right 'Cos \r\nI'm a Hard Lovin' Man All Night Long\" with Orford's rushing classical piano solo, both brief interludes interspersed, \r\nprecede the Genesian (Gabriel era) \"Awake and Nervous\" and the multiform \"The Enemy Smacks\", a suite that \r\nwithout reaching the mileage of \"The Last Human Gateway\", describes the deterioration of a heroin addict in three \r\nphases with an instrumentation that adds to the identifiable progressive elements, bluesy touches, hardened hard \r\nrock riffs and lysergic atmospheres reminiscent of the 70's, with a solid base built by Tim Esau's bass and Cook's \r\nintensity on drums until the conclusive ending with the full band. <p>\r\n\"Tales from the Lush Attic\" is a very good album and an unbeatable start for IQ, a precursor band of neo-prog that, \r\nwith few exceptions, has been consistent throughout their career, respecting their original roots.<p>\r\n4 stars<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3034831#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3034831\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3034831\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, April 3, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=608#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3034831)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=56081\"><strong>VianaProghead</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=56081\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/1/cover_404762112008.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" title=\"VianaProghead avatar\" width=100 alt=\"VianaProghead avatar\" onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n                                    Review N\u00ba 820<p>By the early of the 80's, the prog rock was practically dead, showing signs of exhaustion. The big bands were in \r\ncrisis, some coming to an end, others changing their style. In 1981, two friends who were part of the recently \r\nextinct band The Lens decided to move forward in music, and leave for another project, Mike Holmes and Martin \r\nOrford. They recruited Mark Ridout and Tim Esau and formed IQ. Over time, a certain Genesis influence took \r\nover the band. In the beginning, the themes were basically instrumentals. The vocals, when there were, were in \r\ncharge of Martin. But everyone thought the band needed a singer with a stronger voice. They ended up finding \r\nin an old acquaintance the singer they were looking for, Peter Nicholls a friend of Martin and Mike that was part \r\nof Lens for a while. Just over a month after Peter joined, Mark left the group, being replaced by Paul Cook. With a \r\nstable line up, the band made their first work \"Seven Stories Into Eight\". In 1983, they released their real debut \r\nalbum \"Tales From The Lush Attic\", which was well received.<p>So, \"Tales From The Lush Attic\" is the debut studio album of IQ and that was released in 1983. The line up on the \r\nalbum is Peter Nicholls (vocals), Mike Holmes (acoustic, electric and twelve-string guitars), Martin Orford \r\n(keyboards, synthesizer and Mellotron), Tim Esau (bass guitar) and Paul Cook (drums and percussion).<p>For those who love Marillion in Fish's era, this is a must have album in your collection. If you haven't heard IQ, \r\nthen know that, though IQ is unique in many ways, the impression is that \"Tales From The Lush Attic\" has a \r\nsprinkling of Genesis' \"Selling England By The Pound\" with a modern edge like Marillion produced at the time. \r\nThe big difference between the two was that Marillion often didn't demonstrate their technical skills in the first \r\nplace. The songs, the lyrics, and the overall compositions came first. But the IQ's approach has always been a bit \r\nmore to the other side. Holmes is technically a brilliant guitarist and his solos and fills are unique and very \r\naggressive. Orford contributed with major keyboard solos and runs while also attending to Mellotrons and \"lush\" \r\nkey orchestrations. Esau's bass pulses with energy in counter point with drummer Cook playing with speed and \r\nenergy more in the style of Keith Moon. Leading is Nicholls who wrote all the lyrics and has, like in Marillion's \r\nFish, a whimsical vocal style of Peter Gabriel in Genesis.<p>\"Tales From The Lush Attic\" has five tracks. All tracks were written by IQ. The first track \"The Last Human \r\nGateway\" is over 20 minutes and was the entire side one of the original vinyl release. In the best tradition of \r\nMarillion, this title proposes three main sections, with multiple themes linked to each other. It's a great suite of \r\nvarying moods with an absolutely haunting melody, with neat arrangements and where the balance between \r\nthe different instruments and the vocal parts accentuates the pleasure distilled by the catchy melodies. For me, \r\nit's one of the defining songs of the genre and by itself it worth the price of this set alone. The second track \r\n\"Through The Corridors\" is a small and fast speed rocker with guitar and keyboards constantly exchanging runs \r\non fast forward. This is a pleasant little tune. The third track \"Awake And Nervous\" carries on with the pace with \r\nOrford demonstrating once again why he is still one of the best keyboardists in prog nowadays. The track \r\nfeatures the usual IQ trademark with the rhythm section playing a time signature that defies your expectations \r\nwhile the main melody carries on clever and catching. This is another great track. The fourth track \"My Baby \r\nTreats Me Right 'Cos I'm A Hard Lovin' Man All Night Long\" is very short, a beautiful fast paced classical piano \r\npiece that pulls you away from the previous tracks. It serves as a refreshing respite. The fifth track \"The Enemy \r\nSmacks\" remains one of the band's major standards today. It brings you back to something in the area of \r\nGenesis. But, despite the track often evokes Genesis, these are only reminiscences and not plagiarism. It's a \r\ncombination of a very aggressive hard rock with symphonic progressive which happens to contains some of \r\ntheir most complex moments on the album. This is another fan favourite that still finds its way into the IQ live \r\nset even in our days.<p>Conclusion: IQ is often overlooked but is a band that historically deserves co-credit along with better known \r\nMarillion for stubbornly keeping the progressive rock door opened during the early 80's. Both bands would \r\nrelease their debut albums in 1983. However, unlike the more commercially successful of \"Script For A Jester's \r\nTear\" of Marillion, IQ's own offering \"Tales From The Lush Attic\". Maybe not as good as Marillion's work, IQ \r\npresents another great proposal, an earthier and grittier side to progressive rock. \"Tales From The Lush Attic\" is \r\nan album that offers a balanced portion of hurried guitar and enveloping keyboards. Specks of prog era Genesis \r\nglisten with every note sung by lead singer Peter Nicholls, who sounds like Gabriel. Even the structure of some of \r\nthe songs resembles bits of \"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\". But, there's a real air on this album that \r\ngathers our attention, especially on the synth and Mellotron ridden passages. So, \"Tales From the Lush Attic\" is a \r\ngreat debut album of one of the best and most consistent prog bands.<p>Prog is my Ferrari.
