style=\"padding-left:10px;margin:0;border-left: solid 5px #f0f0f0;\">\r\n\r\n<strong>Marc Carlton biography</strong><br />\r\nMarc CARLTON is a UK-based musician/composer, focusing on a unique brand of experimental instrumental music, mixing progressive rock, electronic and symphonic sounds to create highly involving and emotional experiences. Heavily influenced by the 70's progressive era, he cites primary inspiration from the work of KING CRIMSON, GENESIS, Mike OLDFIELD and YES, tempered by a love of ambient music by the likes of TANGERINE DREAM and Jean-Michel JARRE, and also modern Japanese game music by Nobuo UEMATSU and Yasunori MITSUDA. However, CARLTON's mournful instrumentals, often minimalist soundscapes, and truly unmistakable guitar sound make his work very much a new chapter in progressive music, attempting to capture the breadth and spirit of the 70s golden age in a modern, essential form. <br><br>His first work - 1998's \"Passing Within Realtime\" - mainly featured complex, extended acoustic guitar movements, piano, and synth in a gentle style comparable to the early work of Anthony PHILLIPS, \"reflections on awakening, waiting, indecision, determination, corruption, and freedom\". Slowly, CARLTON's singlehanded album production has evolved into more lush arrangements and a more electric sound, ultimately typified by 2004's mesmerising \"Still\", and \"Reflex Arc\" in 2005 - a sixteen-part continuous suite aiming to depict various states of direct experience. <br><br>An artist who, in the words written by Steve HACKETT that got him into GENESIS, seeks to \"strive beyond existing stagnant music forms\", Marc CARLTON's work will prove interesting for anyone who takes the time for music to speak to them, challenge them, and immerse them in a sonic journey through the mind. <br><br>Submitted by Marc Carlton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:left;padding:0px;margin:10px 0px 10px 0px;\">\r\n<!-- ads here-->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div

border=\"0\">\r\n\"Winter Diary\" is the 10th album by multi-instrumentalist Marc Carlton. I say 10th album, but interestingly on \r\nhis website this album comes under special projects rather than albums.  The other special projects listed \r\nappear to be soundtracks but this album as he describes on the website as a mixture of old, re-recorded \r\npieces and fresh new music.  I personally would class it as an album which is why I've called it his 10th album \r\nbecause he has created something new here and with the new pieces it does bring about a different jigsaw.  <p> Marc also describes this as his simplest works since \"Voices through endless walls\" which was his second \r\nalbum.  Although I have the first 3 albums, I haven't given them a proper listen yet. Unlike his albums \r\nbetween, his 4th album \"Still\" right up until this album \"Winter Diary\" which came out last year where I have \r\nnow reviewed all the albums from \"Still\" onwards.  But anyway onto \"Winter Diary\". Why does Carlton \r\ndescribe this as simple?  Well, if you have listened to Carlton's work over the years, he generally mixes \r\nbetween different instruments including guitars (acoustic and electric), mellotrons, piano, keyboards and even \r\nbongos.  But in \"Winter Diary\" the star of the show and what the album is centred around is the acoustic \r\nguitar. You will find on most tracks he uses 2 acoustic guitars giving the pieces depth as they act as layers.  \r\nThat's not to say other instruments don't appear on the album as piano, mellotron and synthesiser do appear \r\nin places. <p>It might be synths that start off the album but I'm not 100% but I do know it's a wind type effect which flows \r\nthrough the first track really adding to the concept of the album which I imagine to be a cold winter's day with \r\na cold breeze flowing through the air.  It sets the tone and the imagery for the album well.  This is also how \r\nthe album finishes giving the album closure.  One thing which amazes me about Carlton is his ability to \r\nchange moods and feelings of a track using just an acoustic guitar. This can be within tracks and tracks 8, \"Ask \r\nme\" and particularly track 10 \"The eyes of all ways\" are prime examples of this.  These tracks are good on face \r\nvalue, but I feel sometimes you can appreciate them even more if you just let your imagination run wild and \r\nreally allow the music in and to make up your own story about the music.  <p> Marc almost nudges you in the direction for this album of thinking about being out for a walk on a cold \r\nwinters day and the elements being unpredictable and ever changing. For most of the album it is quite a \r\npleasant walk and Marc does this by playing the acoustic guitar in a gentle plucking way giving you a warm \r\nfeeling of the sun being out but going through the snow.  But through the darker passages Marc uses more \r\naggressive strumming which to me reflects the storms you are going through on the walk.  I would say my \r\nfavourite piece on the album is \"Clay trees\" really as you might have guessed it for the guitar work is \r\nparticularly to my tastes.  But I feel over the 11 tracks, having not listened to the original tracks were re-\r\nrecorded for this album everything seems to fit together nicely.<p> I saw an interview recently with prog legend Steven Wilson who said he looks at his guitar now and thinks he \r\nhas completed it and does not really know where else to go with it.  Well Steven you should listen to \"Winter \r\nDiary\" and be well and truly amazed because this is a master class of what can be done with an acoustic \r\nguitar.  Once again Carlton has shown just how talented he is, there is a few storms to navigate but what is the \r\nfun in everything being plain sailing. It keeps it interesting and is such a nice listen.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2534960#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2534960\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2534960\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, April 13, 2021</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=71198#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2534960)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=50897\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_4024151092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" Degrees Of Freedom by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2015<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"5.00 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">5.00</span> | 1 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=50897#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=50897\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Degrees Of Freedom</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=6440\"><strong>The Rain Man</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Prog Reviewer</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:'#dc143c';text-align: center;font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:5px;\">&mdash; First review of this album &mdash;</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=6440\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/scene_sunovermountains.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"Degrees of Freedom\" is the ninth studio album by Scottish based artist Marc Carlton.  Released in 2015, \r\n\"Degrees of Freedom\" is the follow up to 2012s \"For Imagination\".  That album I felt Marc was really pushing \r\nhis own boundaries both in terms of length and complexity of the songs. While it is purely instrumental music \r\nMarc produces, it is difficult to pigeon whole Marc in a category or genre due to the range of instruments he \r\nuses on albums and the clear range of influences which can be found throughout his music.<p>I think \"Degrees of Freedom\" is a great name for this album and I love what Marc said on his website when \r\ndescribing the album - \"this album is my attempt to have the best musical adventure possible on rails. Free to \r\nexplore rhythm, melody and instrumentation, part of the approach was to break rules - particularly my own - \r\nand resist simplification.\"  For me, this really sums up the album so well. For someone who had 8 albums out \r\nup to this point; many artists often go down the route of replicating formulas which have worked for them \r\nand proved successful. But Marc is not like that. He keeps pushing his own boundaries.<p>What I notice about this album compared to some of his previous works is that to me the tracks on the album \r\nfeel more self-contained, rather than one longer piece broken into sections.  There are still longer tracks on \r\nhere with a couple sitting at around 11 minutes and one 10 minutes, but this is mixed in with shorter tracks \r\ntoo.  Carlton continues to bounce between guitars and synths and often the tracks are multi-layered while \r\nothers one instrument is more prominent.  I think this where solo artists and particularly Marc has an \r\nadvantage in terms of creativity over bands.  In bands everyone wants a role in each song which I think can \r\noften limit creative output. I am not saying this is the case for all bands but for a lot.  Whereas having a multi-\r\ninstrumentalist like Marc there can be different focuses from different instruments on different tracks and \r\nthere are no arguments with someone saying \"I don't appear on half the album because my instrument is not \r\ninvolved\"<p>I do like this album a lot. The journeys Marc takes you on, on each of his albums, is not only different each \r\ntime but it is different to really what is out there now. When you think of bands doing instrumental albums \r\nout there now, there is the likes of Mogwai and Explosions in the sky.  These bands, while great bands, they \r\nalways seem to go for the quite/loud approach and try to create that wall of noise as I like to call it each time.  \r\nIt is like hikers wanting to climb the highest peak in their country each time.  But the thing is you do not always \r\nneed to climb that hill to find adventure and beauty.  It can be a walk round a lake or through a forest.  And \r\nfor me that analogy reflects Marc's music the best, especially with this album. There are a lot of twists and \r\nturns along the way. In fact, when I listen to this, I often turn to my CD player and think to myself - this is \r\namazing.  Then I would listen further, and it would happen again.  For example, the fantastic piano playing \r\nduring track 6 \"Neutral karma due to admin error\" or the electric guitar parts in track 3 \"Degrees of freedom\".  \r\nThe album is littered with magical moments.<p>But there is one track on this album where I think Marc really has excelled himself and that really is saying a \r\nlot as I rate his music extremely highly and that is track 10 \"Persmerga Finds Yurba\".  The rhythmic drumming \r\ncombined with the electric guitar to start off with is bliss.  The type of drumming Carlton is doing here is like \r\nnothing I have ever heard on an album by him before, I'm not sure exactly what type of drum it is, maybe \r\nbongos of some form.  But you can see this is what he is talking about when he is giving himself that freedom \r\nto experiment and this is an explementary example of this.  One in which he has pulled off with effortless \r\nease.  And that is just the start of the track.  This is a 11-minute rollercoaster which after 5 minutes breakdown \r\ninto a more electronic synth-based vibe, which then moves on to a section which has a dramatic organ like \r\neffect before returning to the milder synths to finish.<p>Overall, this really is an excellent album.  In so many ways Marc has pushed himself and the results are there \r\nfor your ears to hear.   This is one of my favourites by him because I think there is just so much to it, it is \r\nalways off going in different directions which keeps it interesting. He is continually experimenting with new \r\nsounds and instruments while his talent for using the instruments he has used previously still shines through.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2509357#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2509357\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2509357\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, February 27, 2021</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=50897#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2509357)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=38580\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_1521151092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" For Imagination by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2012<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.29 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.29</span> | 3 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=38580#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=38580\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">For Imagination</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=6440\"><strong>The Rain Man</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Prog Reviewer</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=6440\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/scene_sunovermountains.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"For Imagination\" is the 8th album by prog, experimental, purely instrumental artist, Marc Carlton.  This album \r\nwas released back in 2012 and sees Carlton explore more musical avenues as he pushes the boundaries \r\nfurther in this compisition.  Like his other records Carlton plays all instruments on this album as well as \r\nproducing it.<p>The structure of this album is quite intriguing.  It is essentially 3 long tracks. And when I say long, I mean long \r\nwith track 1 \"Cityscape\" - 25 minutes, track 2 \"Someniare Aude, Sapere Aude\" - 20 minutes and track 3 \r\n\"Outward\" - 28 minutes.  But within these tracks there are a lot of ideas going on and you can see why Carlton \r\nsplit them into different parts.  As often within these tracks they go off in all sorts of directions.  This stops \r\nrepetition and keeps drawing the listener in.  But at the same time the parts are connected within each track \r\ngiving flow. Track 1 is 8 parts, track 2, 6 parts and track 3, 4 parts. So it could have been a 17 track album but \r\nthat would ignore the fact that the different parts within each track flow into each other.  Just talking about \r\nthis makes me realise that for a lot of albums this isn't a talking point because it doesn't happen on the \r\nmajority of albums I listen to.  This is a testament to the amount of thought and time Carlton spends \r\nconnecting all of the pieces of this amazing jigsaw together in such a long piece of music.<p>The heaviest point of the album comes in track 1 - \"Cityscape\" between part 5 - \"Heavy metal poisoning \r\n(including Antidote)\". This is appropriatley titled as it is the hard rock section of the album and sounds \r\namazing. A real highlight for me. I wish it would last longer this part but perhaps the shortness of it makes it \r\nmore special. Its quite an interesting transition between this part and the next bit of the track which is part 6 - \r\n\"Trivia-blinded\". As it goes from a heavy hard rock part to quite a tranquil melodic part. I almost see it like \r\nmountain biking on a ridge high up in the mountains and the transition representing the downhill to the more \r\ntranquil easy biking. The transition is like a steep downhill and you have to pump the brakes from making you \r\ngo too fast and fall off. It does feel slightly out of control but you just about stay on the bike and are now into \r\nthe relaxing easy cycling. <p>The 3rd track \"Outward\" sits at 28 minutes long and I think is the most adventurous track I have heard of \r\nCarlton's. At points you feel there is not a lot going on and it takes a while between ideas. There is no \r\nexplosions of sound of anything that really leaps out I would say. The ideas and the flow of the track I would \r\nsay are quite subtle. If you are the kind of person that gets frustrated when a bus is 10 minutes late I don't \r\nthink you would like this as you need to be patient and have an attentive ear to appreciate it. While being long \r\nI wouldn't say you need to really take 20 listens to get it. I think even on first listen you can get to grips with it \r\nbut as I say you do need to be patient.  The first two tracks, \"Cityscape\" and \"Someniare Aude, Sapere Aude\" \r\nare quite contrasting to \"Outward\".  There is a lot more going on in these tracks at all times as Carlton mixes \r\nbetween guitar and synths. The changes of direction happen quicker while still letting the ideas of each part \r\nflourish.  \"Outward\" on the other hand is more synth based and is like one long, dreamy, atmospheric outro.  <p>Overall this is not an album you will be blasting full volume in your car or even generally if you are out and \r\nabout.  I think it really requires you to be somewhere with no other interferring sounds when playing this.  \r\nThat way you can fully discover the complexity and it will allow you to be taken on a journey that you can full \r\nappreciate this way.<p>There is a blurb in the inside sleave of the CD of this album with the last sentence saying \"While the process of \r\ntruth is the authority I live by, it is imagination that I live for\".  This really does sum up what Carlton is about.  \r\nThe way he keeps stretching himself and comes up with new ideas. Everyone has an imagination but few use \r\nit and implement the ideas in a way that Carlton does.  And that is what makes \"For Imagination\" so special.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2496705#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2496705\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2496705\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, January 24, 2021</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=38580#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2496705)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=9413\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_4045141092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" Voices Through Endless Walls by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 1999<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.73 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.73</span> | 2 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=9413#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=9413\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Voices Through Endless Walls</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25305\"><strong>simbelmyne</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn the 20 years since Voices Through Endless Walls, Marc Carlton's work has grown more technologically accomplished, and listeners to more recent offerings will be familiar with a very different sound, and a more lush and varied instrumentation. This is far more stripped back, you will hear more extended acoustic guitar parts, you WILL hear tape hiss. <p>However, going back two decades is far from a disappointment - the comparison actually makes the raw ambition of this early work all the more clear.<p>The album has an unforgiving but rewarding format of four twenty-plus minute pieces, each of which is a longform reflection, offering space to explore something intensely personal, idiosyncratic and yet powerfully relatable. Each piece is allowed to breathe and develop and the result is something both varied in scope and richly detailed.<p>'Our Cries Made Clear' is by far the most accessible track on the album, and right from my first listen the best part of two decades ago it was a key that helped me to see the thinking behind Carlton's music. More than that, it opened my eyes to just how much instrumental music can actually say. Opening with an organ sound that builds and layers until it is replaced by introspective piano and guitar, each new part builds on the ideas of the last and the pacing feels gentle and natural, clearly telling a story. The main guitar theme starting from eight minutes in sets out its initially tentative thesis, an idea that is then nurtured, growing in enthusiasm and joy until something seems to go awry. This is responded to by a slightly manic, increasingly frantic distorted guitar, leaving a real gut punch when it eventually breaks down. It is a journey through inspiration, hope, attempted understanding and grief. Through this Carlton explores what it is to be a mind in contact with an external world that can't always understand you, with all the risks, joys and disappointments this entails. The hairs still stand up on the back of my neck every time I hear the percussion come in, grounding and cocooning the return of the now familiar main guitar theme as it reasserts and consolidates itself, indeed making its cry clear in the most touching way. The rest of the track is recovery, strengthening. We can take joy in what we are, even if this is not shared by others. <p>The opening of 'The Fragile Shade' in comparison feels more atmospheric than narrative. Carlton creates a haunting aural landscape of guitars that feels like a peaceful but unstable reprieve after the tribulations of 'Our Cries...' and takes his time developing it. Ideas form and come together in the interplay of guitar sounds but swim in and out of focus like turning a kaleidoscope and in these shifting sands Carlton seems to be saying that solace isn't always restful or easy. When one idea does eventually take centre stage just before nine minutes it is sad and beautiful before shifting into a calm meditation on itself in the last five minutes, a story told by intricate acoustic guitar rising and falling, at times with the regularity of breath but always developing and changing.<p>And then... 'Tree of Poisons'. Oh man. This is an abrupt shift, with everything from the very first note heralding the sheer dread that is to come. Do you want to hear the soundtrack to an anxiety attack? You can't go far wrong with this. The opening section is very disorienting, with hazy, distorted guitar, bits of weird synths that sound like they're backwards, and loads of discordant abstract stuff going on. After four minutes the chaos abruptly stops - for a while - to be replaced with very orderly and minimal guitar, a contrast which only adds to the tension, like being frozen in a moment of dread. It gradually becomes softer and more mournful but reasserts itself several more times before being subsumed. It's hard to adequately describe the sheer power and character of the swirling wall of distorted sounds in the middle section. It's pure focused dread and self doubt and horror that chews you up and shreds your soul. It's definitely a taste that takes a while to acquire, think Fripp's Gates of Paradise. Took me the longest time to feel the love for this one but now I feel it deeply and it has firmly become one of the highlights of the album for me. Eventually the chaos does calm, and there is a more traditionally melodic section of recovery, though right at the end that swirl of distortion starts to rise again, as if to signal that this is one battle that's never really over.<p>'Resonance' starts with a guitar melody that quickly gathers pace and confidence, interspersing moments of joy with moments of reflection. There is a real sense of motion with the music signalling its own breakdown before recovering over and over. Carlton deftly reminds us that such motion brings both the development of new ideas, and inevitably, reflection and loss. Later, an intricate and discomforting piano section builds the sense of halting motion and reflection with alternating speed and silence, and sound allowed to build up then rapidly curtailed. Like reaching out for something but never quite touching it, it speaks of the never ending tension of restraint and freedom and as a result is tinged with sadness. Before you know it, the final guitar section wraps up the track and the album and the almost 90 minute journey is over.<p>Throughout Voices Through Endless Walls, Carlton stretched the tools he had to take us on four very different musical explorations. By turns delicately thoughtful, moving and downright intense, what shines through each of the four corners of the album is the intricacy and intimacy with which Carlton explores all of his ideas. This sense is palpable and it doesn't let you go, asking you to listen again, to ponder more. After years and years of listening Voices is still unfolding itself to me and that speaks to how much of value is in here and how much it deserves to be heard. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2250318#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2250318\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2250318\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 9, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=9413#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2250318)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=38580\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_1521151092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" For Imagination by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2012<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.29 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.29</span> | 3 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=38580#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=38580\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">For Imagination</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25305\"><strong>simbelmyne</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n'For Imagination' is by far Marc Carlton's most abstract work. There are three tracks, all over 20\r\nmins long, each split into subsections for which we are not given the time references. Combine this\r\nwith progressively more 'far-out' themes and instrumentation over the course of the album and you\r\nbegin to understand the demands this work places on the listener. Each track is a reflection on\r\nimagination and the inner life in a different dimension, with only the smallest crumbs of guidance\r\ngiven along the way. Here's what I've come to think over the past 4+ years...<p>The theme that draws together the first track, 'Cityscape', is imagination in the context of our\r\neveryday lives. Is the inner life of the mind compatible with our existence in a world that can\r\noften seek to distract us from it? This is seen in the sense of juxtaposition throughout the track,\r\nthe interplay between synths and guitars an early example of this as a tight synthesiser rhythm\r\nsounds clean and sharp in contrast to the grungy electric guitar that meanders around it. The\r\ncentral question is also examined in another way. The track is peppered throughout with the sounds\r\nof human habitation: drills; traffic; chatter; to which the music then 'reacts' in various ways.\r\nThis is the story of one mind's journey through the crowd, trying to come to terms with the reality\r\nand absurdity of other minds and of one's separateness from them. <p>At about 7:00, jarring, industrial sounding percussive clanks and bass notes create an uneasy\r\nrhythm, always shifting and unpredictable. Out of this grows something that touches the ethereal:\r\nthe slow rise of the synthesiser here at once eerie and beautiful, it doesn't take over from the\r\nearlier rhythm but instead sits alongside it, transmuting it, like trespassing into something\r\nancient and mysterious.<p>Something that must be mentioned is that after another brief quiet around 10:30, the sound of drills\r\nand building work unpleasantly cut through, heralding a brief heavy metal pastiche(!) It's\r\nbittersweet comic relief, as just as it gets going it abruptly breaks down to a commentary from the\r\nbackground of 'Argh!' Is it a comment on the kind of music we 'expect' to grow out of a bit of\r\nindustrial drilling, as a failure of imagination? Or a reflection that not every fleeting idea that\r\ncomes to mind can be successfully realised? I can't say, but I can tell you this is Carlton as his\r\nmost obviously playful and tongue in cheek, and well worth longer consideration than the quick laugh\r\nof the comedy itself. <p>Around 13:00 chatter in the background and 'lounge music'-esque electric guitar evoke maybe a\r\nrestaurant scene. The guitar becomes more and more meandering and then falls away, as if it can't\r\nmaintain the melody it began.  The section that follows and seems to be in opposition to this is\r\nfabulous, the guitar solo resolute and full of energy. Drums and harpsichord come in and refocus,\r\nreaffirm the theme. It carries you away with it until all of a sudden around the 18 minute mark it\r\nabruptly stops, leaving you with the sound of traffic and footsteps, and coming back to earth with a\r\nbump. <p>After this a sombre synth reflects as if trying to reconcile the two worlds. One note repeats, buzzy\r\nand insistent in the mix, reminiscent of a heartbeat or maybe the ringing of a telephone. Around it\r\nan eerie melody unfolds, interspersed with the occasional jarring piano notes to add to the tension\r\nand dread. When this resolves into rain and four last bells it is with a mixture of relief and\r\ntrepidation. This serves to enhance the joy of the final section, the synth here dancing around the\r\nbass notes which gradually take over to tell a story of their own, grounding and accepting. The\r\ntrack does not end but rather fades out, signalling no ultimate conclusion or final twist but rather\r\nthe continuation of the intercourse between the two things, imagination and reality. Carlton's liner\r\nnotes indicate that although he views the separation of imagination from reality as important, \"it\r\nis possible to live in both of these worlds simultaneously and without overlap.\" I think that is the\r\nidea at play here.<p>The second track, 'Somniare Aude, Sapere Aude' makes me think of imagination in its purest form, the\r\nunrestricted world of our dreams, not only from the title but also because the opening section\r\nreminds me so much of a lullaby. Perhaps in contrast to the previous track, the acoustic guitar and\r\nstrings are so gentle and uncontested the sound is like the purest flight of unlimited fancy. The\r\npiano and pensively strummed guitar section at around 3 minutes in is reminiscent of Carlton's\r\nearlier album, 'Reflex Arc', and this is a comparison that recurs throughout the track, both in the\r\ninstrumentation and in the way that one melody shifts dreamlike into the next. Brief moments of\r\ndarkness, first introduced around the 9 minute mark, come not from external forces like in\r\n'Cityscape' but instead organically unfold, signalling the power of imagination and the mind to take\r\nus to places of doubt and hesitation as easily as to those of wonder, and recalls the non-linear and\r\nsurprising narratives of our dreams. Although the track is mostly gentle in tone there is plenty of\r\nenergy within it, as can be seen around 13:38 when the drums come in and start a section full of\r\nmotion and excitement. At first dreamy strings and piano take a back seat to the drums but\r\nincreasingly begin to carry the story themselves. Later, there is a great back-and-forth between\r\ndistorted guitar and the more gentle melody, with the latter then echoed by faint synths at 16:50 in\r\na way that will put the hairs on the back of your neck on end. There is a real sense of synthesis\r\nbetween the more gentle sounds and the distorted elements, although they structurally seem to be in\r\nopposition they end up complementing each other, as if to say: our minds contain multitudes, but\r\nthere is no real contradiction, they are all us. For me the final few incongruous notes once again\r\nrecall a lullaby or child's musical box, pulling the various threads of the piece together.<p>After that we are straight into 'Outward' which is certainly the most unfamiliar territory for\r\nprevious listeners of Carlton's work, or indeed previous listeners of music in general. A piece that\r\nowes a lot to both to Tangerine Dream at their most abstract and Robert Fripp's Soundscapes series,\r\nit certainly challenges the listener to look at it closely, and to keep doing so for almost half an\r\nhour! Here, spacey echoey synths evoke both a sense of vastness and a sci-fi feel, in a way that\r\nrecalls the album's cover art. Like Soundscapes, it feels structureless at first but then shapes\r\nbegin to appear in the rising and falling of the sound. This fades to one growly, deep note, growing\r\ngradually louder. Around it other sounds come and go, like huge unknown objects passing in the dark.\r\nThe sounds change in pitch in a way that sounds like sirens or the calling of unknown creatures. (I\r\nmay have been watching too much Star Trek: TNG but it makes me think of the season three episode,\r\nTin Man). The sound is so alien and abstract that I can only describe it in such oblique ways. It's\r\nfascinating that in such a vacuum the ear eagerly grabs onto the first signs of what could become\r\nanything like a melody, so when the new synths grow out of the void at 6:49 they seem to carry all\r\nthe more weight, asking us to reflect on what we've heard. There's something like a sadness to it, a\r\nloneliness, but it's calm - wise. <p>Around 11:40 this fades with a boom and once again we are left with quiet except for a rhythmic,\r\nrepetitive sound that almost seems to be beeping, like a beacon emitting its signal into\r\nnothingness, over and over. More synths growing - impossibly slowly - louder, like the approach of\r\nsomething. A thrumming like engines. It's amazing what the brain projects onto something so minimal.\r\nI have a whole story worked out of a journey through space, approaching a new planet as, so\r\ngradually, the sounds become warmer and more familiar again (eventually there are drums and even\r\nguitar!) but I'm aware it is just that, projection. But that's exactly 'Outward''s fascination - it\r\nmakes you examine that, what you bring of yourself to the music, the power of the listener's\r\nimagination. It's not just for the artists, it's for all of us.<p>If you haven't heard any of Carlton's work, I wouldn't start here. But I wouldn't miss it out\r\neither. For Imagination is unapologetic for what it is, which is music at its most serious, inviting\r\nand important. It toys with the role of listener, it makes no effort to ease the journey. But it's\r\nalso brimming with reward for that effort. It's the essential nature of prog, pared back and\r\nunmitigated. I can't recommend it enough.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1691289#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1691289\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1691289\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, February 10, 2017</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=38580#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1691289)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=22870\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_2616151092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" For Truth by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2009<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.63 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.63</span> | 6 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=22870#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=22870\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">For Truth</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25305\"><strong>simbelmyne</strong></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, this is an album of many layers and much to demand of the\r\nlistener. Although at first glance the set of sounds present makes it superficially similar to the\r\nprevious couple of albums, in terms of density 'For Truth' is a very different beast, sharing more\r\nwith Carlton's early work. There is so much going on in this album that it's taken me a long time to fully feel at ease with it. Despite this, the investment is well worth it-  with moments here\r\nstanding among Carlton's finest and most mature.<p>The title track introduces the album slowly, synths gradually building a reflective atmosphere which the lead guitar decisively cuts through at 3:40 and by the 5 minute mark has an energetic and fresh sound which reminds me somehow of the first track on 'Reflex Arc'. Guitar dances deftly around piano on this track in a scene-setting or laying out of principles for the album to come. At 9:25 particularly, a burst of distorted guitar adds passion and drive to the previously cerebral piano, which could showcase the relevance and intertwining of Carlton's liner note philosophy snippets into everyday life. <p>'One Possible Dream', a feat of primarily acoustic genius at nearly 12 minutes, starts at pace and sounds quite busy with close layers of different guitars. Rising and falling, in full flow and then suddenly hesitant, this is an exquisitely crafted piece that effortlessly sweeps you along in its story throughout. There's lots here that is reminiscent of Carlton's earlier album 'An Ageless\r\nSense' and a favourite moment for me are the high notes in the first half of the seventh minute -\r\nthe epitome of bittersweet.<p>In contrast, the opening strings of 'Ghosts Where Once We Hid' lie thick and heavy on the soul\r\nbefore the atmosphere brightens to make room for sparse guitar to tell its story from 2:15. Another exercise in bittersweet reflection, but one that seems to somehow resolve itself after 5:20, with the remainder of the track very different. It reminds me vaguely of a child's music box being reheard and  remembered fondly as an adult-  a nostalgia of sorts, but not a regretful one.<p>'Intersection Minor' is an obvious pair to the later 'Intersection Major'- both of which successfully help to break up an album otherwise made up of lengthy tracks. Unlike the latter, here the guitar is pensive and incredibly sad, at points seeming to sink into a hopeless and ruminating despair. Continuing this theme, 'Caught in the Fourth Wall' has a fantastic Silent Hill feeling to\r\nit, atmospheric and full of odd percussive elements; it is like being frozen in the dread and horror\r\nof absurdity, feeling half in and half out of touch with the world. The tension here is broken when\r\nits grumblings of discontent and alienation are given voice, made explicit by the entrance of the\r\nlead guitar at 4:38. Quite an unusual sounding track, and a personal favourite.<p>The following track, 'Mindfire', is a tricky one and can seem ass-backwards at first: almost as if\r\nit starts with a conclusion; a confident guitar exhausting and replenishing itself before dealing\r\nwith breakdown and murmuring doubt in the middle section, resolving itself with a burble of building guitars before bursting out and surprising you with a reiteration of its main theme. One of the hardest tracks to get my head around but one which in turn I still feel has more to reveal to me yet after two years of listening.<p>'Return from Fading Landscapes', a turbulent and beautiful piece, starts with a plaintive buzzing\r\nlike a siren call to memory. It's a track of contrasts as sparse and weighty keyboard work is\r\ninterrupted abruptly by the guitar and percussion at 3:30, warming and brightening the whole thing. Full of fragility and gravity throughout, the strings at 5:13 add intensity before a breakdown at 6:04 which leaves keyboards echoing into nothingness. The piercing re-entry of the guitar at 6:50 is a peak of poignancy leaving the rest of the track pondering and consolidating its resolution. <p>The warm acoustic notes of 'Intersection Major' are welcome to the ear at this point, a pastoral and folksy piece with a more traditional structure that is executed with confidence. The following\r\n'Reason or Die' concludes the album with a flourish, the brooding momentum of its percussion and strains of electric guitar reaching a crescendo in its 6th minute before leaving dreamy, pondering synths to end the album as they began it.<p>A few reviewers of Carlton's previous albums have labelled them 'relaxation' music, a judgement I have always felt to be short-sighted, but I particularly defy the reader to listen to this offering\r\nand say the same thing. If you believe that then you are simply not listening. This is extremely\r\ncerebral music absolutely packed full of stuff to ponder. If you want relaxation have a cup of tea\r\nand listen to whale song or something. If, however, what you want is brain food from a skilled and dedicated solo artist, you can't go far wrong with this.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=493151#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=493151\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=493151\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, July 30, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22870#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #493151)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=31040\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_342312102010.jpg\" alt=\" Bridge (with Kate Toft) by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2006<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"3.91 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">3.91</span> | 3 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=31040#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=31040\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Bridge (with Kate Toft)</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Special Collaborator</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Fourth bridge? Fifth really!</strong><p>Marc Carlton is exclusively a solo writer and performer. All his releases to date have been \r\ninstrumental albums on which he has been composer, musician, producer and technician. \r\nIn 2006 however, he collaborated on this album with his partner Kate Toft under the name \r\nBridge. This album thus sits between Carlton's \"Still\" and \"Ofriah\" releases. Uniquely for \r\nthis album in addition to his guitar and keyboards contributions, Carlton also sings. The \r\nlyrics however come from Toft's poetry throughout. Toft is highly talented in her own right, \r\nbeing a poet, singer and multi-instrumentalist. <p>In terms of the musical content, it would be easy to simply describe it as a Marc Carlton \r\nalbum with vocals, for that is essentially what it is. The vocals do though make a big \r\ndifference in terms of accessibility and perhaps commercial appeal. Listening to the \r\nopening \"Origin\", Carlton's voice is reminiscent of Mike Hugg or Mike Batt, being \r\natmospheric rather than operatic. This shorter introductory track is largely reflective, with \r\nsymphonic string synth backing the main vocal.<p>\"Theatre rain\" sees us gently drifting in to a more upbeat light instrumental with musical \r\nbox type keyboards. This serves as an introduction to the longest track on the album, the \r\n10+ minute \"Wave to me\". Here we come upon the delicate tones of Kate Toft's vocals for \r\nthe first time. Her voice is similar in tone to the likes of Joni Mitchell and Judy Collins, the \r\nsparse arrangement here placing her vocals well to the fore. The track has something of a \r\nfolk feel to it, with acoustic guitar dominating instrumentally. <p>\"Impasse\" returns us to the ambient instrumental moods which prevail in much of Carlton's \r\nwork, synth being the main instrument of choice. The track segues seamlessly into \"No \r\ntime\", where Toft returns with a more orthodox melodic song. This 7 minute piece gradually \r\nbuilds and develops throughout, while retaining a largely straightforward melody.<p>At about 9\u00bd minutes, \"Colour\" is the second of the <em>feature</em> tracks on the album. \r\nInitially, this piece is one of Marc's most abstract numbers, with Floydian lead guitar played \r\nover waves of ambient sound. \"Alliances\" is a stripped back solo piece by Carlton, featuring \r\nonly his dulcet tones and acoustic guitar. The song is Tim Buckley like in its inherent \r\nsimplicity. <p>Marc moves to piano for the barely audible fragility that is \"Spent\", a beautifully reflective \r\nsolo. The song \"My last breath\" comes from Marc's \"Far tide\" project, the acoustic version \r\nhere consisting simply of acoustic guitar plus vocals by Kate Toft. The album concludes \r\nwith the brief \"Kokoromachi\", a further acoustic piece with soft vocalising by Toft.<p>While this may not strictly speaking be a part of Marc Carlton's solo discography, \"Bridge\" is \r\nan important component of his output. Here he offers a unique opportunity to enjoy his \r\nmusic complemented by vocals. Those vocal are far from intrusive, and the album remains  \r\nlargely instrumental. Those who have discovered Carlton's albums such as \"Still\" \r\nand \"Reflex arc\" will also find this album rewarding.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=303543#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=303543\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=303543\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 12, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=31040#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #303543)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=22870\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_2616151092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" For Truth by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2009<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"4.63 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">4.63</span> | 6 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=22870#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=22870\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">For Truth</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Special Collaborator</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Not grandiloquent at all</strong><p>\"For truth\" is Marc Carlton's latest album at time of writing, although he has recently \r\ncompleted work on \"The far tide\", a computer game related project. Released in 2009, this \r\nis is first full length album since \"Reflex arc\" in 2005, the interim \"Ovriah\" being a mini-\r\nalbum of material mostly written some years previously.<p>As with all his releases, Carlton writes, arranges and performs all the music himself.  The \r\ntheme of the album is a lamenting of the way genuine \"truth\" has been lost in a world \r\nof \"subjective\" truth, or as Carlton enigmatically puts it \"rendered grandiloquent by \r\npostmodernist scorn\".<p>This time around the tracks which make up the album are self contained pieces, with no \r\nattempt being made to link them together to form a <em>whole</em>. Thus we begin with the \r\nrelatively lively 12 minute title track, which sees Carlton arguably at his most ambitious, \r\nthen move directly into an equally long solo acoustic guitar rendition entitled \"One Possible \r\nDream\". The latter resembles some of the more relaxed works of Steve Hackett or Anthony \r\nPhillips, the track as a whole displaying Carlton's admirable guitar virtuosity. <p>\"Ghosts Where Once We Hid\" is a fine arrangement of symphonic string synthesiser and \r\nacoustic guitar, similar to Vivaldi's \"Guitar concerto\" as adapted by Continuum and also \r\nSteve Howe. \"Intersection Minor\" is the first of a couple of brief interlude pieces, Steve \r\nHackett's influence once again being apparent on this \"Blood on the rooftops\" like acoustic \r\nguitar rendition.<p>\"Caught In The Fourth Wall\" has a rather spacey atmosphere to begin with, before moving \r\ninto perhaps the heaviest territory Carlton has ever allowed himself to stray into. There is a \r\nrather doomy undercurrent to the music here which belies any notion that Marc does not \r\nhave ambitions beyond the pleasant and relaxing. Things brighten up again with \"Mindfire\", \r\nwhere melodic guitar is backed by symphonic strings. <p>\"Return From Fading Landscapes\" is the final track to breach 10 minutes (the album runs \r\nto over 70 minutes in total). Here we have an odd blend of the light and the dark, with \r\nmelodic <em>twinkling</em> being counterpointed by some decidedly darker moods. Carlton's \r\nlead guitar work is the high point here. <p>The second of the interlude pieces is naturally called \"Intersection Major\" this \"Horizons\" \r\nlike track running to under 2 minutes. The closing \"Reason Or Die\" draws together the \r\nmoods and sounds of the album in a single, beautifully crafted piece. Chorale and string \r\nkeyboards blend with some fine lead guitar and surprisingly intrusive percussion to create \r\na track which is more demanding of the listener than the bulk of Carlton's work. <p>In all, \"For truth\" stands as Marc Carlton's most accomplished work to date. Here, he \r\ndisplays a confidence in both the technology he uses and his own talents, allowing him to \r\nexplore more challenging territories than hitherto. The tenets which have serve him well on \r\nprevious albums are still reassuringly in evidence, but here he uses those values as a \r\nfoundation from which he builds something truly inspired.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=302638#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=302638\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=302638\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 7, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22870#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #302638)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=16673\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_2813151092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" Ovriah by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2007<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"3.50 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">3.50</span> | 2 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=16673#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=16673\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Ovriah</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Special Collaborator</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Portrait of a man</strong><p>In a fascinating, exclusive interview for this site in 2007 (see the Interviews section of the \r\nforum), Marc Carlton provides some interesting background to this album. \"Ovriah\" was \r\none of the first pieces of music Marc ever wrote, but at the time he felt he did not have the \r\nskills or equipment to do the piece justice as a recording. An early acoustic version \r\nappeared as \"Ovriah II\", a track on Carlton's first album, but it took another 8 years for things \r\nto go any further. When he decided the time was right to commit the music to tape, the \r\nrecordings were reasonably straightforward, helped in no small part by Marc's long time \r\nfamiliarity with the music.<p>When asked about the relatively short length of the album (a shade under 40 minutes), \r\nMarc says that he sees it as an EP or mini-album. Admirably, he says he resisted the urge \r\nto pad the album out simply to fill the space available on a CD. The music is intended as \r\na \"symphonic portrait\" of someone called \"Ovriah\", in seven parts. \"Ovriah\" was a character \r\nin a book Carlton was writing in the mid-late 1990's.  <p>The music here is closer to that which appeared on \"Still\" than on \"Reflex arc\", being \r\ngenerally more ambient and <em>unhurried</em>. Soft sound based colours dominate the \r\nearly tracks, with waves of pleasant noise being preferred to discernible melodies. As the \r\nthird section \"Ovriah's Distance\" develops, electric and acoustic guitars move us towards a \r\nmore defined musical structure. This development is sustained on the \r\nfollowing \"Triumvirate\", where harsh rock based lead guitar suddenly sends us in a \r\ncompletely unexpected direction. As such, this section represents the musical crescendo \r\nof the piece, a sort of apex if you will, after which we are gradually returned from whence we \r\nstarted. <p>Marc's affection for the music of Mike Oldfield becomes obvious on \"Tabula Rasa\", a more \r\northodox gentle rock section featuring lead guitar. Some fine piano rounds things off nicely \r\non the closing \"Who Sleeps In Throne Eternal\".<p>In all, a highly enjoyable album of <em>moods</em>. There is little here by way of excitement \r\n(other than on \"Triumvirate\"), this most definitely is music to unwind to.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=302259#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=302259\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=302259\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 5, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=16673#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #302259)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review item box -->\r\n<div class=\"reviewbox\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Cover Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-cover-zone\">\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=9394\"><img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/2059/cover_42151092019_r.jpg\" alt=\" Reflex Arc by CARLTON, MARC album cover\" align=\"center\" border=0 hspace=2 vspace=2 class=\"review-cover-zone-img\"></a>\r\n<span style=\"color:#777;font-size:12px;\">\r\nStudio Album, 2005<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#C75D4F;\" title=\"3.97 out of 5 (PA Average Rating Value)\">3.97</span> | 10 ratings\r\n</span><br>\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=9394#buymusic\">BUY</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Review Zone -->\r\n<div class=\"review-text-zone\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"album.asp?id=9394\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:13px\">Reflex Arc</span></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"artist.asp?id=2059\">Marc Carlton</a> <span style=\"color:#777;font-size:9px;\">Crossover Prog</span><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Review by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>Special Collaborator</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\t\r\n\t<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='http://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n\t</a>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Contains some fine numbers</strong><p>Released in 2005, a year after \"Still\", \"Reflex arc\" may perhaps be labelled as an <em>abstract \r\nconcept album</em>. This is the only album to date not released by Marc through his own \r\nlabel, \"Reflex arc\" being distributed by Musea Records. The track titles give no hint as to the \r\nthemes which link the tracks, as they simply restate the track numbers in narrative form \r\nfrom \"One to \"Sixteen\". <p>According to Carlton, \"this project carries the multifaceted theme of human responses; some \r\nunconscious, some we are aware of, but all of which make up who we are.\" The relative brevity \r\nof most of the tracks confirms that the album is intended to be heard as a complete piece, \r\nsimilar to many of the works of Carlton's inspiration Mike Oldfield. As with the work ethic of \r\nOldfield, Marc once again plays all the instruments here, the emphasis being on guitars and \r\nkeyboards. <p>Right from the opening track, (\"One\"!) it is apparent that Marc is seeking to distance himself \r\nfrom the new age nuances which were a feature of previous albums. Here, improvisation \r\nplays a much greater part, at least in the compositional phase. The sounds and themes are \r\nfar more varied this time, with little in the way of overt repetition.<p>Highlights include \"Three\", where choral keyboard effects and melodic guitars combine in a \r\nbeautiful cacophony of sound, and \"Six\" which sounds like it could have been lifted from \r\nOldfield's \"The songs of distant earth\", the lead guitar here being particularity effective. The \r\nalbum is brought to the perfect conclusion with the ethereal \"sixteen\".<p>Overall, while this album has obvious structural similarities to the work of Mike Oldfield, I \r\nactually find it reminds me more of some of Anthony Phillips best works such as \"Slow dance\". \r\nThe music here is that of a talented composer who is able to work within his own strict quality \r\ncontrols to create an album of great beauty and imagination. Recommended. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=301429#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=301429\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=301429\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, October 1, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=9394#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #301429)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:15px 0px;\">\r\n<font color=\"#a52a2a\">Thanks to <strong>Garion81</strong> for the artist addition.\r\n\r\nand to <strong>Quinino</strong> for the last updates\r\n\r\n</font>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div><!-- End Main DIV -->\r\n\r\n\r\n</div> <!--END MAIN DIV-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:5px 0px;\">\r\nCopyright Prog Archives, All rights reserved. | <a href=\"Legalnotice.asp\"><font color=\"white\">Legal Notice</font></a> | <a href=\"PrivacyPolicy.asp\"><font color=\"white\">Privacy Policy</font></a> | <a href=\"/about_us.asp#advertise\"><font color=\"white\">Advertise</font></a><img src=\"../static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"> | <a href=\"/syndication.asp\"><font color=\"white\">RSS + syndications</font></a><img src=\"../static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:5px 0px;\">\r\n<strong>Other sites in the MAC network:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.JazzMusicArchives.com\"><font color=\"white\">JazzMusicArchives.com &mdash; jazz music reviews and archives</font></a> | <a href=\"http://www.MetalMusicArchives.com\"><font color=\"white\">MetalMusicArchives.com &mdash; metal music reviews and archives</font></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:20px 0px;\">\r\nDonate monthly and keep PA fast-loading and ad-free forever.\r\n<div style=\"margin:5px 0 0 0\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DRNRB8RG8NUN2\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=center class=\"cls_TextCopyright\" style=\"margin:0px 0px;\">\r\n<!-- Server processing time: 0.84 seconds -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<script>(function(){function c(){var b=a.contentDocument||a.contentWindow.document;if(b){var d=b.createElement('script');d.innerHTML=\"window.__CF$cv$params={r:'925ad37e0ba402f1',t:'MTc0Mjg2ODE0Ni4wMDAwMDA='};var a=document.createElement('script');a.nonce='';a.src='/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/scripts/jsd/main.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(a);\";b.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(d)}}if(document.body){var a=document.createElement('iframe');a.height=1;a.width=1;a.style.position='absolute';a.style.top=0;a.style.left=0;a.style.border='none';a.style.visibility='hidden';document.body.appendChild(a);if('loading'!==document.readyState)c();else if(window.addEventListener)document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',c);else{var e=document.onreadystatechange||function(){};document.onreadystatechange=function(b){e(b);'loading'!==document.readyState&&(document.onreadystatechange=e,c())}}}})();</script></body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\n",
