In fact, the lineup shake from Frequency to this is the largest \r\nbetween any two consecutive IQ albums, with three of the five band members not appearing on \r\nFrequency. Paul Cook and Tim Esau are, of course, old hands in IQ, being the group's original \r\nrhythm section (indeed, Frequency was the only IQ album not to feature Cookie on drums), \r\nwhilst Sphere3 keyboardist Neil Durant makes his first appearance on an IQ album here.<p>The obvious question, then, is how this shakeup affects the band's sound. Frequency was a \r\nrefreshing update to the IQ sound; would the return of Paul Cook and Tim Esau reverse that \r\nmusical progression, or would Neil Durant's inclusion allow the group to continue it? As it \r\ntranspires, Durant is the surprise star player here, proving equally adept at a bang-up-to-date \r\nkeyboard style and performances living up to the heritage of IQ's earlier material. \r\n(Constellations, one of several tracks on the bonus disc in the special edition of the album, \r\nshowcases this distinction particularly nicely.)<p>Tonally, the album finds IQ in a melancholic and reflective mood - one which often serves them \r\nwell, as it did on albums such as The Wake or Ever - whilst the special edition of the album \r\nprovides a bonus disc with a brace of songs which to my ears are just as strong as the \r\ncompositions that made the cut, but which didn't fit the particular vibe they are going for here, \r\nand as a result the special edition presents a more diverse sound. Whether you plump for the \r\n1CD or 2CD editions, right here you have IQ incredibly managing to continue their streak of top-\r\nquality albums which began with the classic Ever and still shows no signs of slowing down.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1164452#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1164452\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1164452\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, April 23, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1164452)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23657\"><strong>rdtprog</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Heavy, RPI, Symph, JR/F Canterbury Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23657/131270147_3536190126417926_2125830169311317071_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe band has developed their sound over the years with a modern symphonic sound that alternate some\r\ndelicate often melancholic piano and keyboards lines with heavier and faster guitar parts. They know\r\nhow to build their songs with a dark atmosphere set by the piano, vocals and keyboards that let\r\nslowly the spot to the dynamics guitars of Mike Holmes. A nice touch has been added here with the\r\nsound of xylophone and techno sounds that can be hear throughout this CD, probably the influence of\r\nMike Holmes vision, who has produced and play in the excellent Regeneration CD with the Lens that\r\ncontains a lot of techno sound.<p>Sometimes we recognize some IQ previous passages from their older material, but not to the point to\r\nbe a copy of it. I am glad to see that the band still got more ideas to create some nice music.\r\nSince the departure of Martin Orford, the keyboards sound has changed a bit, more diverse, so that\r\nis reflecting on the music. There is more ambient sounds that prepare us to the more energic part of\r\nthe song were the tempo is getting faster in the typical IQ fashion. After many years, it's always\r\nnice to hear the great production in their music. The band has put all the ingredients together to\r\nmake the perfect progressive rock CD; inspiring songwriting, diverse arrangements that harmonize the\r\nacoustic with the electric and a great sense of the melody like not many bands can do. We can say\r\nthat IQ is the modern version of the old Genesis, because of the voice of Peter Nicholls, some\r\nHackett guitar influence and also some Banks reference that we can find at some places on this\r\nrelease, but they have surpassed this influence long time ago. The bonus CD is also of high of\r\nquality with again more spacey and techno sounds, something that was emerging in the first CD,\r\nsometimes reminiscent of Vangelis and Depeche Mode. It's a little breather from the first CD,\r\nespecially for Mike Holmes who takes a break here to comeback in the last song. The pace is slower\r\nand more relax on this one, but it complete perfectly this great release.<p>I have always found difficult to pick a favorite one in IQ discography, but I think that this one\r\ncould become my favorite. I can't give anything less than 5 stars. I am sure that many will share my\r\nenthusiasm with this new release.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1171816#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1171816\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1171816\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, May 6, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1171816)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=21717\"><strong>lazland</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=21717\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/21717/C9F46CF2-046E-4575-B1C8-33DFCCEEC05A.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ, that venerable outfit of 1980's vintage, release this, their 11th studio offering, and, I will say straight away, are sounding as \r\nstrong, if not stronger, than ever.<p>This review is of the double cd I pre-ordered, and which is available now from all the usual quality outlets, and I would wholly \r\nrecommend that potential purchasers get the whole thing. To be very fair to IQ, they have made the entire work available on release \r\nat a reasonable price, with no follow up rip-off's to us poor old punters, and support is deserved for that alone.<p>The first cd, The Road Of Bones itself, is a concept piece that is not just dark, but actually very bleak and positively gothic in places, \r\ntelling the story of a rather nasty serial killer in the first person. You would think, then, that the music itself would match such a story; \r\nyou know, an album which would make Pink Floyd's The Wall a veritable ray of sunshine to come down to after listening.<p>But, no, not a bit of it. This sumptuously produced (and Mike Holmes has really exceeded himself in this department), and \r\ngorgeously performed work just about takes us through the entire range of emotions, with passages which are achingly beautiful, \r\nand a rock experience which takes us from the hard and crashing opening, thundering, riffs of opener From The Outside In, to the \r\nquite gorgeous acoustic interplay on guitar, piano, and vocals at the denouement of closer, Until The End (which itself follows a \r\nreally beautiful wall of sound in the finest symphonic tradition).<p>More experienced IQ followers such as myself will, on the first couple of listens, have been surprised at the relative absence of \r\ngenuine Holmes guitar bursts of days of yore. Indeed, it is, in my opinion, fair to say that this is the most keyboard dominated IQ \r\nalbum in many a year, perhaps ever, and massive credit must go to Neil Durant, who creates such a huge wall of sound and \r\nvirtuoso performance that really do go up against the best Orford produced for the band, he is that good. However, saying this, this \r\nalbum is a genuine ensemble piece. The joy of hearing our favourite rhythm section of Cook and Esau, who shine especially on the \r\nbeautiful title track, whilst Holmes, if not understated, is most certainly not at the forefront of all the action as he was during much of \r\nFrequency, although his bursts towards the close of epic Without Walls are pure trademark Holmes brilliance, and remind one of the \r\nsimilar beauty of Dark Matter. And, thence, to Peter Nicholls. I have always loved this man's voice, a set of chords capable of belting \r\nout a massive piece one minute, with a tear inducing piece of fragility the very next, and so it is on this album. His voice, if anything, \r\nis growing and becoming a damned sight better the older he gets, and his is without doubt the only one I can think of capable of \r\ntelling this theatrical piece properly.<p>There are five tracks on the first cd, and all of them, without exception, are essential IQ, that is, for those who know my opinion in \r\nsuch matters, right up there with the best progressive rock. Without Walls, just a shade short of twenty minutes long, never once \r\nfails to grip your attention and pull your heart strings. It contains all the vital elements that make this band so important, from those \r\nwell versed symphonic soundscapes, to very dark introspective instrumental passages, massive riffs, some lovely acoustic work, \r\nsome very clever sound effects, and quieter moments which, rather frighteningly, allow us in the subject's innermost feelings. The \r\nmanner in which the vocals and music change mood and interpret a story are fantastic.<p>And so to cd two. There are those who tell you that it is as good as cd one. They are extremely close to the knuckle, because, in \r\nProg Archives parlance, cd one is a masterpiece, whilst the second helping is merely excellent. Which is to say, again, that it is at \r\nthe top of the prog tree. Highlights for me are the exceptional Constellations, on which this lineup sound as if they have played \r\ntogether all of their career, with Durant, especially, sounding wonderful, helping to create a pomp prog spectacular; the clever \r\ninstrumental 1312 Overture (so named because of its time signature); and the really rather exceptional opener, Knucklehead, which \r\nis perhaps one of the most experimental, and heavy, pieces they have released, although, in all honesty, there is nary a bum note or \r\npoor moment present throughout the cd. These are not \"throwaway\" bonus tracks, but a set of pieces which, whilst they did not fit \r\ninto the main concept, deserved a release of their own. I for one, am very grateful they were. Six tracks, and 50 minutes of quality \r\nprogressive rock.<p>So, how to rate this? I think that IQ are a band who are still improving, which, given the fact that they have released some of the \r\nmost important and vital neo-prog over the course of 31 years, is a testament to the quality present here. This is the sound of a \r\nband still striving to develop, mature, yet staying true to their glorious roots. It is simply a magnificent experience to listen to, and is \r\ngenuinely the first utterly essential purchase of 2014 for me. Probably 4.5 stars, if we had such a rating, but rounded up to five \r\nbecause it is warranted.<p>I tell you this. Pendragon, those other venerable survivors of yesteryear, will have to go some to match this when they release their \r\nown much anticipated new work later this year.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1172597#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1172597\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1172597\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, May 8, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1172597)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8691\"><strong>Flucktrot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8691\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070908_201329_joshuatree.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI was looking for some new prog to blow me away, and I did not expect it to come from IQ! I \r\nlove the band, and they have been quite consistent over years and years, but there was no \r\nindication from the casual prog fan that they would be about to release an excellent new \r\nalbum that stays true to what the band does best--especially surprising because Frequency \r\nincluded some departures, indicating further experimentation--and has tightened up nearly \r\nevery nitpick I might be able to come up with about the group. The fact that IQ has come up \r\nwith this album, at this point in the band's career, has really elevated my respect for the \r\ngroup. I can't think of any bands off the top of my head who have accomplished this.<p>Here's just a few of the reasons why I find this to be a fantastic album:<p>1. Quantity and quality combo. To fill two discs worth of quality music, with really no low or \r\nskippable moments, is something that few bands have achieved, at least in my opinion. <p>2. Interesting subject material. I don't know much about the album theme, but that's the \r\nwhole point: it's gotten me to do homework outside of my listening experience and educate \r\nmyself on an important historical topic. Few albums in my experience have done that!<p>3. True team effort. Each member really shines, which is another compliment that I rarely \r\ngive. Cook does some excellent fills and dynamics, and I appreciate that he's not just \"balls-\r\nout\" all the time. Holmes continues his Hackett-esque performance as well. He's not as \r\ncontinually present on this album, but he's there when you need it. For example, the Holmes \r\nrip at the end of Without Walls is classic: you're waiting the whole song for it, and when it \r\ncomes, it's not technically amazing, but it's perfect for the moment, gets burned in your \r\nbrain, and leaves you completely satisfied. Nicholls deserves special recognition as well. \r\nIt's simply amazing how much better his voice gets over time, and it's a great model of \r\nsuccessful aging. Esau brings wonderful variety on bass, which in my mind could come \r\nand go in previous IQ efforts. Finally, Durant is probably the standout among standouts. He \r\nprovides the buzzy, bassy synths, tons of atmospherics, and, most impressively a perfect \r\nbalance between wiggly synth lines and tasteful melodies. <p>4. Presentation/lead up. Great cover, and, in hindsight, great choice for the title track. The \r\ntitle track is not an album highlight, in my opinion, but it offered the perfect tease of the \r\nalternating ambiance and intensity of the album. It got my attention in a big way, but it also \r\nleft me wanting more. Imagine how satisfied I am now that I indeed got more, and in \r\nhindsight, much more than I had hoped for!<p>5. Classic IQ song structure. These songs have a nice build of tension and pensive \r\nchugging (at least the extended pieces), but then things tend to pick up in fascinating ways, \r\nand then they deliver the big, warm reprise of which that IQ has made a clear niche.<p>6. Production. This album just sounds incredible, and it's a tribute to the talent and attention \r\nto detail that went into its creation.<p>Highlights: From the Outside In, Without Walls, Until the End, Constellations. We have the \r\ngrinding IQ rocker (Arena, Immortal? era), the epic journey (complete with a wonderful nod \r\nthe The Gates of Delirium toward the finale), and two extended pieces that remind me of the \r\nbest of classic Collins-as-frontman Genesis. My only quibble is that I think the 1312 \r\nOverture (Rush YYZ influence!) would have made a perfect opener for the album, but that is \r\na quibble in the smallest sense.<p>Why not a five-star? For me, satisfying is not equivalent to mind-blowing, and this album is \r\nnot mind-blowing. It's excellent, and that's why I like it so much. The highs are excellent, but \r\nthey are not incredible, and thus, no masterpiece. Either way, it's my favorite IQ album, and I \r\nnever saw it coming. These surprises are why it's worth it to keep coming back to prog, even \r\nwhen it seems like it has nothing left to give.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1172745#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1172745\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1172745\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, May 8, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1172745)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=42185\"><strong>Second Life Syndrome</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=42185\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/42185/riverside.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWell, apparently I'm in the minority on this album from IQ.  \"The Road of Bones\" is this neo-\r\nprog band's newest foray, and it comes across as darker and more mature lyrically than \r\nsome of their previous albums.  With a malevolent theme and what I expected to be \r\nstunning contrasts between dark riffs and bright synth, \"The Road of Bones\" was supposed \r\nto be a killer album, for me especially.<p>There's something off about this album that I can't quite place.  IQ has certainly given us an \r\ninteresting album, as it's full of atmospheric and driving guitars, some great synth work, and \r\nsome wonderful bass and drums.  However, nothing particularly stands out for me.  None of \r\nthe instrumentation seems truly on point, crisp, or inspired.  Take, for instance, the driving \r\nriffs in the opener \"From the Outside In\".  It's as if I've heard that same particular passage a \r\nhundred times in other albums.  It's good, don't get me wrong, but nothing special.<p>There are other examples, though.  The 20 minute epic \"Without Walls\" should be the \r\ncornerstone of this album.  Instead, it contains only a handful of memorable moments as it \r\nplods along with little to no direction.  Still another example can be found in the quieter \r\nmoments of the album.  IQ attempts to create some thick atmospheric sections that mainly \r\nconsist of limited piano and singer Peter Nicholls' ponderous voice.  This type of thing \r\nusually thrills me.  I'd even call myself easy to please.  However, the vocal lines are \r\ncompletely forgettable and the transitions to the rest of the song are just kinda there.  <p>I think that's my main issue with this album.  It all just so \"blah\".  It's not bad.  It can even be \r\nenjoyable at times.  However, it's so painfully average and pedestrian that I'd almost rather \r\nhear a band fail miserably at trying something new than listen to this flat, unremarkable \r\nalbum.  In fact, even the cover art is so middle of the road.  Sure, the performances \r\n(especially Nicholls' vocals) are okay, but, in the end, I think most amateur high school \r\nbands could play most of this, and probably compose something better, too.<p>So, what saves this album?  The title track is one of the best songs I've heard in 2014.  It's \r\nso unfortunate and somewhat ironic, no?  The title track is climactic, brooding, and ends in \r\nblazing glory.  It finally provided that contrast I was seeking, and the lyrics are so personal.  \r\nSo, yes, this album was saved from an even worse rating through this one song, and also \r\nby the last 30 seconds of the album wherein IQ gives us the first atmospheric vocal/piano \r\npassage that actually connects.<p>I usually am the one that is pleased with an album while others are lambasting it.  However, \r\nI just can't see why others are praising this album, some calling it the possible album of the \r\nyear already.  If one great song and a handful of interesting minutes are enough to deserve \r\nthat label, then I don't know why I even write anymore.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1172773#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1172773\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1172773\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, May 8, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1172773)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Prog does not necessary mean 'complex' ...</strong><p>...and IQ has proved it nicely in this wonderfully crafted album that die hard fans like myself \r\nfeel that it's worth waiting for an almost five years since its previous \"Frequency\" album \r\nreleased in 2009. It's been quite a while I have been thinking about writing the review of this \r\nlong awaited album by the most consistent band on planet Earth in terms of music direction \r\nand sub-genre. They dare to stand tall with their direction in what so called neo progressive. \r\nI really admire IQ on this. One of major consideration for not taking part in writing my view on \r\nthis album has been a juggle of complexity and simplicity. The matter is like this: almost at \r\nthe same time of The Road of Bones by IQ , there is another excellent album by a \r\nsupergroup Transatlantic who also released \"Kaleidoscope\" album. The fundamental \r\nquestion is only one: if I consider Kaleidoscope as an excellent album with a four star rating \r\nwhy should I give IQ with a five-star rating? Transatlantic music is more complex and \r\nchallenging compared to IQ who plays simple prog music. I finally thought that the \r\nfundamental difference is on how each album maneuvers deeply into my emotion and it's \r\ntotally a very personal taste and preference.  Music to me is emotion and I have to admit that \r\nmost of IQ music is very able to stir my emotion regardless its lyrics. the way the music is \r\ncomposed and then combined beautifully with melody line through vocal work as well as \r\nhow solo works are intertwined sound really fantastic to my ears. That's why I put a full five \r\nstar rating for this new album by IQ.<p>As I put emotionally at my FB status:<p><em>Np. IQ \"the Road of Bones\" ...a fabulous album. The opening track sounds like IQ plays \r\nmetal as the music is in the vein of The Wake with high energy, powerful riffs resulted from \r\ntight basslines by the old timer Tim Esau (happy that he returned back to the band he \r\nsupposed to be). It;s really a killer and it's strategically positioned as an album opener - \r\nwhat a brilliant idea! However, the second track is also another killer even though it starts in \r\nan ambient mode and moves slowly until ...again Tim Esau plays wonderfully with his bass \r\nguitar (is it a Rickenbaker? probably!). Not only that ... I love the way how the new keyboard \r\nplayer, Neil Durrant, inserts his mellotron-like sound at the background during the peak \r\nsegments ....oh my God ...! <p>What a fabulous musical journey I have experienced listening to only the first two damn \r\nkilling tracks!!! I can not even afford to move to next tracks as my fingers keep pressing \r\nbackward two times to get back to the opening track again .....!!! Oh no .....!!! This is truly a \r\ntotally ngguweblak experience man!!! I bet you ....! Marillion Hogarth era must have learned a \r\nlot from being consistent ( or they are not capable anymore?) in neo prog music like IQ has \r\ndemonstrated for years ... Yeah ...more than 30 years of prog nonsense!</em><p>That long phrases resonate how this album really hooked me ('nggeblak' is my local \r\nexpression on how the music has made me temporarily 'paralyzed' !) at first spin by only \r\nlistening to the first two tracks only!<p>IQ album has always been like that to me. At first spin I only could enjoy couple of tracks. It's \r\nnot that I am too lazy to find the full journey and got the deep meaning of the music but ... I \r\nhave already been \"satisfied\" by couple of tracks only - not the entire album. But as time \r\nwent by I started to enjoy other tracks. Take example the Frequency album which at first I \r\ncould only play regularly the title track, second track \"Life Support\" and a bit of some from \r\nother tracks. And guess what ....at later stage, maybe a year later... I Was totally in love with \r\nthe \"Ryker Skies\" track that really make me 'ngguweblak!' to the bone. Yeah ... Ryker Skies is \r\nreally a kiling track! I like the melody as well as the chorus line. It's really wonderful.<p>My experience with The Road of Bones album is similar with Frequency as I fell in love at \r\nfirst listen to the first two tracks. Iplayed these two tracks over and over again until I was \r\ntotally satisfied then I moved to next. The thing was, I mentioned in phrases of FB status, I \r\ncould not afford to move further as the second track \"The Road of Bones\" finished I \r\nautomatically wanted to go back to listen to the first track \"From The Outside In\". Then the \r\njourney continued with the album title track which is basically a simple composition but it's \r\nreally heavy in nuances. I really love the first two tracks that made me play the two until I got \r\nit 'enough' to move to the next one.<p>Only recently I pay attention to the third track \"Without Walls\" which indeed I like it very much \r\ntoo. It sounded to me at first reaction that this song somehow reminds me to 'Harvest of \r\nSouls' from the Dark Matter album. It starts ambient with a simple piano sounds followed \r\nwith a drum loop that made me surprised as this is , I think, the first time IQ use the sound \r\nof drum loop. It was quite weird at first listen but as it grew on me , I then finally found that \r\nthe loop has become a nice integral part of the whole song. The first three minutes plus \r\nduration this song moves in ambient mode accompanying a dark vocal line by Nicholls. But \r\nthen the music moves in crescendo with a follow-up riff played in slow tempo. What a \r\nwonderful move! ...<p><strong> ...and the war starts at minute 6 </strong><p>...as indicated by the very wonderful keyboard shot by Neil Durant that sounds really cool \r\nwhile accompanying Nicholls' vocal line. But that happens temporary as the music then is \r\nslowing down with long sustain keyboard sound at the back plus acoustic guitar rhythm \r\nsection work by Mike Holmes. It's quite nice and reminds me to the nuance of Pink Floyd's \r\nDogs from Animals album. The war continues again at min 10:22 as the music is heating \r\nup into faster tempo. And the peak of nice war happens at minute 12:20 when keyboard \r\nreally take the lead in a wonderfully crafted solo backed with relatively fast tempo music. Oh \r\nman .... it's really coooooool!!!!<p>The next track \"Ocean\" is probably the most pop song compared to other tracks but it's really \r\ngood as a refreshment just before another excellent track Until the End that concludes the \r\nalbum excellently.<p>Even though my CD package is the limited edition version with two CDs, I only make the \r\nreview for the CD One as this is the main album. CD Two is nice also even though it's \r\nbasically left overs. For IQ I always purchase the limited edition package as it has great \r\nbonus like the one in Frequency that contains live DVD of IQ - great performance, really! This \r\ntime I did not preorder because my good friend who is a die hard fan of IQ purchased it for \r\nme PLUS the t-shirt (WHOOOAAAA!!!!!! Great one!!!) at IQ performance at Islington Assembly \r\nHall, London, 3 May 2014.<p>Overall, this is truly a fabulous album by IQ who has consistently produced excellent music \r\nfrom their more than 30 years of prog nonsense! I really love this album and it's still ini my \r\nregular playlist that I regularly play while I am working ora cycling or sipping a cup of coffee. \r\nThe composition is really topnotch with fantastic melody line, great harmonies among \r\ninstruments being played (even though this time Mr Holmes does not play that much long \r\nstunning guitar solo), beautiful transition pieces on changes of tempo, and most importantly \r\n...this album is so cohesive so that the structural integrity has been successfully maintained \r\nfrom start to end. BINGO! It;s a perfect album that deserves a FULL five-star rating. Keep on \r\nproggin' ...!<p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1181642#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1181642\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1181642\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, May 31, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1181642)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5626\"><strong>kev rowland</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Reviewer / Special Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5626\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5626/computersmash.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWhen this album arrived I didn't put it on the player straight away, but instead looked at the \r\nartwork and booklet, and kept thinking about Schr'dinger's cat. I so very much wanted this to \r\nbe a great album, and until I put it on the player (and I still haven't read single review about \r\nthis album as I needed to ensure that I wasn't being swayed one way or another) this was \r\nboth a great album, and a poor one, both at the same time. I first saw IQ in concert some time \r\nin the Eighties when they supported Magnum at the Hammersmith Odeon and have seen \r\nthem quite a few times since, the last being on the 'Dark Matter' tour. During that time I built \r\nup a strong relationship with Martin Orford, and saw him play solo a few times as well as with \r\nGary Chandler and of course with Jadis as well, but after I moved to NZ he told me that he \r\nhad left the band of which he was a co-founder. That shook me, and by the time IQ released \r\n'Frequency' some five years after 'DM', Paul Cook had gone as well. I wasn't a fan of that \r\nalbum (and I totally understand that this could be due to emotions as opposed to quality of \r\nmusic), so what about this one? Great or poor?\r\n<p><p>\r\nFive years on from 'Frequency' and yet again there have been changes in line-up. Paul Cook \r\nhas returned, but perhaps the biggest surprise is that JJ is no longer on bass, but instead has \r\nbeen replaced by the man he himself replaced in the first place! Tim Esau is back, with his \r\nfirst album with IQ since 1989's 'Are You Sitting Comfortably?' I have always been a real fan \r\nof his playing and methods of attack, as he can easily move from fretless bass to many \r\ndifferent styles: just check out 'Screaming' from 'Nomzamo' to see what I mean. Then on \r\nkeyboards we have none other than Neil Durant. Neil may well be an unknown to many of \r\nyou, but we have been friends for well over twenty years as he sent me the very first Sphere \r\ndemo back in 1992 (and Neil knows I still have it, potential blackmail is a wonderful thing).  A \r\nsecond demo followed in 1994, and they belatedly followed it up with a CD release on \r\nCyclops in 2002, and it always amazed me that Sphere didn't become far more well known as \r\nthey were/are all great musicians. I even managed to see them gig once in the Nineties, but \r\nhere at long last Neil is able to put his talents to use on a larger stage.\r\n<p><p>\r\nSo, of the five members, four of them played on the first two totally classic IQ albums, so what \r\nwould the band sound like in 2014, with one brand new member and two who had left (for \r\nvery different timeframes) only to return? Absolutely brilliant is the way I would describe it.\r\n<p><p>\r\nWhen opener 'From The Outside In' really gets going it reminded me of the very first time I \r\nheard 'Ever', when the band was again returning after a period of unrest: that time with a \r\nreturning singer and a new bassist, four years after their previous release. Neil has always \r\nbeen a very fine keyboard player indeed, and here he has tempered the jazz influences he \r\nnormally displays to fit in, and has also incorporated a lot of keyboard sounds that fans of the \r\nband will recognise from days gone past. He isn't Widge, and doesn't want to be, but he has \r\nmade the seat his own by bringing in enough of the old to combine with the new that it doesn't \r\nalienate the fans of the old band yet starts to move in a slightly different direction. This is a \r\ndark album in many ways, and this comes through in the artwork as well as the album itself. In \r\nmany ways this feels like a logical follow-on from 'Dark Matter' or 'Subterranea' as opposed to \r\n'Frequency', and that has to be a good thing in my book.  \r\n<p><p>\r\nThis is an album that I have fallen in love with as everything is right from the musicianship to \r\nthe songs, from the production to the artwork. This is solid IQ, with everyone firmly gelling and \r\nproducing more of the incredible music we have learned to expect from them, from rockers \r\nthrough to ballads, simplicity and complexity combining in a way that many have attempted to \r\ncopy, but few have ever managed to achieve the heights. I have the double disc set, 11 songs \r\nat just over 100 minutes long, and it absolutely flies by as one classic leads into another. It \r\nwould be wonderful to be able to see these guys play live, but I guess that isn't going to \r\nhappen for me as I live so far away, so I'll just have to keep playing this. Again. And Again.\r\n <p><p>\r\nAnd as for that cat I mentioned at the beginning. He is purring and stretching, ready to jump \r\nout of the box and take on the world. IQ are back where they belong, at the very top. www.iq-\r\nhq.com \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1181688#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1181688\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1181688\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 1, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1181688)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=14399\"><strong>Hercules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=14399\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/14399/Wrapped_up_parrot_Hercules.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n*This review is of the 2 CD edition.*<p>I must have played this album 30 times or more, so I now feel able to review it.<p>First spins of the main disc were not particularly encouraging. Apart from the title track, which is \r\namazing on first listen, the rest seemed dark and a bit uninspired, I moved on to disc 2 (where the \r\ncast offs/second rate tracks usually reside) and actually liked that much more.<p>However, IQ's material needs time to sink in. This is their first album entirely without Martin Orford \r\n(he wrote a lot of the material on Frequency before he retired) and, whilst the influences are similar, \r\nthe execution is rather less bombastic.<p>Of course, there have also been personnel changes. Paul Cook is less flashy than Andy Edwards \r\nbut he fits the band perfectly. Neil Durant shows astonishing skill on keyboards, at times sounding \r\nvery like the great Mr Orford but not imitating him. He is all over the album in the way Mr Orford was \r\non Dark Matter, but less obtrusively; less \"in yer face\". But the real revelation is Tim Esau; the \r\nintervening years since he last played with the band have seen him develop into a superlative player \r\nwho is equally at ease on fretted and fretless basses and conjures up some wonderful bass lines.<p>Peter Nicholls has written some very deep dark lyrics and sings better than ever, but Mike Holmes is \r\nrather restrained, contributing far fewer of his trademark solos and much more heavy riffing.<p>As for the main disc, the title track and Oceans, a beautiful gentle track which is the one light \r\nmoment on the album, driven by Esau's bass and Durant's keys, stand out. The other tracks grow on \r\nyou greatly with time and Until the End really excels, with some nice acoustic guitar and hints of \r\nsome Scottish tune I just can't place. The epic, Without Walls, has some marvellous passages but \r\njust doesn't quite gel; it seems like lots of bits of songs joined together. For this reason, the main disc \r\nwould get a high 4*.<p>However, the 2CD edition has Constellation and Ten Million Demons, a stunning chunk of 80s style \r\nelectropop (with a bit of Chicory Tip in the outro), both of which are worthy of inclusion on the main \r\ndisc. Knucklehead, Hardcore and the 1312 Overture are also exceptional. This lifts the whole \r\npackage well into 5* territory.<p>My only real disappointment is the paucity of the great guitar solos for which Mike Holmes is famous, \r\nbut this shows that IQ are still capable of delivering music that few bands past or present can match.<p>An utterly essential album which contains easily enough great material to qualify as a masterpiece.<p><p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1181719#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1181719\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1181719\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 1, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1181719)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=40189\"><strong>FragileKings</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=40189\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/40189/marble.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSince first buying \"Frequency\" two years ago, I have kept IQ at the forefront of my listening \r\nchoices. Whether mixing a playlist for my iPhone or burning a playlist to CD, or choosing \r\nalbums to listen to during the week, IQ have more often than not made the selection cut. I \r\nhave \"Ever\", \"Subterranea\", and \"Dark Matter\" as well, and \"Seventh House\" and \"The Wake\" \r\nare also on standby for a intended future purchases. I enjoy the mixture of heavy guitar, \r\nmoody and dark or solemn music, the keyboards, and Peter Nichols' voice from the 90's \r\nonward. So when \"Road of Bones\" came out it was just a question of how soon I would \r\norder it. And I ordered the double disc version because I was sure it would be worth the \r\nextra money.<p><p>As others have written, disc one is the new album that tells a serial killer's story and disc \r\ntwo is extra material that didn't follow the story of disc one but the band still felt worthy of \r\nreleasing. I read a detailed review of both discs on a music blog and I had some ideas of \r\nwhat to expect. That reviewer said disc one was very good but some songs carried on a bit \r\nlong and disc two was better but neither were as good as \"Frequency\". As \"Frequency\" \r\nremains my favourite IQ album, I approached \"Road of Bones\" with a little caution.<p><p>First, I was impressed by how well the band sounded like IQ. They develop their sound over \r\neach album little by little but a few years pass between each release. Yes, some bands \r\nsound the same as they did 20 years ago these days but IQ have a slow evolution thing \r\ngoing on. Surely, much of the perceived change is due to the shuffling in the line up with \r\nonly Nichols and guitarist Mike Holmes remaining from \"Frequency\", and yet the band is still \r\nIQ. In a way, this album is a very natural progression from \"Frequency\" without any drastic \r\nnew change.<p><p>One of the main changes I noticed is in the keyboard sound. That classic neo-prog \r\nsynthesizer sound is still there but with some new sounds like vibraphone and a bit of \r\nelectronica hinted at without taking the plunge like Galahad have done. These sounds have \r\nbeen added to the overall IQ sound without altering the sound of the band.<p><p>The guitar in general strikes me as having been simplified. It serves more as a rhythm and \r\nmood instrument and less as a lead. I liked that Holmes actually didn't come in with his \r\ncustomary heavy chords in the title track until well into the song. It meant that by track two we \r\nwere already hearing something different from the usual IQ dark sound. The album's epic \r\ntrack \"Without Walls\" is a little easier to digest than \"Harvest of Souls\" from \"Dark Matter\", in \r\nmy opinion.<p><p>The second disc begins with \"Knucklehead\" which sounds in every way like part of the \r\n\"Road of Bones\" story. It has the whispered voices from disc one and some of the lyrics \r\nsound very much like they belong to the story. \"1312 Overture\" is a little uneventful for me. I \r\nkept expecting some exciting keyboard adventure to begin but this sounds more like a \r\nbacking track. The other songs on disc two are all enjoyable as is pretty much the whole \r\ndouble disc album. I feel as the other reviewer felt that \"Frequency\" is more exciting though \r\nthat may be because the drumming had more flare and intensity at times. There were also \r\nsongs like \"Closer\" which are very pretty, and \"Road of Bones\" doesn't get pretty for as long on either of the discs, though it still has its fair share of beautiful music in between the dark, heavy stuff.<p><p>Honestly, though, I have no real criticisms about either disc. This is a very good IQ album \r\nand nothing to be disappointed with as far as I can see. It's not a total killer but it's definitely an album worth having. Both discs.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1192137#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1192137\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1192137\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, June 14, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1192137)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ can do no wrong, in fact when it comes to Neo-Prog they are at the top of the heap in my opinion \r\nwith Fish-era MARILLION not far behind. That may be clear to me but there's a couple of things about \r\nthis recording that aren't so obvious. First of all it isn't a concept album as many have thought, in fact \r\nthe lyrics of the different songs on the first disc make that a no-brainer. The second issue is why put \r\nout a bonus disc of material when they could have just made it a double album? Well, the first proper \r\ndisc does have the same sort of mood and vibe throughout which I do prefer to the mixture of \r\nstyles like on the bonus disc, but most fans are saying they like the bonus material better than the \r\nproper album. This reminds me of when MARILLION released \"Marbles\" with a bonus disc of material \r\nwhich included \"Ocean Cloud\" which many feel is one of the best MARILLION songs ever. Since then \r\nI believe(perhaps wrongly) that \"Marbles\" is really considered a double album now by the band and \r\nfans alike. So will this eventually happen with \"The Road Of Bones\" ? <p> \"From The Outside In\" \r\nopens with some incredible atmosphere and a sample of someone speaking from a movie before this \r\nurgent rhythm kicks in with vocals. Love the mellotron swells that come and go. How about the Banks-\r\nlike organ 6 minutes in. The bass, drums and waves of mellotron are great, in fact these \r\nare the highlights of the whole album for me. \"The Road Of Bones\" is a song about a serial killer \r\nspoken in the first person. Again like the first track we start with atmosphere but this time sparse piano \r\njoins in followed by almost spoken vocals. It's all laid back here until things pick up 2 1/2 minutes in as \r\nthe drums and bass kick in. The vocals become more urgent. Check out the vibes or xylophone that \r\ncomes and goes on this one, they remind me of the eighties for some reason. I like them. It turns quite \r\npowerful 6 minutes in. Great section! <p> \"Without Walls\" is the epic at over 19 minutes. A pleasant \r\npiano melody to start. Very chilled music right here as reserved vocals join in. A change 3 minutes in \r\nthen it kicks into gear. Nice guitar work here and I like the organ that pulsates. Great section 6 minutes \r\nin as Peter sings with passion. A dark and haunting instrumental piece follows 7 1/2 minutes in. Very \r\ncool. It kicks back in before 10 1/2 minutes. Catchy stuff. It climaxes 13 1/2 minutes in, then settles \r\nback with synths before 15 minutes. Vocals are back. Mellotron and synths join in as it slowly winds \r\ndown. \"Ocean\" is mellow with relaxed vocals but things get fuller on the chorus. Themes are repeated as it seems to build. I do love that chorus. \"Until The End\" takes about 3 minutes before we get a fuller sound. Nasty organ after 5 1/2 minutes. An epic section is followed by a relaxed piece of piano and acoustic guitar. Reserved vocals join in to end it. <p> I'll touch briefly on the bonus disc. \"Knucklehead\" is the heaviest tune on here and the mellotron is fantastic! \"1312 Overture\" begins and ends with orchestral music but for me it's the music in between that satisfies the most. Lots of intensity and mellotron. \"Constellations\" might be the best track overall. Check out the drumming and mellotron early on. It makes me feel alive. It ends like it began. Just wow! \"Fall And Rise\" has some interesting sounds like banjo(I think) and other intricate sounds. A beautiful tune. \"Ten Million Demons\" is one I loved from the start. Heavy with mellotron and quite catchy. This has such a good mid-tempo groove to it. \"Hardcore\" is my least favourite tune on here but it's still a really good one. <p> So I would rate this above their previous album \"Frequency\" but below \"Dark Matter\". This really is a grower for me and if it continues i'd give it 4.5 stars but for now a very solid 4 stars. Highlights are the bass, drums and mellotron.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1196743#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1196743\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1196743\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, June 21, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1196743)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9836\"><strong>tszirmay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9836\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/9836/Roxy.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe Return of the Choir Mellotron <p>For all its worth, any IQ album is subject to a vast array of opinions, going from \r\n\"masterpiece\" to \"I don't get it!\", an entirely understandable state of affairs when considering \r\nthe pioneering legacy this band continues to enjoy. Yup, we all know the story, they were \r\npart of the heroic resistance to the impending disappearance of prog in 1977, when 'vanilla' \r\npunk ruled the hypocritical waves. Along with Marillion, Pallas, Twelfth Night and Pendragon, \r\nIQ forged ahead in the vast darkness. Each subsequent album has made an impact on the \r\nexpectations from these wily veterans and releases such as Ever, The Seventh House, Dark \r\nMatter and Frequency have injected pride and passion into the flourishing scene, giving the \r\nlesser known bands a new source of inspiration and drive. Music for music's sake. The \r\ndeparture of the visually delightful master bassist John Jowitt, original keyboard virtuoso \r\nMartin Orford and drummer Andy Edwards did not really affect the sound all that much as \r\nnew faces and old hats are now in the fold (Tim Esau and Paul Cook are back from their \r\nsabbatical). It seems that, like it or not, guitarist Mike Holmes remains the man responsible \r\nfor the overall IQ sound and Peter Nicholls just stamps the lyrics with his theatrical voice. \r\nThey also seem to take their time in getting new material done in a fashion that will keep old \r\nfans happy while seducing a new audience. Neo-pro, for all its opinionated shortcomings, \r\nhas never produced more gems than in the last 10 years, a sub-genre that has been killing \r\nit with superlative new groups (Silhouette, Galahad, Anubis, Sylvan, Comedy of Errors, \r\nMagenta, Final Conflict, Shamall, Vienna Circle and a slew of others). Every day seems to \r\nannounce a new arrival from France, Italy, Holland, Germany, Sweden, Chile, Argentina, \r\nBrazil, Norway and beyond. So, in all fairness to others, IQ are the shining light that keeps \r\nthe prog road illuminated, intelligent music woven by supreme talents who have a peculiar \r\nvision of their sound, yet constantly look to reinvent themselves. That alone warrants the \r\nloftiest praise. <p>Like most avid fans, I have opted for the 2 CD version (the more music, the merrier) and \r\neverything expected is reached in spades, with a package that will have fans and critics all \r\ncaught up in their own personal interpretations, slicing, dicing and otherwise finding \r\nwhatever they are looking for in a prog album. Yes, the mood reflects the somber cover \r\nartwork, a mist of swirling greys with an understood melancholic gloom that may appear out \r\nof nowhere, unexpected. Neil Durant is the main architect of creative keyboard work that \r\nsees little interest in technical prowess, completely subservient to the crew and their \r\narrangement. <p>CD 1 - \"From the Outside In\" intros with a Bela Lugosi accented \"Children of the Night\" and \r\nsubsequent steamroller assault on the senses, crisp, heavy and actually closer to recent \r\nGalahad. From the opening chords, the mighty Mellotron has opted for the much vaunted \r\nchoir option, (a personal longtime favorite) and it has not shirked its omnipotent desire to \r\ndominate the aural landscape. Paul Cook's marshaling beats show off quasi Led Zeppelin-\r\nlike propulsion, nasty and lethal explosions of tectonic shock, Esau pulling menacingly on \r\nhis basso profundo. There is little doubt that this piece has extraordinary 'live in concert' \r\ncredentials, not just for its manifest bombast but also for its explicit winks at \"the Lamb Lies \r\nDown on Broadway\" cinematographic soundtrack. There is a gleaming metallic sheen here \r\nas well as elsewhere on the 2CD collection that should be obvious to any cursory listener. <p>If there ever was a perfect IQ song (and there are many in the back catalog), the glorious title \r\ntrack would certainly fit the billing.  It has a modern sheen, in that the keyboards have a most \r\ndefinite electro-glitter with a weighty beat and a grandiloquent presence, driving a metallic \r\nspike into the Neo-prog formula, a particular attention to forging stunning melodies adorned \r\nwith twinkling orchestrations. The main theme is typical of the IQ veneration for colossal \r\nmemorability, with a cute nod at Peter Murphy's classic \"Indigo Eyes\" there is a repetitive \r\nmarimba/calypso keyboard tone that will corrupt any indifference and induce immediate \r\n'kneeling at the shrine' hypnosis.  The massed guitar onslaught, engined forward by that \r\ntitanic Mellotron orchestration is a thing of beauty. This is progressive rock hit material. I \r\ncould listen to these 8 and a half minutes on endless loop and repeat. <p>IQ have crafted a loyal companion to their colossal epic \"Harvest of Souls\" off the Dark \r\nMatter album, though this 19 minute+ \"Without Walls\" may offer up more excitation than one \r\ncould hope for, cool breeze drumming, sounding almost like a beat box combine with \r\ndense Led Zeppelin \"Kashmir\"-like atmospherics and majestic squalls of contrasts, a \r\nuniverse of salivating organ and a snarling Rottweiler guitar tirade. Nicholls howls with \r\nunabashed despondence, floating redolence and total confidence. Obviously, there needs \r\nto be many returns here to fully grasp the density and despair but that's what makes epics \r\nso gratifying, they keep revealing new details, such as the short \"The Knife\"-like take-off that \r\nwinked at me and the sudden jangly guitar arpeggios a few seconds later, the rambling \r\nHammond urging on explosion and the delirium inducing outro, thinking that the piece is \r\nover. Durant then flips on his switches and toys with his synths, giving another round to the \r\nmicrophone man.  Beautiful, by any prog standard! Teacher, please don't leave us kids \r\nalone! <p>\"Ocean\" took a long time for me to appreciate, as this and the following piece seemed to get \r\ncaught in some invisible net. Fragile, puerile, bucolic, pastoral, it's actually a song in its \r\npurest form. In fact, I find myself comparing this to a Howard Jones/Naked Eyes/Thompson \r\nTwins electro-pop ballad. Truth is I am starting to really enjoy this track but it has been a \r\nslow-burner.  <p>We end the first installment with the underwhelming \"Until the End\", a cosmetic \r\nhodgepodge of altering nuances, a dozen minutes of intransigent drama laced with \r\nbooming bass in overt Rutherfordian upper cut, tortured synthesizer punching and \r\ncareening guitar jabs. The gritty song is initially a struggle in its performance and therefore \r\nin its acceptance but again, repeated returns have peeled off layers of tear-inducing onion, \r\nonly to discover the underlying quality of the musicianship and the singing.   <p>CD 2 - As correctly stated by numerous previous observers, this second CD is as tasty, if \r\nnot more so than the glittering first one, a real double whammy treat for the fan, the band \r\nwas obviously inspired by all the \"remue-m\u00e9nage\" going on between members leaving and \r\nold vets returning to the fold. I guess the term 'musical chairs' has never been more \r\nappropriate. The brash \"Knucklehead\" blasts with serpent-like conviction, massive dollops \r\nof buttery choir and violin Mellotron cater to the sonic buffet, with enough twists and turns to \r\nkeep us proggers on our tippy-toes.  <p>\"1312 Overture\" is studiously more orchestral than anything remotely neo-prog, a perfect \r\nexample of how rock music can be 'classicalized' and satisfy the most irascible fan. It is a \r\nhumorous and clever wink at Piotr Tchaikovsky's classic \"1812 Overture\", a piece depicting \r\nRussia's defiant defense from Napoleon's conquering Grande Armee. It has an obvious \r\nmilitary tone to it, complete with cannonade fireworks, howling winter-like Choir Mellotron \r\nand gentle yet abject surrender.   <p>The cinematographic splendor of \"Constellations\" is perhaps the most terrifyingly accurate \r\nIQ song ever, as if the lads were all born brilliant and decide to harvest their souls for added \r\ninspiration. Peter Nichols has never sounded more accomplished, compelled towards \r\nexcellence by the grandiose keyboard avalanche which in turn is propelled muscularly by \r\nboth Tim Esau's burly bass and Paul Cook's driving rhythmic pulse. Guitarist Holmes does \r\nfinally step out into the spotlight and he glitters with fluid streams of electricity, as well as \r\narranging a sure fire IQ classic in the process, including the overt Genesis influences that \r\nwe all know and love. Here, it's at its zenith in terms of successful seduction.  <p>The lovely \"Fall and Rise\" showcases Esau's exceptional fretless bass prowess (another \r\nvalued prog idiosyncrasy), deft acoustic guitar from master Holmes who is a darn good \r\nplayer, as well as Nicholls vocalizing with his usual maitrise. A pleasurable ballad that will \r\nget many more repeats from my devices. <p>When I first heard \"Ten Million Demons\" somewhat absent mindedly, I was taken slightly \r\naback as I thought that Depeche Mode had suddenly gone progressive and bullied \r\nthemselves onto this record! Just like their friends Galahad (who have been crafting quality \r\nneo-prog for 29 years now), IQ has been unafraid of infusing little hints of synth electronica, \r\na trait that has kept their respective recent releases fresh and enticing. The track again \r\nshowcases Neil Durant's keyboard command, capable to do his Tony Banks thingy as well \r\nas a mean Thomas Dolby!  <p>While we are at it, the lugubrious \"Hardcore\" does just that, incorporating tenser tendencies \r\nthat swerve near neo-gothic horizons, something wholly Wagnerian but in a more prog \r\ncontext, injecting brooding rhythms and somber motifs , and need I to repeat myself , more \r\nof that unctuous Mellotron! This hazy piece seeks out some eerie spectral environments, \r\ndaubing greyish halos on the grave and funereal accompaniment.  Another brief Esau bass \r\nroulade introduces a shattering Holmes solo, very Hacketty and Ant Phillipsy, all emotion \r\nand restraint, finishing off with a long acoustic foray.  Sublime! <p>I have always hoped for an album smothered in unending waves of my favorite progressive \r\nsound, the Choir Mellotron and truth be said, \"Road to Bones\" has enough to keep my \r\nbumps goose-ing!  Incredibly orgasmic, the music presented here will undoubtedly provide \r\nmany hours of future relaxation and high fidelity leisure. The production, the sound, the \r\nartwork and booklet are all of first rate quality, making this a necessary icon in the prog \r\npantheon, 2014 has been now officially blessed with even more golden status. <p>Prog is in good hands as long as IQ provides the Guiding Light.  <p>5 shadowy constituents\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1206435#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1206435\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1206435\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, July 6, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1206435)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI own the special edition double CD release of this album, so my review is somewhat slighted by the \"overall\" impression that this collection of songs has left me. The Road of Bones contains a lot of very polished neoprog. None of it is very sophisticated. Most of it is fairly straightforward and repetitive with the occasional pleasing twist or turn. Peter Nichols' vocals are very clear and easy on the ears yet they lack whatever it takes to get the listener really engaged and excited. \r\n      I find myself most drawn to the keyboard work--which is most often fairly simple though very lush and fully-filling of the aural landscapes. Mostly, I guess I just like the sounds and tones used by Neil Durant. \r\n     The album does have a few gems--and, IMHO, they have improved their delivery from Frequency--though many of the \"hooks\" used effectively on that 2009 album are again used here. From Disc 1, \"The Road of Bones\" (8:32) (9/10) is great, beautiful, mature. The epic/show piece \"Without Walls\" (19:16) (8/10) and the Wind and Wuthering-like \"Ocean\" (5:55) (8/10) are both nice songs but neither leaves me with adrenaline pumping, neither lures me back for the \"replay\" button push.\r\n      From Disc 2, \"Knucklehead\" (8:11) (9/10) is the best--offering the most complex and exciting music of the entire collection. Both \"Hardcore\" (the first half) (10:53) and \"Until the End\" (12:00) reminds me too much of Frequency's best song, \"Ryker Skies.\" The rest of Disc 2's songs are a step below the offerings on Disc 1. The instrumental, \"1312 Overture\" (4:18), is engaging but it makes me feel as if the band is going through a rhythmic warmup exercise. The acoustic guitar play on Disc 2 and use of programmed drums gives the music a cheesy lounge New Age music sound. \"Ten Million Demons\" (6:10) leads the best of the rest. \"Constellations\" (12:25) sounds like it came right out of Genesis' And Then There Were Three/Duke era--I mean, straight out, sometimes note and sound-for note and sound.<p>Overall, The Road of Bones is a pleasant listen even if it doesn't excite me enough to extoll its masterpiece status. Still, I do recommend prog lovers give it a listen. <p>January 29, 2025 edit: When I joined PA in 2008 there were only a handful of albums in PA's Top Prog Albums (all-time) list that had been created since 1981 (mostly from Marillion, Dream Theater, \u00c4nglag\u00e5rd, Opeth, Pain of Salvation, Riverside, and Porcupine Tree). Now there are 26. including this one.\r\n      Over the ten years since this album was released--where it shook the PA world to its core--I've revisited this poorly recorded and produced album of grossly mediocre songs numerous times, thinking \"I must be missing something\" due to all of the high ratings and praise this album has received. But, in the end, I have determined that my original assessments stand. This album by no means deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with Kind of Blue, In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson, Abraxas, Lateralus, Clutching at Straws, Nonagon Infinity, Plat du Jour, Eros, Ocean, and/or Obscura.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1218982#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1218982\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1218982\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 21, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1218982)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=19044\"><strong>Roland113</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=19044\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/19044/TheCatfishMan.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn My Not So Humble Opinion:<p>\"Frequency\" by IQ was disappointing at best.  I'm sorry IQ, I'm sorry friends of IQ, but this \r\nwas not one of their best efforts.  <p>That was the beginning of my last IQ review, a three star effort wrought with disappointment \r\nfrom one of my favorite bands laying a dud.  As such, I was less than enthusiastic about \r\n\"The Road of Bones\", it took me a while to finally give it a spin.  I had pre-judged the album, \r\nit's another IQ album similar to the last three, how can it have such a high rating.  I was \r\nprepared to come in and bash the album.<p>I was wrong, I was horribly wrong!<p>Ok, so there are similarities and differences between Frequency and The Road of Bones.  \r\nFor starters, both albums have the harder edge that's been going through the ranks of Neo \r\nas of late, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The difference is that the engineering has \r\ntaken a leap, the mix sounds so much better.  Peter Nichols voice shines through as \r\nalways, but Neil Durant's keyboard is some of the best that IQ has seen in years, including \r\nsome of the later albums with Martin Orford.  Another huge improvement is the rhythm \r\nsection of Tim Esau and Paul Cook.  It's both the new and old rhythm section, but they \r\nsound fantastic together and again, the mix makes them sound even better.  Certainly not \r\nforgotten, Mike Holmes continues to rip out fantastic solo after solo.  The occasional \r\ninfluence of a Spanish acoustic here and there is greatly appreciated.<p>\"From the Outside In\" is a typical IQ song and honestly, when I first heard it, I was convinced \r\nthat this was just a continuation of the latest trend.  After multiple listening's it still leaves me \r\nunderwhelmed, <p>The title track is one of the first tunes that really hit me as something different.  I love the \r\ndistinctive sound of the vibraphone line standing out amongst the ambience of the rest of \r\nthe synths.  Neil Durant paints a beautiful soundscape here.  Towards the middle of the \r\nsong we get a glimpse of Tim Easu's tasty fretless bass (mmm, tasty bass. . . ).  This is a \r\ngreat departure, something fresh and new.  <p>\"Without Walls\" is a full on nineteen minutes of hit and miss.  Ok, that's an exaggeration, the \r\nfirst three minutes is a forgettable, Genesis-esque ballad that could have been tucked away \r\non \"We Can't Dance\".  Luckily, this is quickly discarded for a nod to Frequency with the heavy \r\ntriple chunk of the guitar over the Kashmir style drums.  This is the IQ that we're used to, \r\nand I'm not saying this as a bad thing, I like change, but there still needs to be a common \r\npoint of reference.<p>Neil Durant wears his Tony Banks influence on his sleeves, particularly for the keyboard \r\nlines in \"Ocean\".  I kind of like Ocean as a ballad, though it is nonetheless, a ballad, a \r\nrelatively underappreciated vessel in the prog sphere.  Peter Nichols' voice stands out as \r\nmore emotional and vulnerable than usual, a pleasant departure.<p>\"Until the End\" has some bright spots as well, the part at the five minute mark is a wonderful \r\nstudy in tastiness and space.  Paul Cook in particular sounds great here.  The end of the \r\nsong is typical of IQ in that it's a slow reflection back on the past few songs, but unlike the \r\nprevious albums, this one is slightly less predictable in that it's slower and quieter.  Rather \r\nthan making the big statement ala \"Guiding Light\" or \"The Narrow Margin\" this one tapers off \r\nnicely.<p>So, at this point we're at the end of the first CD and I'm waffling between a high three or a \r\nlow four, it's good but I'm not convinced it's the next masterpiece.  On to disc two.<p>\"Knucklehead\" has an exotic, almost Indian feel to it, the rhythm section shines throughout \r\nthe first few minutes with a flurry of accent hits.  Some of Mike Holmes best guitar work can \r\nbe heard throughout this song, first there's the acoustic part that ends the Indian section, \r\nfollowed by a case of the heavies and then a nice arpeggio.  The rhythm section again \r\nshines throughout this entire song.  This song is a nice improvement over the first disc and \r\nreally got my attention.<p>\"1312 Overture\" just plain kicks butt the whole way throughout the song, we start with a nice \r\nreference to the 1812 overture then there's four minutes of instrumental bliss featuring Neil \r\nDurant showcasing his talents over a sick rhythm.  This is another great song.<p>\"Constellations\" is a Genesis themed song with similar themes to the last two songs, Tony \r\nBanks sounding keyboard patches with Mike Holmes doubling at times, or soloing over \r\nthem at other times.  This is the third fantastic song in a row and I'm starting to feel this \r\nalbum.<p>\"Fall and Rise\" is another beautiful song and Tim Esau shines here, the warbling of his \r\nfretless intertwining with Paul Cook's meandering drumming is sublime.  Just when it's all \r\nwell and good, Mike Holmes rips out a Spanish sounding acoustic guitar solo that meshes \r\nbeautifully with Peter Nichols voice.  This is another song about musical space and \r\nsomething that's been sorely missed on the last couple of IQ albums.  In case that isn't \r\nenough, Neil Durant takes us out with his own beautiful solo.  This band is firing on all \r\ncylinders in this song.<p>I can't say enough about \"Ten Million Demons\".  It starts out with a Dr. Who nod for the bass \r\nand just builds to an intense rocker.  I can't say enough about Neil Durant, his patch choice \r\nthroughout this song was the final kicker that pushed the cd to masterpiece status, at times \r\nhe pulls a patch from 'Mama', other times just a wonderfully tasty chord progression with a \r\nsoft pad behind the pounding groove.  The important thing though, is that this song is \r\nfantastic thanks to Mr. Durant.  I can't play this song loud enough.  Yes, this is the moment \r\nthat pushes this album to a full five star rating.  Best line of the album, Peter Nichols \r\ngrowling 'Get yourself unwrecked, time to resurrect'.<p>Hardcore is a great ending to the whole CD, we get five minutes of nod to the first CD, nice, \r\nmore Neil Durant keys in the vein of ' . . . And Then There Were Three\" but then something \r\namazing happens.  We get into a soft, outro with just soft keys and ambience.  This slowly \r\ngrows into a full out outro similar to \"Fall and Rise\" in that the instrumentalists of the band \r\nare shining and locking in together.  Mike Holmes adds first a Hacket sounding solo then \r\nanother acoustic solo over the groove as the song slowly fades out.  This was such a \r\nbeautiful ending.<p>I am so happy to give this cd a full on five star rating and so glad to see something this good \r\nfrom IQ.  This is the best album that they've ever released.  Good job to you all, this is a \r\nmasterpiece and I'm so glad you guys kept working at this band.

I didn't think IQ were going to get anywhere near as masterful as \"Ever\", or for that matter, to \r\nreach the heights of the brilliant \"Frequency\", but \"The Road of Bones\" tops the lot, and that is no mean feat given the quality of IQ's \r\nback catalogue. This album continues to showcase the star quality of Peter Nicholls powerful melodic vocals and the incredible \r\nguitar playing of Mike Holmes. The rhythm is a powerhouse factory with Tim Esau's bass and Paul Cook's drums. However the real \r\nstandout for me on this album is the extraordinary keyboard wizardry of Neil Durant. He is a revelation to this current lineup. It is a \r\nstunning collaborative effort from all involved. <p>The tracks are only 5 in total but they are all killer and no filler. The album has an immediate impact on the listener that they are \r\nhearing something very passionate and special, but the greatest thing about the album is it grows on you and simply gets better and \r\nbetter with every listen. There is a bonus album and these tracks are excellent too. Perhaps it could have been a 2 CD set. Still as a \r\nbonus album there are some delights for those who can get it, such as 'Knucklehead', 'Constellations' and 'Hardcore '. <p>It is an instant classic with Nicholls' vocals precisely executed on every note and the lead guitar breaks are dazzling and at times \r\nemotional such as 'Oceans'. Also the melodies are so infectious that it feels like it might be listening to IQs greatest hits. indeed \r\nsome of their greatest hits are here such as the epic 'Without Walls', 'From the Outside In ' and the title track. All five songs have a \r\nquality and mesmerising hypnotic essence of their own. It's a concept album about a serial killer's mind and it's dark in content but \r\nthe music is more upbeat and lively than the themes themselves. <p>This is definitely an album that will take some beating but I believe IQ are able to, given their wonderful lineup at this point in their \r\ncareer.  I can't wait to hear some of the songs live in concert on a DVD or perhaps a live CD release coming up soon hopefully. \r\nIQ remain one of the quintessential Neo Prog artists on the planet and this album certainly proves that they are far from losing their \r\ncreative and innovative spark. It is simply a wonderful album on every level. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1365580#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1365580\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1365580\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, February 9, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1365580)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5589\"><strong>The Crow</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5589\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5589/diesiraebox_sheetmusic041.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nTalking about a band with so much prestige, if I have to say that an album is their best to date that's a big deal...<p>But this is just what Road of Bones is.

And talking about a double CD release, that's an extra point! <p>The rhythmic section is perfect, Holmes is so elegant and gifted as ever, the keyboards are awesome, modern and not \r\nso old-school like most of the Neo-Prog bands, and Peter Nichols...

Should I continue?<p>Conclusion: Road of Bones is not perfect. It contains an average song (Hardcore), some good ones (Ten Million Demos, \r\nKnucklehead, 1312 Overture) and a bunch of great ones (the rest). But it's really rewarding to hear a band with more \r\nthan 30 years of history in such a great form, releasing their most complete, mature and well-made album to date.<p>For this reason and for the outstanding musical quality of Road of Bones, I'm giving this effort five solid stars, being \r\none of the best Neo-Prog albums of all times.<p>My rating: *****\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2054926#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2054926\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2054926\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, November 12, 2018</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2054926)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nVery few bands have the ability to continue to improve after three decades on the scene, but the\r\nneo-prog legend IQ is no ordinary band for sure. Forged in the early prog revival scene of the early\r\n80s, this band has consistently delivered one compelling album after another with only a few speed\r\nbumps on the way ('Are You Sitting Comfortably' = puke icon). Part of this surely has to do with IQ\r\nonly releasing a new product roughly once every five years so the band takes the proper time to make\r\nsure that all the t's are crossed and all i's dotted as they forge a new fine-tuned slab of 21st\r\ncentury neo-prog. <p>Following 2009's 'Frequency,' the band returned in 2014 with its 11th studio album THE ROAD OF BONES\r\nwhich resulted in a major lineup and change of the guard. Firstly, Neil Durant replaced Mark\r\nWestworth on keyboards as well as the return of original members Paul Cook on drums and Tim Esau on\r\nbass. Esau hadn't played on an IQ album since 1989's 'Are You Sitting Comfortably?,' an album so bad\r\nthat i can understand why he wanted to jump ship as it was sinking. Remarkably though IQ returned to\r\nform with 1993's 'Ever' and has delivered a consistent neo-prog canon ever since. While the band may\r\nhave absorbed former members on THE ROAD OF BONES, the stylistic approach is not retro at all and\r\ninstead finds the band expanding its horizons.<p>THE ROAD OF BONES was released in two formats. Firstly as a single album that contained five tracks\r\nwith a running time of just over 53 minutes and also as a double album with the second disc adding\r\nan extra six tracks bringing the total running time to over 102 minutes and thus practically\r\ndoubling the playing time. A wise decision however for those of us who didn't do our homework before\r\nour purchase didn't realize the double disc option and mistakenly ordered the single disc. While\r\nthis may sound sufficient for the casual listener, for the hardcore IQ fan, this two disc version is\r\ndefinitely the way to go as there is no quality decline between the discs. In fact, the second disc\r\nexplores even more possibilities that evolve the neo-prog paradigm into brave new worlds.<p>While many components of IQ's sound are a given such as Peter Nicholls' melancholic vocal style\r\nlamenting narrations about dark and depressing subject matter, the musical components of IQ's sound\r\ntook a leap forward with THE ROAD OF BONES. Not only is the music darker and noticeably softer than\r\nprevious albums but the instrumentation is more varied with the interplay between instruments\r\ncrafting new variations of possibilities. Firstly the drumming and percussive parts of Paul Cook\r\nhave taken things to a new level. IQ's percussive drive on previous albums has been chiefly\r\nsubordinate to the melodic flow and overall thematic nature of the subject matter but on this album\r\nhis drumming skills actually provide the leading role in many cases upon which many of the intricate\r\nmelodies and counterpoints follow.<p>To sum up THE ROAD OF BONES is quite simple. It's a lengthy sprawl of epic tracks that displays a\r\ndecorative display of various rhythms, melodies and dynamics but is held together by the\r\ngravitational pull of Peter Nicholls' distinct fragile vocal style which narrates an impending tale\r\nof emotional gloom designed to unleash all the tearjerking emotional tugs. Overall the album is more\r\natmospheric and less on the heavy rock side of the equation but the album does start off with some\r\nheavy rock bombast on 'From The Outside In' as well as on the title track at key moments before\r\ndrifting into a more ethereal ambient realm. The track 'Without Walls' covers all grounds with a\r\nsprawling run of over 19 minutes as it wends and winds through classic IQ developments and\r\nunexpected detours.<p>With a darkness and consistency virtually unmatched since Marillioin's 80s reign as top neo-prog\r\ndogs, THE ROAD OF BONES provides an excellent display of melancholic thematic material wrapped in an\r\nexcellent musical package. The tracks are more varied, the instrumental interplay is highly\r\ndeveloped and the unique mastery of atmospheres seamlessly blending with the melodic flow and range\r\nof dynamics displays IQ at the top of its game. While the single disc version provides many new\r\nideas forged, the second disc is even more liberal in allowing experimental touches to come out of\r\nthe background and become the dominant features in some cases. Amazingly THE ROAD OF BONES retains a\r\nhigh level of professionalism and song quality throughout its run and that's including the second\r\ndisc in that equation. Add to that an impeccable production job and you have a neo-prog classic. The\r\nonly complaint i have about most IQ albums in general is that Nicholls' vocal style can become a bit\r\nmonotonous at times. If his range was as dynamic as the instrumentation the album would be much\r\nricher but even as is, this is an excellent slice of prog.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2278895#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2278895\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2278895\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, November 7, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2278895)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ is arguably the most prolific neo-prog group of the 21th century so far. I started listening to 'The Road of \r\nBones' after I got hooked on its follow-up 'Resistance' from 2019. Both these albums have a full second disc of \r\nstrong B-material, which brings the playtime of this album over the 100 minutes. <p>'The Road of Bones' album (the first disc) offers a gentle, adult and well-produced version of IQ that seems \r\nespecially keen on honoring and up-dating its debut album 'Tales From the Lush Attic'. References to 'The Last \r\nHuman Gateway' can be found in choice of sounds, chord progressions and how the compositions flow. There is \r\nlots of atmospheric spaciousness in these compositions and little of the rock/metal density that for instance \r\n'Dark Matter' from 2004 offers. The compositions are given the space to evolve and there's relatively little \r\ninstrumental keyboard melodies/progressions or guitar-leads for an IQ album. The album has some bleaker \r\nmoments in which Peter Nicholls sings in a lamenting tone (the title track comes to mind), but overall the album \r\ndoesn't offer much the sci-fi doom that would dominate 'Resistance'. By referencing to their early period and \r\nadding a layer of adult atmospheric growth (like Pink Floyd would do on The Division Bell) the band has found \r\nitself a renewed interest from the broad progressive community. I myself am not blown away by this first disc, \r\nbecause I think its beautiful content is a bit spread out. IQ sounds extremely well-versed in advanced symphonic \r\nprogrock, but in the meanwhile looses some of its spontaneous edge. <p>The second disc is quite the opposite. Notably less detailed in its production (though the quality of the sound is \r\nequally good), it shows the band experimenting with drum-loops, drones, sound samples, heavy prog, electronic \r\nsoundscapes and a more diverse type of song-writing. The compositions are less finished and refined, but the \r\nchord progressions and melodies are more to my liking here; more nerve-wrecking, dark and abstract. This is IQ \r\nin its free-thinking mode and it really triggers my attention, for it makes the music that less predictable. <p>I think the combining of the finesse of the first disc and the experimental side of the second disc of 'The Road of \r\nBones' is what makes 'Resistance' one my favorite albums ever made. For this album I can highly recommend the \r\n2cd version that should offer more than enough neo-prog delight for all fans of IQ. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2419974#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2419974\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2419974\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, July 16, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2419974)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8096\"><strong>Tarcisio Moura</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8096\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/8096/unspoken_Whisper.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI must say it took me a long time really enjoy this album. At the time I got The Road Of Bones I had also had bought several others CDs and I guess others pleased me more at first listen, so I sest this one aside for a while. And everytime I took the trouble to listen to it again I was not captivated by the first two tracks,and I usually ended my session right there. It just sounded too much like Subterranea or The Seventh House, not my favorite IQ stuff. That kept happening until recently, when, by mistake, I put the second CD on and was amazed of how good it sounded. The bonus material was much better than the \"official\" one, or at least that\u00b4s what I thought then. Nowadays, after repeated spins,I discovered that the whole work is one of their very best.<p>I guess this CD was a challenge for the band, being the first one to be completely written without founder member Martin Orford .And I did not know at the time that not even Orford\u00b4s replacement on the previous Frequency (2009), Mark Westworth, was gone and newcomer Neil Durant had taken over keyboards duties! On the other hand, original members Paul Cook (drums) and Tim Esau (bass) are back, thus meaning that 4/5 of the classic line up is playing here! And both are on top form, with Esau showing great bass lines here, specially when he plays some fretless bass. <p>What really amazes me the most if the fact that this is surely a keyboards driven record, with novice Neil Durant taking a major role on this record. Although his style is not exactly the same as Orfords, his extensive use of vintage sounding keyboards, along with few more \"modern\" stuff, gives the tracks an unmistaken IQ feeling on all tracks, and yet he also brings some fresh and exciting new tones and colors to the music. He is the main figure here. The downside is the fact that Michael Holmes trademark, tasteful guitar solos for some reason are few and far between. The Road of Bones would be a five star record if he had add more of that on this album.<p>As for the songs themselves, this is a killer album, with only winners and no fillers. Their sound is becoming more and more complex and symphonic, even if still melodic and accessible. The first CD is a concept album about a serial killer and that\u00b4s the one that takes more time to really sink in, but it\u00b4s a magnificent work, while the bonus disc is, at least, as good as the official one. It\u00b4s hard to pont out a highlight since the quality of the stuff is so high and varied. But I must say that the 19 minute epic Without Walls is defintely one, while Constellations and Until The End are also favorites. But, nowadays, I always hear them both from start to finish now without skipping a single track. The production is excellent, as are the arrangements and performances. <p>Conclusion: One of the best IQ CDs,ever. If it was not for the lack of more Michael Holmes guitar solos this could be their very best. But a brilliant and inspired  opus that will please anyone who likes great synmphonic prog music. 4,5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2436411#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2436411\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2436411\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, August 9, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=45042#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2436411)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=56081\"><strong>VianaProghead</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=56081\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/1/cover_404762112008.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" title=\"VianaProghead avatar\" width=100 alt=\"VianaProghead avatar\" onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n                                    Review N\u00ba 684<p>Few things could be as exciting to a prog rock fan, including myself, than a new IQ album, especially considering \r\nthey take some time to releasing them. They're one of the few remaining prog rock acts to have truly grown and \r\nimproved with each release, or at least, their last releases hit a peak of quality very close but hard to outdo of \r\ntheir albums \"Ever\", \"The Seventh House\", \"Subterranea\" and \"Dark Matter\". They're all great examples of the \r\nbest prog, expertly mingling heartfelt emotion with a complex but eminently melodic musical sensibility. IQ is my \r\nfavourite British prog band today.<p>Since their beginnings in the 80's they've been dubbed neo-prog for their borrowing of the prevalent symphonic \r\nand emotional tendencies of some 70's bands like Genesis. They play prog rock in a comfortable and \r\natmospheric way. Their synth rich style generates an atmosphere that gravitates around spacey sounds as much \r\nas the symphonic, incorporating the two into long and extended backdrops before which the well defined \r\nrhythms proceed in due course. But, the most obvious is the vocal performance of Peter Nicholls. In terms of \r\nmood his unique style is difficult to describe, it's not quite downcast and not uplifting, but seems to find a stable \r\nand comforting temperament in-between.<p>Thus, after five years of waiting, the UK progressive rock legend, IQ, a band who have worked hard at keeping \r\nthe \"second wave of prog\" from the early 80's alive now for over thirty years, returned with their eleventh studio \r\nalbum \"The Road Of Bones\", which was released in 2014. It's the first album to feature Neil Durant on keyboards \r\nand it marks the return of original members Paul Cook on drums and Tim Esau on bass, the latter appearing on \r\nan IQ album for the first time since 1989. So, the line up on \"The Road Of Bones\" is Peter Nicholls (lead and \r\nbacking vocals), Mike Holmes (guitars), Neil Durant (keyboards), Tim Esau (bass guitars and bass pedals) and \r\nPaul Cook (drums and percussion).<p>There are two versions of the album, the single and the limited version. The single version has five tracks. \"From \r\nThe Outside In\" is a great opener full of power. Opening with suitably spooky atmospheric synths, things soon \r\nget going with some solid pumping bass lines backed by synth flourishes and Peter's voice cutting through it all. \r\nThere's more atmospherics to come, before a return to the pumping rhythms. This is a great sign of things to \r\ncome. \"The Road Of Bones\" is the title track. It starts quiet and really builds to a climax. It has a new slow burner \r\nopening again with synths and piano. This is a particularly haunting track, and Peter's lyrics and vocals are \r\nastounding. The slow understated bass driven take us to an amazing tension all over the song. This is a \r\nwonderful track that showcases IQ's talent for building tension in their music. It's one of IQ's finest tracks, \r\nindeed. \"Without Walls\" is the first long track clocking it at nineteen minutes. It starts simple with piano and a \r\ndrum machine, and again it builds and builds. There are some nice sections and some good soloing all over it. \r\nThe first couple of minutes are very simple but during its nineteen minutes it morphs several times and ends up \r\ngoing all over the place quite brilliantly. This is actually quite common right across the album, which is what \r\nmakes it so appealing. There's always something unexpected around the corner. \"Ocean\" is a pleasant song with \r\na nice chorus. It's the shortest track on the album and one of the less energetic. But, there's power, warmth and \r\nintricacy that carries it along quite nicely to a satisfying conclusion. All in all, this is a pleasant track and a good \r\nbreather between the two most epic tracks on the album. \"Until The End\" starts with a haunting theme that \r\ntakes us to an intense musical journey. This is another stunner with plenty of atmospherics and an amazing \r\nperformance by all band's members. It's another highlight, an unexpected way to close the album with a very \r\nrefreshing ending, indeed.<p>I must admit that I bought the limited version and I really enjoyed the second disc as well. Some of the material \r\nis very strong, but it's quite evident why the tracks were left out of the album, as they don't seem to keep the \r\ncomposure throughout the duration, most of the time. Still, the material is better than most bands' best tracks. \r\nAnd that's saying a lot, indeed. IQ must be one of the best choosers of tracks for albums and many prog rock \r\nbands could learn something with them about trimming down albums. We don't need 80 minute albums if half \r\nof the music seems unfinished or raw.<p>Conclusion: It's hard to believe a band keeping getting better and more ambitious with each release after thirty \r\nyears of career, but IQ does it. In every aspect, from the choice of sounds to the lyrics not forgetting the \r\nperformances, this is a work of true masters. IQ has lost nothing with the personnel changes. In fact I think \r\nthey're probably a tighter unit, both musically and as a band. As I said before, the sound quality is excellent and \r\nthe playing is some of the best IQ has produced. \"The Road Of Bones\" first disk alone is a garden of melodic \r\ndelights, unquestionably one of the best musical rides that we can get, but that wasn't enough for IQ. They had \r\nto throw a second disc. The second disk would have suited quite well on its own as the new album. Still, the first \r\nalbum is definitely the more cohesive listening experience.<p>Prog is my Ferrari.
