After the disappointing (), which mostly \r\nwas a bunch of long jams that bored me to tears (the first four/five tracks were quite good), SR have \r\nrefocussed and produced an album that at least matches the quality of AB, their breakthrough. The \r\nsongs can be lengthy still, but they are tightly written and feature less of the stereotypical loud- \r\nbeginning-to-chaotic-ending structures that plague a lot of spacey bands. Fragments of the melodies \r\nstick in my head long after they are gone, something that couldn't be said about (), with the exception of \r\na couple of tracks. The vocals are still the group's greatest strength- there's nothing quite like them that \r\nI've heard, still sounding like a demented boys' choir! But the heavy use of strings is back, and even some \r\noom-pah pah horns used to playful effect. The delay-drenched guitars are given lots of room to breathe- \r\nin fact, the use of space is wonderful. Ringing notes go on for bars on end, adding to the contemplative \r\natmosphere.

Of course - it's partially true - S.R. (unlike R.h.) usually prefer the \r\nunderground circuits, but for me it's better for them to choose the small gigs in order to \r\nmaintain their artistic impact (nevertheless I remember the Last Summer show at Villa \r\nArconati -Bollate near Milano- in the course of july 2005, in which they appreciated the \r\nenthusiastic feedback of the Italian people very much!!...). The track \"Milano\" -for \r\ninstance- is right dedicated to my city, in which every intelligent music fan often wants \r\nto \"buy\" a different kind of music and S.R. can satisfy such an important exigency: a great \r\ncharming mood, a visionary soft music - a bit melancholic - but always intelligent. Their \r\npurpose is clear in all the other tracks and as for this reason their album \"Takk\" is not only \r\nfor the lovers of the \"Borealis\" atmosphere from Iceland.to be collected if you're into the \r\nbest experimental post rock anyway, even thoug actually it should be worth a \"3 stars and an half\" righter score, in comparison to the best albums of progressive music!!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=52924#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=52924\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=52924\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 23, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #52924)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1236\"><strong>FloydWright</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSome of you are probably glad that because this is a near-instrumental album, I won't\r\nbe rambling on <strong>quite</strong> as much as usual.  Anyway, the great news about\r\n<em>Takk...</em> is that while there are still a lot of the same noises heard in their\r\nunfortunate EP release <em>Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do</em>, there's much more to hold this\r\ntogether, and a faster beat than <em>( )</em> (which seems dead in many places) at most\r\ntimes.  This is closer to their masterpiece <em>Agaetis Byrjun</em> in spirit, and more\r\naccessible.  In fact, some of the instruments that made <em>Agaetis Byrjun</em> so\r\ngreat reappear on <em>Takk</em>,  such as the horns on \"Hopp\u00edpola\"/\"Me\u00f0 Bl\u00f3\u00f0nasir\" and\r\nthe strings of \"S\u00e9 Lest\".  Even though \"S\u00e9 Lest\" also has some of the strange\r\nbackground noises from BBTKDD, SIGUR ROS seems to understand this time that's not\r\nenough to have an actual song.<p>Some of the lyrics are in Icelandic, and others are still in Hopelandic, but there's\r\nfar, far less of a feeling of obscurity for obscurity's sake.  What's also\r\ninteresting is to look up translations to the lyrics.  I was surprised to find that\r\nunlike some of their more depressing compositions, \"Saegl\u00f3pur\" actually had happy\r\nlyrics, which succinctly tells the story of a sailor thought dead being found and\r\nrescued.  Not all of them are that way, when I looked on websites for the\r\ntranslations, but even one is an unusual thing from SIGUR ROS.  Some of the\r\ncompositions seem to flow together as if they were a single entity, like\r\n\"Takk\"/\"Gl\u00f3s\u00f3li\" and \"Hopp\u00edpola\"/\"Me\u00f0 Bl\u00f3\u00f0nasir\", so don't let a few short track\r\ntimes fool you--these are fully-developed songs.<p>SIGUR ROS does break new ground on this album, most particularly on \"Saegl\u00f3pur\",\r\n\"Gong\", and some on \"Svo Hjl\u00f3tt\", where we get an unheard-of, fast-paced drumming\r\nstyle that avoids letting songs linger like they did on <em>( )</em>.  I'm certainly\r\nnot talking about metal-style drumming (though on Track 8 of <em>( )</em> they got\r\nclose once), but something a little more like old \"Myrkur\" on <em>Von</em>--though at\r\nmuch better quality.  And even the old reliable SIGUR ROS pieces like \"M\u00edlan\u00f3\" and\r\n\"Andvari\" are up to speed.<p>The one drawback to this whole album is the distorted quality to some of the\r\ninstruments (drums and piano in particular) that makes the production quite a bit\r\nless impressive than on <em>Agaetis Byrjun</em>.  Also, there are times when I feel\r\nlike the end to \"Andvari\" drags a bit, but it depends on my mood.  However, the\r\nsongwriting is up to par--and furthermore, is actually <strong>happy</strong> for the most\r\npart.  One wonders if the title (Icelandic for \"Thank you\") is SIGUR ROS' way of\r\nsaying, \"Thank you for bearing with us\" through the doldrums of BBTKDD and <em>(\r\n)</em>.  Overall, a 4.5, and if not for the distracting sound-quality issues, this\r\nwould be the equal of <em>Agaetis Byrjun</em>.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=60626#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=60626\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=60626\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, December 17, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #60626)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIf I was highly impressed with the previous unnamed album, I must recognize that I am \r\nrather disappointed with this one. A superb and lavish, highly luxurious artwork sleeve \r\nhad more than piqued my curiosity, and everything suggested that this was going to \r\nbe a masterpiece. <p>While hardly a bad album, we are in for a repeat album of the previous with its rather \r\ndifficult singing and incomprehensible lyric (Hopelandic), but with an added irritating \r\ntwist. If you take away the vocal parts, this album sounds A LOT to GYBE! And this is \r\nmore than an impression, too. The still slow-paced tracks still have a very melancholic \r\nfeel (so typical of Northern or Scandinavian Europe) and a eerie beauty, but \r\nunfortunately, I feel that there is a certain step backwards with this album, and \r\nclearly when the whole group is playing at full volume (this is NOT a metal group, \r\nthough), these guys sound a lot like the Montrealers and most other groups that are \r\nstarting to crowd in that now too-used formula of Post-Rock. BTW: if I compare most \r\npost-rock groups to GYBE!, it is mainly because the nonet first pioneered this \"sound\" \r\nand influenced all of the others.  <p>Don't get me wrong here, not everything is borrowed (far from it) on this album, and \r\nthere are plenty of moments where you find the \"old\" Sigur, in fine form. But as I said \r\nabove, the surprise and expectation raised after ( ), probably proved too much for this \r\nIcelandic trio to live up to. Still a good album, though.

I really know nothing about Sigur R\u00f3s \r\nthough.  I only bought this album because I recognized the band's name from \r\nreading about them from time to time on Progarchives.  Turns out this was a good \r\ninvestment of my limited discretionary income.  <p>The lyrics, what few there are, are mostly unintelligible, either because they are \r\nsung in what I assume to be Icelandic, or just because the words are secondary to \r\nthe music itself.  For these guys, this is not a bad thing, as their sound is certainly \r\nappealing and actually kind of cheerful.  The cover and liner artwork and lettering \r\nare exquisite, what I think may be a woodblock and ink painting.  There aren't \r\nmany modern albums around today with such a timeless and mature look to them.<p>\"Takk.\" is an airy little intro to the rest of the album, and it transitions after just \r\na couple of minutes into \"Gl\u00f3s\u00f3li\", a well-developed, largely instrumental song that \r\nreminds me at various points of Godspeed You Black Emperor!, particularly the \r\nsecond half of F#a# Infinity.  The song starts slowly and is quite mellow, but builds to \r\na crescendo in the middle that is very much a Godspeed trademark.  Also a bit like \r\nSet Fire to Flames, but less depressing.<p>\"Hopp\u00edpolla\" is mostly a piano/strings piece, again with the ethereal and \r\nunintelligible vocals that neither add nor detract from it.  Apparently the song is \r\nabout celebrating life by prancing around in the rain, falling down and getting a \r\nbloody nose, and then getting back up and does it again.  Odd theme, but the music \r\nis upbeat.<p>\"Me\u00f0 Bl\u00f3\u00f0nasir\" is a short work that features some warm, fat guitar chords, \r\nchant/humming, and the ubiquitous bell sounds that permeate the entire album.  It \r\ntransitions into \"S\u00e9 Lest\", a lengthy, bells-and-strings spacey instrumental that \r\nagain is somewhat reminiscent of bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor!, but in \r\nthis case quite a bit softer than most of their works.<p>\"S\u00e6gl\u00f3pur\" is the Sigur R\u00f3s version of \"A Perfect Storm\" or \"The Wreck of the \r\nEdmund Fitzgerald\", only with a happier ending.  The song starts out with very slow \r\nand precise piano, some light bells (synthetic, I expect), and the repetitive verse \r\nthat is either Icelandic, or just made up.  This represents a calm sea upon which a \r\nboat is sailing, I think.  The song builds into a more driving gale wind of guitars and \r\ndrums, probably intended to represent an ocean storm upon which the boat is \r\ntossed and apparently crashes and sinks, upon which the plodding piano returns, \r\nalong with the nonsensical lyrics.  The man in the boat is lost at sea.. but is \r\nsomehow rescued and returns home - \"Alive, has returned home.  A lost seafarer, \r\nalive\".  Finally, the song fades to black.<p>\"M\u00edlan\u00f3\" is the longest track on the album, clocking in at more than ten minutes, \r\nalthough the first three minutes or so are no more than sporadic piano and those \r\ndarn bells, slowly building up to the introduction of a slow, plodding drumbeat and \r\nfaint background guitar.  Again, the lyrics make no sense, and I suspect they \r\nwouldn't even if I knew Icelandic.  By this time I've decided that singer J\u00f3nsi \r\nBirgission is something of a Scandinavian Neil Young.  Again, I know nothing of this \r\nband, but somehow I get the impression he wouldn't mind the comparison.  If their \r\nmusic is any indication, these guys are probably pretty laid back.  After a brief \r\nbuild-up, the song returns to the languid piano wanderings, interrupted by a couple \r\nmore similar short crescendos before winding to a close.  This song actually reminds \r\nme a lot of some of those little jewelry music boxes with the little ballerinas that my \r\nsister had when she was a kid.  Quite pleasant, non-threatening, and mildly \r\nfunctional.<p>The vocals on \"Gong\" reinforce my impression that the singer is possibly even \r\nattempting to sound like Neil Young, with that high-but-not-feminine lilt that sounds \r\nas if the man behind the voice could easily lose touch with reality altogether with \r\nvery little effort.  At times this song is more aggressive and mainstream than \r\nanything else on the album.  I don't know if bands get the same types of pressures \r\nin Iceland to deliver radio-friendly material, but if they do than this song is probably \r\nthe one that was done to shut label executives up.<p>The \"Andvari\" tune is a bit like those sleep-through-hypnosis tapes, very slow, \r\ncalm, and peaceful.  I'm listening to this one right now, and am seriously considering \r\ntaking a bit of a nap.  This song is pleasant, but it seems to take forever to wind its \r\nway to a close.<p>\"Svo Hlj\u00f3tt\" is also slow, but a bit more brooding than its predecessor.  There's also \r\na sustained aggressive bridge between the mild beginning and end that almost \r\nseems angry, or at least as angry as these guys are capable of seeming.  I'm \r\nimagining a long winter afternoon in a very cold place where the lack of sunlight and \r\nresulting winter blues are causing the authors to become a bit cabin-fever crazed.  \r\nAll is well by the end of the song though.<p>The album closes with \"Heys\u00e1tan\", which sounds like it has some acoustic guitar in \r\nit, or maybe that's just more keyboards.  Hard to tell.  This is another one that \r\nseems to take more than half the song to develop into anything definitive, and even \r\nthen it never really takes shape.  Apparently this one is a tale about a farm kid \r\nwho's mowing and stacking piles of hay and is not enjoying the task all that much.  \r\nBut here again, everything seems to be okay in the end, and the singer contentedly \r\ntakes a break and kicks back for a rest.<p>If everything Sigur R\u00f3s does is this laid back, I have to say we could use more guys \r\nlike this in music.  This is a very refreshing departure from some of the angry rap \r\nand grunge, mindless pop and boy-band, and tired rock which dominate the business \r\nlately.  Like I said at the beginning, I don't know too much about these guys, but \r\nafter listening to this album, I can safely say I'll be buying some more of their albums \r\nin the near future.  This is a well-produced, beautifully packaged, and soothing work \r\nor art.  I can't imagine too many people buying it and feeling like they wasted their \r\nmoney.  It's fresh, original (despite the similarities to Godspeed), and quite up-\r\nbeat.  As always, timing is everything when assessing art, and the fact that it is \r\nearly spring right now, the grass is covered with fresh-smelling dew, the harsh \r\nwinter winds and snows are gone, and there are delicate little buds on my trees and \r\nroses in the yard, make this a very positive and uplifting album to be listening to at \r\nthis particular point in time.<p>I think Takk would make a very solid addition to any progressive music fan's \r\ncollection, and by definition that means it rates four stars.<p>peace</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=75153#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=75153\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=75153\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, April 16, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #75153)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8838\"><strong>Australian</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8838\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20060728_222904_wtf2.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI remember the day when I discovered this band. It was about two months ago when I \r\nwas talking to Dalezilla on the forum when he mentioned something about listening to \r\n\"Takk.\"(which means thank you) I asked who they were and what genre they were in, \r\nand after receiving the information I looked up the band and listened to some of the \r\nfree samples. The first song I listened to was \"Saeglopur\", I was immediately hooked by \r\nthis song (and still am hooked) and I rather hastily went onto eBay and bought a copy \r\nof \"Takk. \"This was the first event in a sequence of annoyances. Firstly, after ordering \r\nthe CD I went down to my local store and looked under alternative and, to my distress \r\nfound Sigur R\u00f3s. The next annoying thing was that \"Takk. \" was cheaper here than the \r\nimport. I however brought \"()\" and I wasn't all that impressed with it. <p>After being seven days overdue (14 days of waiting) I was told that the CD would be \r\ndelayed another seven to fourteen days away. So after waiting a grand total twenty \r\ndays I finally received \"Takk.\" and I was relieved. Soon after listening to the album I \r\nforgot about the annoyances and enjoyed this beautiful ambient piece of music. So the \r\ncombination of Dalezilla and Sigur R\u00f3s started an all new phase of music for me, post-\r\nrock. I have discovered among this genre one unspoken masterpiece in \"The Earth is not \r\na Cold Dead Place\" by Explosions in the Sky and another in \"F# A#\" by Godspeed You \r\nBlack Emperor. This genre has continued to amaze me and, although most of the music \r\nin Post-rock is either non-existent in Australia or is over $30, it is worth it. <p>Sigur R\u00f3s seems to be the most prominent Post-Rock band along with Godspeed You \r\nBlack Emperor and both have achieved high success, for prog bands. Sigur R\u00f3s's \"Takk.\" \r\nis by far their most successful and I was very surprised when I found where it charted, \r\n#16 UK (Gold Album), #27 US, #1 Iceland, #5 Portugal (Gold Album) #18 AUS.    It is \r\nclear from these high chart positions that Sigur R\u00f3s is a band to watch and they must \r\nhave a considerable following. I was sad when I found out that Sigur R\u00f3s did a tour of \r\nAustralia less than a month before I discovered their music, I doubt they will return for \r\nquite a while. <p>Takk. has been described by previous reviewers as being ambient and beautiful, I \r\nwhole-heartedly agree with these labels. Even from the first song there is a strong \r\natmosphere present, and for once the feeling stays throughout the WHOLE album and \r\ndoesn't drop, even for a minute. The instrument chiefly in charge of these atmospheres \r\nis the guitar, which is played with a cello bow while the guitar is on maximum reverb. I \r\nbeing a guitar player was eager to try this out so I grabbed my viola bow and tried it \r\nout, it's actually harder than it sounds as it is very awkward to play. <p>There are too many songs to go through and I really can't be bothered describing them \r\nall, but I will go through a couple. My personal favourite song is \"Saeglopur\", the opening \r\nof the song consists of twinkling bells and piano which is then joined by Jonsi's high \r\nbeautiful voice. After this intro, the storm comes in which the music gets very loud, but \r\nthis is a good type of loud, if you get my meaning. It dies down again and returns to \r\nregular ambient music. The second song on \"Takk.\"  \"Gl\u00f3s\u00f3li\", has some very admirable \r\nfeatures and the first \"section\" of it is very lush and mellow, this feeling is soon joined \r\nby a strange sound, which reminds me of Roman Soldier's studded sandals impacting on \r\ntheir extremely well make roads. There is another very loud section followed by a soft \r\nambient finish. <p>\"Milan\u00f3\" is basically focused around a piano melody which is repeated many time through \r\nthe song, \"Milan\u00f3\" is the longest song and it also has the most time changes. It changes \r\nfrom being mellow and ambient to being loud and full of retribution.  I wonder what the \r\nmeaning of the last song on this album means, \"Heys\u00e1tan.\" Perhaps it means hello Satan \r\nor something. This brings me to another point the fact that all the vocals are either \r\nsung in Icelandic or made up makes no bad impression on the music. I'd actually go as \r\nfar as saying that I couldn't imagine \"Takk.\" with lyrics in any other language. The fact \r\nthat Sigur R\u00f3s is Icelandic sort of makes their music more interesting and they would \r\nprobably be inclined to incorporate traditional Icelandic elements into their music. Fusion \r\nbetween different types of music usually creates some type of interesting hybrid style \r\nof music. <p>I personally love Post-rock and \"Takk.\" is one of the leading albums in the genre. Sigur \r\nR\u00f3s's style of Post-rock is different to that of say. Godspeed You Black Emperor but \r\nboth contain the same new in old energy. All Post-rock bands use the old and new to \r\ncreate music and this is what makes the genre is great. I'd say that every one should \r\nhave a sample of Post-rock, just to try it out and I'd say that \"Takk.\" would be quite high \r\non the list, but the last thing I have to say is that not all Post-rock is the same.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88100#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88100\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=88100\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, August 24, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #88100)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI really believe that \"Takk\" is one of the best albums in the Post-Rock genre. I have rarely listened to \r\nmusic that pulls at my emotions like this. This is so uplifting and beautiful, it's difficult to put into words, but i'll try. Eight out of the \r\neleven songs I would give 5 out of 5. Nice packaging as well from the boys of Iceland, although no real information is given other then the titles of the songs.<p>\r\nWe get started with the title track and it's so uplifting. It builds and builds then \r\njust stops. \"Glosoli\" begins with a bass line, as we hear gentle singing over top.The bass really \r\nstrengthens until mayhem occurs. Overwhelming !  \"Hoppipolla\" is a transcendant song due in \r\npart to the strings and the acute vocals. \"Mea Blotnasir\" builds to a bass / drum / vocal melody. Piano joins in as well. Nice. \"Se Lest\" is another favourite. Piano eventually comes in before vocals and a fuller sound at 1 1/2 minutes.This sounds amazing. It settles right down to piano only around 5 minutes in. Horns a minute later. The first 5 minutes of this song are beyond words, i'm not as impressed with the last part of the track though.<p> \"Saglopur\" sounds absolutely incredible when the fuller sound arrives before 2 minutes.  \"Milano\" may be my favourite, and the most \r\nuplifting. Yeah, i know, i'm sounding like a broken record. Lots of atmosphere early. It's building 4 minutes in then settles after 4 1/2 minutes before kicking back in around 7 minutes. \"Gong\" has some violin in it and it's quite mellow until a fuller sound arrives before a minute. Drums come and eventually vocals. Great sound !  \"Andvan\" is a beautiful but sad tune. Waves of sound end it.  \"Suo Hljott\" is mellow as well once it gets going. Strings in this one too. It builds beautifuly. This is heavenly.  \"Heysatan\" is mellow with piano. Vocals before 1 1/2 minutes. <p>\r\nUplifting ! Building ! Emotional !\r\nBeautiful ! These are the words that to me describe \"Takk\". Truly a Post-Rock masterpiece in every \r\nsense of the word !  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=91117#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=91117\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=91117\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, September 23, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #91117)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1246\"><strong>Neu!mann</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1246\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1246/Foot-Foot_P.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAnybody wanting a beginner's guide to the music of Sigur R\u00f3s will likely find this 2005 album \r\nthe perfect introduction to their unique and haunting sound. It plays like a reaffirmation of \r\nthe band's career to date, combining the subtle strengths of \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun\" (my own \r\ninitiation into the Sigur R\u00f3s soundworld) with the deeper melancholy of their \r\nanonymous \"( )\" album, one moment as delicate as an early morning spider's web, and \r\nminutes later loud enough to trigger an avalanche.<p>Put another way: this is music resting comfortably astride that fine line dividing chamber \r\norchestra intimacy and over-amped electronic mayhem. A typical Sigur R\u00f3s song gradually \r\nmoves from nursery rhyme stillness to noisy, cathartic apotheosis, with falsetto Icelandic \r\nvoices raised in eerie sing-song harmony mantras under a sheer wall of symphonic strings \r\nand droning, fuzzed-out guitars. Even with the expected language/cultural barrier there's \r\nenough naked emotion here to bring tears of epiphany to your eyes.<p>And an atypical Sigur R\u00f3s song can be just about anything. Bend an ear toward the \r\ntrack \"Gong\", a Number One hit single in my own private pop-radio charts.<p>In short, it's a work of rare maturity, from the understated simplicity of the cover art to the \r\nautumnal beauty of the music itself. Is it Prog Rock? Maybe not in any traditional sense, \r\nbut when did truly progressive music ever stick to tradition?<p>The way I add it up, 50% neo-classical austerity plus 50% Post-Rock power equals a 100% \r\nsuperlative musical experience, very much deserving a privileged spot in the library of any \r\nforward thinking Prog Rock aficionado.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=92943#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=92943\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=92943\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 1, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #92943)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1123\"><strong>TRoTZ</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn Takk Sigur R\u00f3s deffinitely found the way of making good albuns again, revitalazing their \r\nsound. The band did not quit intelligentely of their celestial expressionist trademark sound, \r\nbut moving it into other direction. The album transmitts more an idea of an \"nostalgic \r\njoyfullness\" rather than the funereal feeling of their previous releases. In part, that's the \r\nreason for the big commercial success worldwide - they had a terrific formula, they just had \r\nto put it in a way people would accept it easily.<p>The album as great tracks, since the crescendo sonic power of \"Glosoli\" till the intrigant \r\nmajestic beauty of \"Sorglega\", perhaps the best, the album is full of great \r\nmoments. \"Saeglopur\" is one of those moments, another moment of deep celestial beauty \r\ntaken into the cosmic radiance. Other highlights, using the same formula, \r\ninclude \"Hoppipolla\" and the longest \"Milano\". Piano lines are all over the album and are \r\nquite inspired. So as the back sounds which help the album to reach its profoundness.<p>A great album. The band seems to be, further and further, more confident and solid on \r\nwhat they're doing, as they reach more maturity.

Even more if you think of the influences the band had\r\nin their earlier years; I'm talking about the great Radiohead\u00b4s and their Icelandic\r\nfellow citizen Bj\u00f6rk. definitely not happy music (although Bj\u00f6rk might not be that\r\nsad and depressive either), and the mellow, gloomy yet beautiful previous albums. So,\r\nwhere is Sigur R\u00f3s going then? Well, it seems like they have said (is this word\r\ncorrectly used in this word-less music.?) everything they had to say with one style\r\nso, in a true progressive act, they changed it, but don't be alarmed old Sigur R\u00f3s\r\nfans, the change is not abrupt, but gentle and subtle, the band might have said good\r\nbye to their blue moody feeling, but a certain melancholy is still present.<p>The whole album seems also to be very connected from song to song, which makes this\r\n(almost) a big piece of music that definitely has to be heard entirely in order to be\r\nfully enjoyed. <p>Although all songs seem to be quite similar at first, it's not really the case;\r\nrepeatedly listening will show the individuality of each piece that go from the\r\natmospheric \"Gls\u00f3li\", to the incredibly beautiful \"Hopp\u00edpolla\", my personal favorite,\r\nto the epics \"S\u00e9 Lest\" and \"Milano\". The end result is warm, intimist and very\r\npersonal yet powerful. At first one might wonder what it is that is sounding at\r\ncertain moments; is that the guitar? Is that the voice? Is that a keyboard? But after\r\na while one stops to wonder about this and just let's the \"sound\" take one away until\r\nit reaches a beautiful calmness with a good chance of falling gently asleep to it.<p>Definitely not for everybody and for any mood, Metal fans stay away (unless you are\r\nopen minded), but for those of you that can appreciate the softer, more gentle side\r\nof music. well, what are you waiting for?<p>\r\nPS: A piece of advise, do not listen while doing some sort of physical activity, no\r\nmatter how beautiful it can be sitting down, it can get quite irritating while doing\r\nsome sport! I know it from personal experience! \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=116424#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=116424\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=116424\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, March 26, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #116424)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10113\"><strong>obiter</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10113\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20071004_223152_DJB_MCKEE_Hawk_.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nthis album was my introduction to Sigur Ros, so my review is tainted with the heightened and exaggerated emotional responses\r\nwhich always accompany first encounters. i don't come with expectations and comparisons ready from previous albums. it's just\r\na first blush response.<p>well i suppose i should start with the obvious for the completely uninitiated. this is mostly instrumental: often singing is\r\nused it is more of a voice instrument rather than a bloke giving it up at centre stage singing \"with my hands open, my eyes\r\nopen, i just keep hopin' your heart opens\". i don't know why i thought of that.

This is very quiet music with a hint of \r\npeace tainted by dark overtones. <p>Takk was not my preferred CD to obtain from the band but it was the cheapest and most accessible at the \r\ntime of searching in the CD stores so I tried it out as I had heard so much about this enigmatic band. <p>I cannot say I was completely overwhelmed by their style but it makes a nice change after a day of \r\nthrashing Devin Townsend or Rush. <p>I can only recommend this CD if you want a very tranquil CD sound that calms the nerves and helps you \r\nto unwind. I have no idea what the CD is about but there is an ambience that is unmistakeable and pure \r\nSigur Ros. <p>Try it and see.

The music is generally slow building and repetitive, focusing on creating an emotional melancholic atmosphere with layers of sounds and effects. The deep melancholy is further enchanced by the distinct sounding high pitched vocals by <B>J\u00f3nsi Birgission</B>. He has an emotional delivery, which in a beautiful way conveys the darker and more melancholic moments in a person\u00b4s life without sounding like a bleak depression. Because there is light here too, it\u00b4s just featured in small doses and presented in a subtle manner.<p>While the tracks aren\u00b4t overtly complex, the many layers of sounds and effects and the frequent use of unconventional time signatures, make <em>\"Takk...\"</em> a relatively challenging listen. It\u00b4s not inaccessible music and if you want to listen to it as dreamy background music that\u00b4s an option too, but opting to give it a deeper and more thourough listen is incredibly rewarding as the album is loaded with sonic details designed to tickle the emotional centers of your brain. <em>\"Takk...\"</em> features a warm, dynamic, and organic sound production, which is a perfect fit for the material, and it\u00b4s overall a very well sounding release. A 4 star (80%) rating is deserved.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220758#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220758\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=220758\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, June 12, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #220758)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=22970\"><strong>Conor Fynes</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=22970\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/22970/30451_10150198165215024_781110023_13173148_4731438_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/1stars.gif\" alt=\"1 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> 'Takk...' - Sigur Ros (2.5/10) </strong><p>Well, wasn't this something... I had heard alot of things about Sigur Ros; apparently they were \r\none of the leading post-rock bands of all time, and posessed an immensely beautiful sound. \r\nI am a fair fan of the genre (at times being quite enamoured with the musical stylings of God \r\nIs An Astronaut and Explosions In The Sky) and alot of what I had heard in the genre had been \r\nindeed; quite beautiful in it's orchestration and composition.<p>What joy it was for me -keeping those high hopes in mind- to come across this little \r\ngem, 'Takk.'<p>I'm blown away... in all the worst ways possible.<p>Five or so minutes into listening, I became incredibly confused as to why the band's music \r\nwas so highly rated on this site. What graced my ears was a very confused, noisy, sonic \r\nmess, with the occasional agreeable texture popping out of the audio.<p>With 'Hoppipolla,' I even got a tiny bit hopeful. There was actually a decent piano riff there, \r\nalthough certainly nothing special.<p>After getting half-way through the album, I was convinced that it wasn't necessarily the \r\ninstrumentation that bothered me so much (although the noisy mixing would have gotten to \r\nme eventually) as much as the gruesome vocals.<p>Jonsi's vocals are possibly the worst I've ever heard in all of progressive music, no lie. And to \r\nall of the obvious lovers of this band, I am quite musically open minded. But listening to what \r\ncan only be likened to a child having inhaled an overdose of some gaseous substance.<p>Another thing that irritated me (although this has more to do with the band's style more so \r\nthan the album in specific) were the nonsensical, Hopelandic vocals. I can understand it's \r\nsomething creative and 'different' (which is what Prog is all about) but having Jonsi chirp out \r\ngibberish certainly didn't deter me from thinking I was listening to an infant howl.<p>The best way I can describe 'Takk...' is if Alvin and the Chipmunks recorded an album and Devin Townsend decided to produce it; it would come out sounding something like this.<p>I can understand that this isn't for everyone, and I would suggest anyone not initiated into the \r\nband should at least give them a try, because apparently I'm a minority in hating them. They \r\nare CERTAINLY not for me though. One of the most dissapointing musical journies I've ever \r\ntaken.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=223652#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=223652\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=223652\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 28, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #223652)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAnother very good Post Rock/Math Rock album from Iceland's own.

Album highlights: the delicate, \"S\u00e9 Lest\" (8:40) (8/10); the unusually heavy, \"Saegl\u00f3pur\" (7:39) (8/10); the beautifully orchestrated and mostly ambient, \"Svo Hlj\u00f3tt\" (7:25) (9/10); the dirge-like, \"Heys\u00e1tan\" (4:10) (8/10), and; one of my favorite Sigur R\u00f3s songs, \"Milan\u00f3\" (10:27) (10/10). </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=406581#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=406581\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=406581\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, February 23, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #406581)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17216\"><strong>Sinusoid</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSigur Ros were quite interesting to listen to when I first heard (); quiet, melancholic until the\r\ndynamics changed a bit in the second half.  My second try with the group is just as interesting as I\r\nwent along with TAKK... more so than () on the first spin, but TAKK... still takes a few sit-down\r\nlistens before one ''gets it''.  Post-rock is probably the most finnicky genre I've run across\r\nsimply because you really have to have the right mindset when you listen and failure to do so will\r\nmake the album rub you the wrong way.<p>There are eleven tracks in total, but I almost feel that there should be just seven.  For example,\r\nTrack 4 sounds like an extension of ''Hoppipolla''.  The middle three tracks I feel are the\r\nstrongest, particular the climb/descend feel of ''Milano''; it can be an absolutely riveting\r\nexperience being swept away by the dynamic changes.  ''Se lest'' has a far more playful feel\r\ncomplete with a brass band tooting along.  The keyboards are pretty rich in spots, the guitars are\r\nbeautifully subdued and the drumming (the band's strong point) rarely fails to impress.  There also\r\nseems to be a whole album feel as opposed to track-by-track structure with somewhat of a bookending\r\nfeel (first and last tracks sound quite similar).<p>Tracks like ''Gong'' have almost an indie feel to them with the standard rock pattern with slight\r\nover-production, but that particular one segues into a more beautiful ''Andvari''.  There is this\r\ninner beauty to TAKK... that stands out as one of the better albums of the post-rock genre that I've\r\nheard, and the strange inter-connected-ness and Jonsi's near angelic vocals only add to the appeal.\r\n If you have any interest in post-rock, sit back and let the music flow.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=527974#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=527974\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=527974\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, September 20, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #527974)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWith another gorgeous and delicate album along the lines of ( ), Sigur Ros' Takk may offer \r\nnothing in the way of surprises but the distinctive Sigur Ros style of post-rock hasn't become \r\ntiresome yet.

TAKK? (means 'thanks' in Icelandic and other Scandinavian \r\nlanguages) continued the success following \"(  )\" and hit the number one spot on Iceland's album charts and was another \r\ninternational success story as well. As with previous albums the lyrics appear in the invented language Hopelandic a great deal but \r\nTAKK? has many tracks in Icelandic as well, however they come across as angelic gibberish all the same sounding like a more \r\nclassically infused version of the Cocteau Twins at times.<p>While stylistically TAKK? doesn't deviate significantly from the established overall sound that   \r\nSIGUR R\u00d3S had latched onto on \"\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun\" and carried on with \"(  ),\" the music has actually become significantly more complex \r\nwith more extensive uses of time signature changes and complex polyrhythms. And also while previous albums were limited to the \r\nfour main musicians with four guest musicians appearing on \"(  ),\" the band clearly had a larger budget to play with on TAKK? which \r\nfinds an astonishing sixteen guests providing cellos, violins, violas, trumpets, trombones and additional vocals (even a choir) and \r\npercussion. The results of which allow a substantially more lush and full effect sound that allows the many musicians to sound like a \r\ncomplex symphony rather than a more mortal post-rock band from Reykjav\u00edk. <p>TAKK? is yet another tranquil journey into an ethereal sonic journey that incorporates lush ambient passages, placid childlike vocals \r\nportraying a possible worldview of innocence and peacefulness along with a sophisticated string and brass section that master the \r\nart of note slides and subtle leapfrogging effects. While the music slinks by on simmer for the majority of the album's hour plus run, \r\nthere are outbursts of climactic rock crescendos that unleash the normally tamped down electric guitars however they don't last \r\nlong so do not expect the emphasis on TAKK? to be in the rock department. In fact this is much more of an art pop creation that \r\njust happens to have rock elements casually strewn about.<p>In all regards, TAKK? perfectly evolves the band to the next level without sacrificing any of the elements that cast them in a global \r\ngaze of admiration however to their credit they took the sound and expanded it in the most logical manner?  that being an \r\nexpansion of the musicians to broaden the sound, a more sophisticated approach in constructing the compositions and utilizing \r\neven more catchy pop sensibilities on tinkly piano melodies and polyrhythms. To the untrained ear TAKK? may sound simply like \r\nmore of the same but for those who have engaged in even a casual classical music appreciation course will be able to pinpoint the \r\ndifferences. TAKK? may not win over any converts who don't have the ear for this most bizarre of sounds but it is certainly a worthy \r\nfollow-up to a string of exciting albums.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1783986#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1783986\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1783986\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 18, 2017</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1783986)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=27874\"><strong>TCat</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=27874\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/27874/4150874369_330_1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n'Takk'', the fourth album by Sigur Ros is the 3rd album in their amazing run of 5 star albums.  This time, most of the albums \r\nlyrics are in Icelandic, except for 3 tracks which are entirely in Hopelandic; 'Andvan', 'Gong' and 'Milano'.  The songs on the \r\nalbum have some very tricky meters which can change several times within a single track.  <p>The album starts with 'Takk'' (Thanks') which acts as a drone-like introduction to the album, setting the mood for the band's \r\nsignature sound.  'Glosoli' (Glowing Sun) was the first single released as a download only release on iTunes.  The video for this \r\nsong is one of the band's most memorable, the migration of children to a cliffs edge where they jump off and swim through \r\nthe air, taking inspiration from the JD Salinger classic 'Catcher in the Rye'.  The music has levels of synths and light percussion \r\nwith the signature vocals.  The music grows increasingly intense until it get to the end where it creates a thick wall of sound of \r\nguitars, keys and percussion which suddenly drops off leaving soft synths and chimes.  <p>'Hoppipolia' (Hopping Into Puddles) was the 2nd single from the album and was nicknamed 'The Money Song' because the \r\nband considered it a commercially successful song.  It is quite a bit more standard sounding, but has the lush sounds with a \r\nheavily orchestrated sound with strings and brass.  The melody and the instruments utilizing lovely melodies making the \r\nsound quite victorious sounding and dynamic.  'Meo Bloonasir' With a Nosebleed) acts as a coda of sorts to 'Hoppipolia' and \r\ncontinues with a variation to the melody from that track, with more standard instruments instead of the orchestra.  <p>'Se Lest' (I See a Train) begins with tonal percussion and Jon's falsetto swirling around wordlessly with layered vocals below \r\nthat.  Strings come in developing the sound somewhat and then growing softer again as more vocals continue and soon the \r\nstrings swell again.  This is one of those tracks where his vocals sound more like an instrument then a voice, very beautiful \r\nand angelic.  Towards the middle, things quiet down to nothing but chimes and vibes, sounding very childlike and innocent, \r\nand Jon's voice eventually comes back in softly with the same high falsetto.  The brass starts to come in now and starts to \r\nswell as the other sounds fade off.  There is a slightly carnival type feel as the music slips into a valse tempo, then fades back \r\nto the minimal sounds again.  <p>'Saeglopur' (Lost at Sea) is another single from the album and is, again, another recognizable track.  This is one of my \r\nfavorites from the band, and is also accompanied by another excellent video depicting a young child drowning and being \r\nrescued, but very artfully done.  This track has been used for several movies and TV shows like 'Life of Pi' and 'Aquaman'.  \r\nThe music is very soft and relaxing at first, but halfway through becomes more frantic and intense, the melody becoming \r\nmore front and center making it easy to recognize.  After the long climax, the music softens to a droning guitars and piano \r\nwith the angelic vocals continuing.  The layers ebb and flow in intensity until the end.  <p>'Milano' (named after the Italian city Milan) is the longest track at over 10 minutes.  It was written together with the band and \r\nthe string quartet 'Amina'.  It is based around a lovely music box style melody that repeats itself as the music develops \r\naround it.  The strings become slowly louder as they create a lush layer of sound under the keys and bass.  A moderate tempo \r\nbecomes more apparent as the song continues with Jon's signature vocals bringing in an increase in volume and intensity.  \r\nThis softens again at about the midway point bringing back the main music box theme.  The track develops around this \r\nmelody as other instruments and layers join in and it suddenly reaches another apex after 7 minutes.  It quiets down and \r\nslowly fades.<p>'Gong' fades in with a guitar arpeggio and it quickly becomes more upbeat and less minimal, but still peaceful yet more like a \r\nstandard song.  The lyrical quality of the vocals drives this song more than the preceding tracks, as they are less of an \r\ninstrument on the track and thus standout more as on traditionally constructed songs and building towards the heavier \r\nmiddle then settling down to chiming guitars and strings.  'Andvari' (Zephyr) is another tricky song with changing meters and \r\na pattern of time signature changes that is heard in the 27 bar melody.  The accents on different beats translates into a \r\ncomplex pattern while playing against 18 bar phrases in a background of 3/8 time.  Quite complicated, yet very progressive.  \r\nThat strange pattern still produces a beautiful and quiet track that stays lush and pensive throughout.<p>'Svo Hijott' (So Quietly) begins with softly ringing synths that bring in a theme with a soft electric piano and vocals.  Once \r\nagain, Jon's voice  becomes a beautiful instrument alternating between falsetto and stronger vocals.  The music swells, \r\nbringing in strings and a strange haziness.  The unique e-bow sound comes in more apparent on this track as it intensifies and \r\nit all turns into another thick wall of sound, and then backs off a bit leaving a steadier rhythm before building \r\nagain.  'Heysatan' (Haystack) is the last track and, except for the intro track, the shortest track at just over 4 minutes.  It stars \r\nwith a slow chord progression done by the guitar and a sustained synth underneath it.  After a minute, pensive vocals come in \r\nas this one remains quite minimal as an epilogue to the album.  Yet it is still lovely.<p>I continue to love Sigur Ros unique sound and beauty.  Even when the sound is the thickest, it is still beautiful.  This album is \r\nmore pensive and seems to have a theme of childhood and innocence and the effect that bad experiences can have on \r\ninnocence.  While the previous two albums had more dissonance and heavier sections at times, this one stays on the softer \r\nside, yet it still can conjure up some unsettling sections.  Where '()', the untitled 3rd album from the band seemed to be based \r\nupon each song building upon the last to create a heavy climactic ending to the overall album, this one has apexes at different \r\ntimes, yet still stays more pensive than the untitled album and 'Agaetis Byrjun' before that.  The latter album experiments \r\nmore with dynamics, where this one takes its time to develop, but does so in shorter bursts and less often.  All 3 albums are \r\nmasterpieces, however, and I consider them all easily worth 5 stars for their ingenuity and unique, yet lovely sound.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2219665#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2219665\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2219665\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 9, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=8890#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2219665)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nListen to Sigur Ros is a bit ' like looking at a photograph of a little ' blurry, which you do not\r\nhave a complete perception.
