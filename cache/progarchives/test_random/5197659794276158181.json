This is the second, and to me, the best Fusion era Bruford album. The four musicians combine their talents to make some amazing music. Berlin takes the bass to a new level. Holdsworth's guitar soars and trades off with Stewart's keyboards to twist some gnarly melodic solos. Bruford's kit snaps with pure energy and finesse. There is a lot of humor, also, in the interplay. I'd love to see these guys re-group for one disc, ala, Soft Works. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27897#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27897\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=27897\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, February 13, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #27897)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis record only contains hyper-talented musicians: Bill Bruford's drums are extremely solid and restless! Dave Stewart arrives with his miscellaneous melodies, catchy solos and floating patterns in a fusion album! Allan Holdsworth is absolutely amazing with his impossible guitars. We feel Jeff Berlin, one of the best bass players in the jazz history (my favorite one), plays in a retentive way, probably in order to not steal the show: nevertheless, he plays at 100% of his capacity on couples of passages. There are some outstanding percussions, especially xylophone. Everything is deeply loaded, extremely structured and very complex. Dave Stewart has many floating streams of rather urban keyboards: this gives color to the ensemble. If you like the fusion band Uzeb, then you'll like this record! I must finally mention a last artist, among my most favorite ones, who contributed to the realization of this album: EDDIE JOBSON: we feel his strong influence on the \"Sahara of snow\" tracks!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27900#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27900\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=27900\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, April 8, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #27900)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis album is very special for me personally. First, this was my first album that I \r\npurchased from BILL BRUFORD solo work. Second, this was my first time I knew ALLAN \r\nHOLDSWORTH the great guitarist and JEFF BERLIN the powerful bassist. My first \r\nimpression of listening to this album the first time (end of 79, I think), I was kind of \r\nlistening to the drumming style of YES \"Fragile\" but with totally different kind of music, a \r\nblend of jazz and rock, I would say. I think \"jazz\" is probably what BILL wants as his \r\nmusic aspiration as I understand from the story of YES that one of the reasons he \r\njoined YES was that he thought that YES would play jazz.<p>This kind of  BRUFORD music has then inspired (I think) FINNEUS GAUGE (Echolyn's \r\ntransition band) through their only two albums \"More Once More\" and \"One Inch of the \r\nFall\".<p>\"Hell's Bells\" is an uplifting track that opens the album. Its melody is dominated by DAVE \r\nSTEWART's keyboard. It's a nice track. Unfortunately it ends up with a \"fade out\" style \r\nthat I don't favor very much. The title track \"One of a Kind Part One - Part Two\" is a \r\nvery energetic track with heavy and unique drumming of Bruford. I think these two \r\ntracks should be positioned as opening tracks. Wonderful composition.<p>\"Travels With Myself - And Someone Else\" is a very nice slow track with great keyboard \r\nand guitar sounds. DAVE STEWART's style is similar (or in the vein of) WEATHER \r\nREPORT keyboard play. JEFF BERLIN's bass is also nice here.<p>If I have to choose one best track of this album or any other BRUFORD's solo, I \r\ndefinitely would vote for FAINTING IN COILS (the fifth track of this album). Oh boy .. \r\nthis is really a beautifully crafted composition!!! Brilliant. It opened with soft keyboard \r\nsound followed by short and \"funny\" narration by SAM ALDER, ALICE ANTHEA, \r\nNORMAN TAYLOR and THE MOCK TURTLE BILL BRUFORD.  Even the dialogue at the \r\nnarration is really the key to set the overall tone of the track. The solo keyboard sound \r\nand guitar fills  are backed by dazzling bass playing and drumming to accentuate the \r\nmelody. At the intro, after the narrator said \"Fainting in Coils\" the music that follows is \r\na kind of the four instruments do not blend in harmony but it still produce wonderful \r\nsound. I like it! Every musical segment of this track creates an orgasmic and memorable \r\nmelody, especially the tagline melody which is played repeatedly. If you never heard \r\nBRUFORD, I would suggest you to play this track first. It's amazing!!!<p>\"Five G\" is a  typical jazz rock fusion music with dynamic bass at intro part.  Well, I don't \r\nwant to review all tracks but overall all tracks have the same musical quality. \"Forever \r\nUntil Sundary\", \"The Sahara of Snow, Pt. 1 and 2\" are all great tracks. One interesting \r\nobservation about this album is on musicianship. All musicians contribute in their right \r\nbalance to create wonderful blend of instrumentations in the composition. No single \r\ninstrument or group of instruments played dominantly. Even, sometime bass is used as \r\nmelody, for example in \"The Abingdon Chasp\". On ALLAN HOLDSWORTH, this was my \r\nfirst time knowing his kind of gutar playing style. It's unique and it has inspired other \r\nguitarists as well. <p>Overall, I recommend you to purchase this album, especially if you like RETURN TO \r\nFOREVER, WEATHER REPORT, BRAND X, JACO PASTORIUS. They are not alike, \r\ncomposition-wise, but it might be categorized under the same umbrella. It's your call. \r\nBut I am pretty damn sure that I'm not na\u00efve to give this album FIVE STAR (songwriting, \r\nmusicianship, sonic production of CD, and overall performance). You must try FAINTING \r\nIN COILS! It will blow your mind, definitely! - Gatot Widayanto, Indonesia.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27895#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=27895\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=27895\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, July 7, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #27895)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=6909\"><strong>belz</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=6909\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/belz/1DA6C_sloche_mini.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n3.4/5.0<p>\r\nI don't understand why so many people believe this is a masterpiece.

However, maybe it's just me, but the 80's sound and keyboards just don't really \r\ntouch me...

If you like neoprog or \r\nmusic from the 80's, you might like this, as it is \"modern\" in that way.

This is very technical Jazz-Rock, with Bill Bruford on drums, Allan Holdsworth on guitar, Jeff Berlin on bass and Dave Stewart on keyboards. All extremely talented musicians. The music is great! Very moody and very complex with very beautiful melodies. The album sounds more like a regular group effort than a solo album. And that's what I like about it. It's more natural than other solo album I've heard when the \"main\" musician is showing off like a madman! This is not the case here. Brufords drumming is gently laid in the same line as the other instruments.  <p>I would highly recommend this one to all people who like Jazz-Rock/Fusion. This one's a must! 4.5/5 <p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81816#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81816\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=81816\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, June 23, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #81816)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1117\"><strong>Cygnus X-2</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1117\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20061019_175801_Assassing1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBill Bruford's second solo outing, called One of a Kind, features the same core\r\nlineup from Feels Good to Me, only this time the grating vocals of Anne Peacock are\r\ngone because this album is entirely instrumental (except for one section of one\r\nsong). Being that it is instrumental, you can expect each musician to give their\r\nabsolute all on this album, and the overall musicianship is nothing short of amazing.\r\nThe highly complex and intricate rhythms and sequences are performed with ease,\r\nstyle, and cohesiveness in a way I've never heard any other jazz rock band perform.\r\nOne of a Kind stands out from the rest of the pack of fusion albums I have because I\r\nfind it to be the most captivating and overall rewarding album in this style. My\r\nabsolute favorite fusion album? Yes. Why? Read below.<p>It begins with the churning and modulated synthesizers of Hell's Bells, which has one\r\nof the zaniest time signatures you'll ever see. Dave Stewart really pulls out all the\r\nstops on this song, especially during the section where Bruford enters. Holdsworth\r\nenters the song with a bang, too, with some great guitar work especially when he\r\nbegins to solo in his classic swirling style. One of a Kind is a two part piece that\r\nbegins with some zany vibes and some droning synthesizer notes underneath some more\r\nsuperb ascending and descending riffing from Holdsworth. The second part begins with\r\nsome great drumming from Bruford and some well timed bass fills from Berlin, who\r\nreally is one of the best jazz bassists I've ever heard. Travels With Myself -- And\r\nSomeone Else begins with some nice synthesizers from Dave Stewart as well as some\r\nintuitive bass fills from Berlin, who really breaks away from the pack on this piece.\r\nFainting in Coils has a brief narration on top of some forboding music. The track has\r\na nice sense of evolution and really goes through some interesting sections. Dave\r\nStewart and Holdsworth exchange solos and really get into a nice duel while Bruford\r\nand Berlin set the groove for the track.<p>Five G begins with a stellar phased bass riff from Berlin that soon becomes a groovy\r\nfrantically based theme. Holdsworth really shines on this track giving a guitar solo\r\nequally as frantic as the pace of the song. Bruford also is a great on this song with\r\nmany well timed and great sounding fills. The Abingdon Chasp is probably my favorite\r\nsong on the album along with Hell's Bells. This Holdsworth written tune is just\r\nutterly perfect, from the harmonized guitar chords and the superb progression of the\r\nmusicians, to the great bass/drum interplay between Bruford and Berlin, to the\r\noverall stellar riff and atmosphere of the song, it's all there. Forever Until\r\nSundary is a more atmospheric and ethereal piece, with a lot of floating keyboards\r\nand a nice keyboard theme as well as some intuitive drumming from Bruford, who can\r\nmake even the most simple of drumbeats into something amazing. The song quickly picks\r\nup in pace and becomes a great guitar driven piece with some great bass work from\r\nBerlin underneath the floating and smooth leads from Holdsworth. The Sahara of Snow\r\nends the album is a two part extravaganza. The first of which begins slowly, with a\r\ndissonant and eerie organ that changes pace quickly by the stroke of Bruford's sticks\r\nas he gives another great drum fill. The piece builds up nicely and never gets too\r\nout of hand even during the most trick of situations and never gets boring or\r\ncontrived, just all out playing for around 9 minutes (that's if you add the two parts\r\ntogether).<p>In the end, while Feels Good to Me was a good album that had some flaws vocally, One\r\nof a Kind is a truly one of a kind album with some incredibly talented musicians\r\nplaying some great complex and challenging music. There are really no weak tracks on\r\nthis album and I can't really fault it with anything remotely bad. It's a perfect\r\nrecord, and I am proud to call it my favorite fusion record. Recommended to all\r\nfusion fans as well as those who like the power and prowess of Bill Bruford. 5/5.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=85074#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=85074\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=85074\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, July 29, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #85074)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11104\"><strong>1800iareyay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nUpon the the first abdication of the Crimson King, Bill Bruford found himself out of a job and \r\nunwilling to return to Yes (probably a wise decision considering how close that band was to \r\nhitting the skids). So, he did the only conceivable thing, he formed a jazz fusion group. \r\nBruford's fame allowed him access to some of the greatest jazz musicians the world has \r\never seen. He recruited Jeff Berlin on bass, Dave Stewart on keys, and the incredible Allan \r\nHoldsworth on guitar. Together they forged a fusion classic on par with the Mahavishnu \r\nOrchestra's finest work.<p>Every song on this album brims with energy, and it's refreshing to see a solo artist who \r\ndoesn't comand the attention. Bruford is a musician first (after, he quit Yes to experiment \r\nin KC), and he understands the value of a cohesive unit. Dave Stewart gets as much \r\nspotlight as Bill or Allan. In the end, the willingness, even eagerness, to share the spotlight \r\nmakes this album great. Songs like \"Hells Bells\" and \"Sahara of Snow\" are Bruford staples. \r\nThe crowning achievement of this disc is Fainting in Coils. I gotta hand it to Gatot whose \r\nreview inspired me to get this album. His favorite track is FiC, and after many listens, I \r\nhave to agree with him.<p>This album has nearly no flaws, and any flaws that exist are drowned out by excellence. \r\nThis album is a standard of fusion and is every bit as important and good as MO's Birds of \r\nFire or The Inner Mounting Flame </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=102647#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=102647\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=102647\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, December 11, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #102647)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=6905\"><strong>Chicapah</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=6905\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070711_112949_Levitati&#111;n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI can't tell you how relieved I am to know that there are others out there in Progville \r\nwho enjoy this album as much as I do.  When it came out in 1979 most of my friends \r\n(early Yes fans included) dismissed it without even giving it a listen even though I \r\nassured them that it never got \"noisy.\" But then they didn't appreciate jazz rock-fusion \r\nlike I did, either.  Oh, well.  Their loss.  Back to the album.  It's the only offering we got \r\nfrom this particular lineup of incredible musicians so it is definitely \"One of a Kind.\"  <p>The first cut, \"Hell's Bells\" (no, not the AC/DC romp) gives the listeners a fine sample of \r\nwhat is in store for us for the next 45 minutes.  The lively song is very up front and \r\nimmediate sounding and takes us through many changes, thereby avoiding becoming \r\ntiresome or formulaic.  \"One of a Kind,\" more than any other tune, reveals their \r\nrespectable Return to Forever influence without ever crossing the line into copying \r\nthem.  There is even a xylophone playing along to add some flavor.  \"Pt. 2\" features Bill \r\nBruford's crisp and individualistic angularity on the drums.  \"Travels with Myself and \r\nSomeone Else\" starts out beautifully with Dave Stewart on piano and some steel guitar \r\nfrom Allan Holdsworth.  (Yes, steel guitar on a jazz album!).  It's also the first time Jeff \r\nBerlin gets to step out front and display his mastery of the fretless bass.  The guy is a \r\nmonster.  \"Fainting in Coils\" is probably the most complex of all the songs with its odd, \r\nconstantly changing time signatures and exhilarating accents.  It travels down some \r\nintriguing roads, including one that uses finger snaps for percussion.  \"Five G\" is my \r\nfavorite because the whole group bristles right along, driving way over the posted \r\nspeed limit.  Berlin and Bruford lay down a hyper funky feel that's tighter than a rusted \r\nlug nut while Allan shows off his amazing guitar stylizations.  Holdsworth's \"The \r\nAbington Chasp\" is next and it features some great harmony guitar lines and allows \r\nBruford to shine discretely towards the end.  \"Forever Until Sunday\" is a slow, delicate \r\npiece that features a soulful violin.  It's an unaccredited performance so I don't know if \r\nit's a real violin or an excellent keyboard imitation but it lends a gorgeous tone to the \r\nsong.  Like other tunes on this album, it doesn't stay still for long and soon turns up the \r\ntempo and introduces a rocking guitar riff before settling down once more.  \"The \r\nSahara of Snow\" has a mysterious, atmospheric beginning that quickly morphs into a \r\nbusy, industrious urban spirit that once again utilizes the xylophone sound.  \"Pt. 2\" \r\nchanges to more of a rock walking march and takes us to the final note.<p>It's worth mentioning that Bill Bruford wrote or co-wrote eight of the ten songs, \r\nshowing that he is much more than an exceptional stick man.  If you like progressive \r\ninstrumental music that doesn't get itself bogged down in over-long virtuoso posturing \r\nthen this is for you.  I can promise you this.  It's never boring or predictable and the \r\nmusicianship is phenomenal from beginning to end.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=112506#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=112506\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=112506\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, February 17, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #112506)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12334\"><strong>b_olariu</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12334\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12334/4927969.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOne of a kind indeed, album and musician<p>Featuring some top notch musicians, this album is more listenable than previous one, with \r\nmore funky, catchy tunes.

While a real fan \r\nof JR/F, I must say that by the late 70's, the genre's cold aloofness, precise (way too much) and prissily playing, ultra-technical but \r\nsoulless \"songwriting\" never enthused me. Just to make it clear, while I still find Ponty's classic 70's albums or Brand X's early albums \r\nrather enjoyable and still get the occasional nowadays, but Weather Report's post 77 albums or <p>Anyway, with Bruford's all-star line-up of Holdsworth, Stuart and Berlin, this sounded like the winning combination to make a killer of \r\na record, but to this writer, this is mostly a sleeper of an album as I just can't get into, no matter how loud I played it, and the \r\nartwork wasn't helping either. While written before AC DC's track, the opening Hell's Bells pales in comparison. Bear with me for a \r\nsecond here: while there is no match on the musical expertise and virtuoso qualities of the present track, it lacks soul, personality \r\nand is anything but captivating. All the same, the two-part title track has little effect on me, also. <p>One of the most evident flaws being Stewart's choice of keyboards sounds: they are the ones generally en vogue at the time, but \r\ncompared to previous generations of synths, these here really start sounding \"cheap\". This coupled with the quartet's aspiration to \r\nperfection in terms of virtuosity, renders the whole thing tedious and interesting only to themselves and whoever might be musician \r\nenough to want to imitate this virtuosi perfection. On the positive side is the incredible musicianship (yes, the very one I criticize so \r\nmuch) of the four artistes, their ability to play incredibly tight as unit, etc. But I much prefer early Pat Metheny's albums in the \r\ngenre.<p>While all four musicians have my utmost respect, and I am a fan of many of their previous works (not so familiar with Jeff Berlin's \r\nprevious career though), I can't help but thinking that some of the clich\u00e9s and epithets (musical wankery for ex.) hurled at this kind \r\nof albums have solid grounds and will always stick with such albums. Not any better than Feels Good To Me, this album is not exciting \r\nor only passably interesting, but certainly no more. I fully understand some of the other JR/F enthusiasts calling this type of album \r\nessential, but it simply won't be my case.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=129003#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=129003\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=129003\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, July 17, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #129003)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10439\"><strong>Atavachron</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10439\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10439/Envious-Pear-Print-I10303736.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nCold, indulgent, mechanical, the worst of rock and jazz pushed together with no thought to the proprieties of either form, all these things could be \r\nattributed to Bill Bruford's second solo record.  But that is exactly where its strength rests.  Who says music has to be full of heart and soul?  Almost \r\neveryone.  But therein lies the beauty of this follow-up and why it was one of the best fusion offerings of its day.<p>Tony Williams and John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu had both given us rock's raging heart, RTF and Colosseum l & ll raised the ante and gave us heavy \r\nsymphonic fusion but Bill Bruford's band, made up of four of the finest musicians in the world - maybe *the* finest - was an animal less attached to the \r\ngrimey floor of 'jazz-rock', wanting instead to to live the life robotic, to revel in technical accomplishment not just on their instruments but also in the tone and \r\ndelivery of the music.  There is also a great deal of fun heard here and the sense that these four absolutely loved playing together.  Mathematical as it \r\nmay be, this is an inspired set.  I mean, Dave Stewart, Jeff Berlin, Allan Holdsworth and Bill Bruford... c'mon, it doesn't get much better.  The assembly line \r\nsounds of Stewart's synth pushes off 'Hell's Bells' establishing a crisp sound, and some hip phrasing from his Rhodes piano and faux vibes for parts One \r\n& Two supports the title.  Holdsworth, being the hard-rocker with a John Coltrane heart he is, gives his best chops, Jeff Berlin is his flawless and \r\nuncanny self and Bill holds it all together, in command but not overshadowing.  'Travels With Myself and Someone Else' is pleasant enough middle-of-the-\r\nroad electric jazz and is followed by the clean machinations of 'Fainting in Coils', a stunner with a funeral-organ midsection and crack playing by everyone.  \r\nDespite Berlin's wan gonking, 'Five G' is a successful rocker, 'The Abingdon Chasp' is reasonable, 'Forever Until Sunday' grows into sleak sci-fi rock with a \r\nspastic solo from Allan.  And both parts of 'Sahara of Snow' are ingeniuos rhythmic play, an approprite finish to a spectacular album.<p>It was projects like this (among other things) that caused Bruford's departure from two of Prog Rock's cornerstone bands, and it was well worth it.  A \r\ntriumph, and his finest hour as leader.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=133159#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=133159\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=133159\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, August 14, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #133159)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8691\"><strong>Flucktrot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8691\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070908_201329_joshuatree.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThere's just something different about this album that I can't quite put my finger on.  After reading other reviews, I think\r\nothers have picked up on it too.  My opinion is the unique feel to One of a Kind is partly a function of overproduced 80s,\r\nand partly a function of the perfectionism of the players.  I know this album is listed in the same genre as fusion giants\r\nsuch as Return to Forever and Mahavishnu Orchestra, but this is light-years away in sound from their early recordings (except\r\nI may hear some Romantic Warrior comparisons).  The main reason is that absolutely nothing is out of place on this album--not\r\na note missed, a beat skipped, or an extended note that doesn't have perfect vibrato.  You certainly can't say that about\r\nearly Mahavishnu Orchestra!  The result is that One of a Kind has a sanitized feel, which has obviously left some reviewers\r\ncold and emotionless.  <p>Of course, even if the overall vibe doesn't tug at your heartstrings, you will enjoy One of a Kind.  It really has\r\neverything: varied tempos and time signatures, plenty of variety on synths and keys, lots of catchy melodies, and, most\r\nimportantly, four talented musicians who are on the same page and truly create some killer fusion.  After a terrible start\r\n(what is that grating, repeated banging noise?), the album gets down to business, and things only get better as the album\r\nprogresses.  My favorite tracks (Five G, Abingdon Chasp, Forever Until Sunday, and the Sahara of Snow) are all on the second\r\nside, and packed full of lush synths and oozing Holdsworth guitar.<p>Rather than focus on the songs, I'll focus on the individual performances (though they really do gel to produce a cohesive\r\nsound together).  This album motivated me to find some more of Holdsworth's work--he really works the vibrato and eases into\r\nnotes so seamlessly that his sound is incredibly unique (and enjoyable).  Stewart does a great job on keys, striking a nice\r\nbalance of synths and piano as well as creating some excellent soundscapes (especially on Sahara of Snow).  The rhythm\r\nsection of Bruford and Berlin is so solid that it's very easy to ignore--but when you focus your attention on either, you'll\r\nhave plenty to keep you interested.  I suppose that's the main difference between One of a Kind and the fusion giants: these\r\nguys aren't trying to outplay each other, and it's refreshing.<p>If you like fusion (as I do!), you have to have this album.  I will issue a caution: if you are simply looking at this\r\nbecause Bruford is the lead man, you may be disappointed--although his work is certainly solid, it is never at the\r\nforefront of the music.  However, if you are that big of a Bruford fan, you will also not be surprised at this, because what\r\nmakes him so talented in my eyes is his ability to always add to the music without ever detracting from what the other\r\nplayers are doing (something that can't be said for the other great drummers: Bonham, Cobham, and Portnoy, to name a few).</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156937#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156937\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=156937\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, December 28, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #156937)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>One of its kind</strong><p>One Of A Kind was the second album released under the name Bruford and it is a definite improvement over the debut Feels Good To Me. Admittedly I didn't always rate this album as highly as I do now, but it has grown on me over the years since I first heard it. The leader of Bruford is of course Bill Bruford, drummer of Yes, King Crimson, UK, and several other well-known bands (even including a brief stint with Genesis!). In UK, Bill worked with the inimitable guitarist Allan Holdsworth who also appears here to great effect. The music found on One Of A Kind is nonetheless not all that similar to that of UK as this is much more of a Jazz-Rock/Fusion album. Even so I'm often reminded of Emerson, Lake & Palmer when hearing this album. Keyboards are handled by Dave Stewart and bass guitar by Jeff Berlin. There are no vocals on the album except some out-of-place, annoying spoken word passages on Fainting In Coils, which is taken from Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. This silly piece plays the role of Benny The Bouncer or Are You Ready Eddy from ELP's albums or perhaps The Story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles from Jethro Tull's A Passion Play.  <p>Even if Bill Bruford contributed to better music elsewhere - and there is nothing here that compares with Yes' Close To The Edge or King Crimson's Starless, or even UK's In The Dead Of Night - One Of A Kind is still a very worthy addition to a progressive Rock collection, especially if you are into the jazzier side of the spectrum.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=199861#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=199861\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=199861\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, January 20, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #199861)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5162\"><strong>Evolver</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Crossover &amp; JR/F/Canterbury Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5162\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5162/ec.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is most consistently the best of the Bruford fusion albums.

The Music character of the \r\nband is not an exaggeration of evidence to rise further to the album in the age to say that it \r\nis one. all of be collected musics<p>Music that forms this band in shape to Eddie and John that says that \"U.K.\" is a rock band \r\nand should put it at this time is believed and Bill and Allan that morale integrated by \"U.K.\" \r\nare expressed in natural shape. Various attempt and directionality were achieved in the first \r\nalbum inviting the guest. And, the music character is pursued further and it challenges \r\nmusic high-quality only by four members of the band in this second album. The listener will \r\nbe able to feel that perfection, the arrangement of the tune, and the entire union have \r\nadvanced greatly though the music character draws the flow of the first album. <p>The guitar of Allan is always reformative. However, he also will pursue the original world on \r\nthe boundary of this album. The work of the keyboard of Dave has already been proven in \r\nCanterbury Scene and does certain work with this album. Therefore, the original world \r\nwhere this act can be natural and be done only by these four people including Jeff has \r\nextended. It might be a little difficult to put the definition on this music. However, it can be \r\nguessed that it is a natural flow , considering the situation of music and the flow and the \r\nexample that succeeds most in the deriving flow at this time. All tunes contained in this \r\nalbum have actually splendidly shot knowledge, the situation that each musician \r\nexperienced, and music. They are performing perfectly and naturally as a situation at this \r\ntime. However, it is guessed that they are proofs that put a simple act but the antenna that \r\nalways catches the age and achieve it by the reformation and the exchange when thinking \r\nabout the flow of the music at this time. <p>If a more perfect sound is made from the first album and each musician is not enthusiastic \r\nfor making this album, a lot of sounds not achieved are blocked in this work. \"The Sahara \r\nOf Snow\" guessed to be an already completed in the age of \"U.K.\" This tune is one of the \r\nrepresentatives in live of them. The tune divides into Part1 and 2 and calls impression from \r\nthe tension. As for tune \"Hell's Bells\" of the joint work of Dave and Alan Gowen, the element \r\nthat Gowen cultivated with Gilgamesh is suitable for the band well by compatibility with \r\nDave and four people are finishing it up in a more perfect tune. A tension and a complex \r\narrangement are splendidly reflected in the album by the tune to which \"Fainting In Coils\" \r\nand \"5G\" also draw the flow of the first album. <p>Allan is spoken by the interview, \"A lot of repellent work was experienced\". However, I will \r\nnot believe that it was work with Bill. They are still friends. It mutually has the link and Bill \r\ncontributes the comment on the eulogy to the best album of Allan. And, Bill competes Trio \r\nof \"Kazumi Watanabe\" again in the 80's. Anyway, the highest music that four of these time \r\nthinks about is expressed and this album is made to succeed. Their histories are clarified \r\nlittle by little now by the interview. And, their music might already have been a legend \r\nmomentarily the completion. It might contain the element as which \"U.K.\" is the same. The \r\nperformance done by four people might be painful in the position in which originality is \r\nobviously contained and all genres were exceeded. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=221236#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=221236\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=221236\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 14, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #221236)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is one of those albums that is such a pleasure to listen to. Bruford could almost get \r\nwhoever he wants to play on his albums because he's so respected, so yes we have an all-\r\nstar lineup. Besides one of the best drummers i've ever heard Bill has Dave Stewart of \r\nHATFIELD AND THE NORTH and NATIONAL HEALTH fame on keyboards. Jeff Berlin an \r\nAmerican Jazz bassist who is famous for not only his playing but for turning down a job offer \r\nfrom VAN HALEN. And the great Allan Holdsworth on guitar who's solo career and work with \r\nSOFT MACHINE, Tony Williams and others is well known. A more stripped down affair when \r\ncompared to Bruford's debut, and it seems to work better.<p>\r\n\"Hell's Bells\" is a song Stewart and the late Alan Gowen wrote together, and thankfully we have \r\nthe pleasure to hear it on this album. Pulsating synths with bass as Bruford joins in the \r\nfun. Holdsworth comes in at 1 1/2 minutes as Stewart backs off, he then returns late. \"One Of A \r\nKind Pt 1\" opens with drums and keys before vibes then guitar arrive. It settles and blends \r\ninto \"One Of A Kind Pt 2\" where it stays calm as drums and other sounds come and go. It's \r\nbuilding 1 1/2 minutes in. Guitar after 3 minutes then a big finish. \"Travels With Myself-And \r\nSomeone Else\" is pastoral early with piano. The bass before 2 1/2 minutes is prominant. Lots \r\nof keyboards in this one. Drums and guitar become more of the focus later. \"Fainting In Coils\" \r\nopens with spoken words before the music kicks in. This sounds really good then it \r\nlightens. This contrasts continues. The guitar is excellent. Organ after 3 minutes as it \r\nsettles. Cool sound (Stewart) after 4 1/2 minutes then it kicks in again. \"Five G\" has a nice bass \r\nintro and I like the drumming too. Check out the guitar after 1 1/2 minutes. <p>\"The Abingdon \r\nChasp\" is led by drums, piano and bass early. Guitar before 2 minutes then the tempo picks \r\nup. \"Forever Until Sunday\" is a moving piece because of guest Eddie Jobson's violin \r\nplaying. A change before 3 minutes as the tempo picks up and it gets fuller. It ends as it began \r\nbut instead of violin it's guitar. Cool. \"The Sahara Of Snow Pt 1\" is spacey to open then we get \r\nsome piano after a minute followed by drums and a full sound. Nice. Vibes too. Bruford is \r\namazing here. Holdsworth's turn 2 1/2 minutes in then it gets spacey again before kicking back \r\nin. Great sound. \"The Sahara Of Snow Pt 2\" has a heavier sound to it with clapping. It works \r\nactually then the guitar starts to play over top. I like it. Check out Holdsworth and Bruford here.<p>\r\nA very good Jazz / Fusion album all around.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=232106#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=232106\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=232106\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, August 17, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #232106)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25551\"><strong>snobb</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25551\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25551/psychiatrist.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI listened this, second, Bruford solo album straight after I finished with his first one. <p>No Anette Peackock's vocal, no horns, more difficult rhythms and structures - I can see world \r\nclass fusion at the level of best Return To Forever albums.<p>OK, starting from here I feel more and more cold in Brufford work, more technics, less \r\nemotions.

The material here is in\r\nfact slightly superior compared to the debut but I can't help but think of <em>One Of A Kind</em> as\r\njust an improvement to the debut album. The material is better but there isn't really anything new\r\nor groundbreaking about this album.<p>\r\n<em>Hell's Bells</em> might not give the same kick-start as the intro of <em>Beelzebub</em> and instead\r\nshows us a slightly different take on an album opener that suits the material even better than an\r\nup-tempo composition would have done. The intro track is followed by the album-titled composition\r\nwhich, once again, is split into two parts. This track could just as well have been released as\r\ncoherent piece and the only possible explanation I can think of was that the band did not want to\r\nextend a composition's duration to longer than 6,5 minutes. This notion is of course strange since\r\nthe previous album featured two tracks that were longer than 7 minutes each.<p>\r\n<em>Five G</em> is a flashy bass extravaganza where Jeff Berlin finally gets a shot at the spotlight\r\nand shows everything that he is capable of. This is probably also my personal favorite track off\r\nthis album because I just can't get enough of that lead-melody and all the transformations it\r\nundergoes during the performance.<p>\r\nAt the end of the day I still consider <em>One Of A Kind</em> just a slightly superior reworking of\r\nthe debut album which is by no means a bad thing. Maybe it's just my high expectations on a band\r\nconsisting of Bruford/Berlin/Holdsworth/Stewart to go where no man has gone before that makes it\r\ndifficult for me to see past some of the album's limitations and awarding it anything higher than a\r\n4-star rating.<p>**** star songs: Hell's Bells (3:33) Five G (4:46) Forever Until Sundary (5:51)<p>**** star songs: One Of A Kind, Pt. 1 (2:20) One Of A Kind, Pt. 2 (4:04) Fainting In Coils (6:34)\r\nThe Abingdon Chasp (4:54) The Sahara Of Snow, Pt. 1 (5:18) The Sahara Of Snow, Pt. 2 (3:25)<p>*** star songs: Travels With Myself - And Someone Else (6:13)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=269989#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=269989\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=269989\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, March 7, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #269989)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBruford's second album is a typical end 70s release illustrating how fusion mellowed out to harmless\r\nbackground music. The tension and improvisational freedom of the highly productive early 70s have\r\nbeen entirely replaced by overstated Miami Vice-synths, velvety production values and melodies that\r\nare so easy on the ears that it becomes annoying.  <p>Annoying to me at least, as this album seems to be massively popular and is considered a masterpiece\r\nby everyone, a few lost sheep excepted. There's some flashy musicianship to justify its status but I\r\nfind this  music to be cold, formulaic, devoid of feeling, unexciting and way too radio-friendly.\r\nMaybe the popularity comes from the emphasis on melody and synths, or maybe it's just the names on\r\nthe flipside. Yes, I really wonder if anybody would have bothered with this release if it had been\r\nby less popular musicians. <p>Anyway, if this album brings people to fusion then it serves a good purpose. But on the other hand,\r\nthis happened to be the album (together with Weather Report's <em>Heavy Weather</em>) that drove me\r\naway from it and made me stop listening to fusion for more then 20 years. That's how much I hated\r\nwhat I was hearing, and I still do.<p>Don't expect anything hinting at the powerful music Bruford created with Yes and Crimson, but if you\r\ndon't mind mellow and easy-listening jazz, the album is quite a treat apparently. In order to keep\r\nany perspective against the stellar music in the jazz-rock section, I really can't give this\r\nsoft-fusion more then 2 stars. And then I'm still being generous.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=304209#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=304209\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=304209\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, October 15, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #304209)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBill Bruford's continued excursion into the burgeoning and exciting world of electrified percussion using a jazzier prog medium--and a band of incredibly technically accomplished musicians. You would be hard-pressed to put together a band of more proficient instrumentalists than bassist Jeff BERLIN, keyboard wizard Dave STEWART, guitar genius Allan HOLDSWORTH and, of course, drummer unparalleled, Bill Bruford. Gone is mysterious chanteuse Annette PEACOCK (whose talents I actually love) and gone, too, are any attempts at songs with vocals. This is an experimental jazz fusion album. Accordingly, it takes the listener some time to become familiar and friendly to the sometimes obtuse or oblique sounds and styles of the music and musicians. But, if you put in the effort, I think that you will find this album well worth it. <p>\"The Sahara of Snow, Parts 1 & 2\" Is probably one of my ten favorite prog songs of all-time--and definitely the best Allan Holdworth soloing ever.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=406692#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=406692\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=406692\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, February 23, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #406692)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBill Bruford - One of a Kind (1979)<p>Former Yes & King Crimson member Bill Bruford's second album under his own name is a \r\ntypical fusion album with a modern eighties sound (though released in '79). Whilst under the \r\nflag of Bruford, this is actually a record by a super-group consisting of Bruford on drums, \r\nHolsworth on guitar (the famous jazz shredder), Stewart on keyboards (the Canterbury legend) \r\nand Berlin on bass. <p>It's kind of funny how my opinion on this album lies exactly between that of Bonnek and Snobb. \r\nI also must admit that I think the sound of this album is very non-stylish. The choice of synths is \r\noften a bit annoying and the overall recording is a bit too clean. Using xylophones is also \r\nsomething I can't like in any fusion-record. Besides that, this is a highly technical achievement \r\nand most of the compositions are quite strong too! Many tracks have strong atmospheres or \r\ninteresting forms. All musicians shine in their roles, except... Bruford himself. I can't find a \r\nsingle passage in which he leads! The music is dominated by Stewart and Holdsworth. <p>Conclusion. Don't expect meaningful compositions with relevant titles, don't expect to hear \r\nCrimson of Mahavishnu heaviness, but engage on this record if you like the technical or/and \r\nsymphonic approach to fusion. Perhaps fans of UK will be very enthusiastic too. The music \r\ndoes get exciting, melodic and some guitar solo's of Holdsworth keep impressing me. Three \r\nand halve stars. There aren't that many 'progressive fusion' records that stay in my collection for \r\nlong, but this is one of them.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=478713#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=478713\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=478713\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 8, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #478713)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBlending the Canterbury-influenced style of Feels Good to Me with the more straight-ahead fusion of the first UK album should have resulted in a dynamite hit. However, One of a Kind is hampered from being better than merely \"good\" by several factors. First off, Dave Stewart's keyboards - it's not the way he plays them, which is as competent and skilled as ever, but some of the digital synths used sound horribly dated nowadays - even compared to keyboards he played on the first Egg album a decade earlier! This is particularly prominent on the opening track; dig deeper and you will find better synthesiser textures hidden beneath.<p>Secondly, the production job on the album is smooth, polished, professional and inoffensive - and castrates the album just when it needs to rock the hell out, as on the should-be-foreboding closing track The Sahara of Snow. On balance, not as good as its predecessor, though still worth it if you are a fan of the musicians involved.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=561084#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=561084\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=561084\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, November 1, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #561084)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20541\"><strong>Negoba</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20541\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20541/devin1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nDrifting Toward Muzak<p>I should love this album. The all-star lineup includes my favorite prog key player, one of my \r\nfavorite fusion guitarists, and a monster rhythm section. Alas, the date (1979) dominates \r\nthis record's sound and we are left with a toothless, dated record that shows some hints at \r\nwhat could have been but ultimately disappoints. <p>In 1979, the aesthetic of music was in full transition mode. Synthesizers were changing to a \r\ncomputer age goofiness, production techniques were getting glossier, reverbs were getting \r\nhuge. Jazz fusion in general was getting softer, more brainy, and less dangerous. ONE OF \r\nA KIND is an enormous victim of these trends. The primary victim is Dave Stewart, whose \r\nmonster contributions in the Canterbury scene had a distincitve set of tones including a \r\ndistorted organ sound that was nasty and organic. Here, his tones are so processed and \r\nwhite washed that you can barely tell it's him. Similarly, the drum and bass are occasionally \r\neffected into complete cheese. Sadly, this was a trend. Allan Holdsworth's later work is very \r\nmuzaked and his mind-boggling heir apparent Shawn Lane would play almost exclusively \r\nin this defanged sound. Some of jazz's best players like Pat Metheny and Bela Fleck / Victor \r\nWooten have records that are almost unlistenable unless you tolerate 80's elevators.<p>There is indeed some great playing on this record. The late tracks actually have some \r\nmenace here and there. There are some nice riffs, and the musicianship is at a very high \r\nlevel. Holdsworth is very comfortable in his element here, maybe too much so. Bruford is \r\nsolidly slippery as always. Berlin is a madman. Stewarts playing is actually quite nice, \r\nwhen you listen for the note choices and block out the tone. <p>But the fact is that tone is the first thing that leaves an impression on the listener. The \r\ntimbre of a singer's voice, the sing of a guitar note. The snap of a snare. And of course the \r\nsound of a keyboard. Here it's just unpleasant. As I listen to Stewart's solo on \"Travels With \r\nMyself...\" with it's faux steel drum, I yearn for the nasty Khan organ. <p>As I'm forcing myself to listen to the album for this review, the playing does come through. \r\nBut in general, I never make it through the album. The fact is that all of these players have \r\nso many examples of great playing elsewhere, in more palatable settings. <p>Huge disappointment.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=642135#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=642135\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=642135\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, February 27, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #642135)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=40189\"><strong>FragileKings</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=40189\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/40189/marble.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI love Bill Bruford's playing with Yes and I heard some great stuff with King Crimson. Furthermore, I enjoy \r\nhearing him speak on music documentaries. I read his autobiography and he cited \"One of a Kind\" as a favourite \r\nalbum, along with King Crimson's \"Red\" which I also like. Then in Stephen Lambe's book, \"Citizens of Hope and \r\nGlory: the Story of Progressive Rock,\" the album is mentioned as one of 65 albums worthy of hearing. My \r\ncuriosity piqued, I ordered the album earlier this year.<p><p>The album opens with a quick steady beat on what sounds like an early electronic drum or a large sheet of thick \r\nplastic and is presently joined by a jolly synthesizer rhythm that made me think, \"Oh, good gravy, no! Not another \r\nCozy Powell!\"<p><p>Several years ago, I bought \"Over the Top\", an album by Cozy Powell that featured Don Airey, Gary Moore, and \r\npossibly a guest appearance by Jeff Beck if I recall correctly. I had high expectations but the album was almost \r\nembarrassing to play. Most of the music was written by Airey (who I think is a remarkable player) and was almost \r\nlike supermarket muzak in sound with added classical and jazz references. Blame the synthesizer sound. I might \r\nhave played the album through twice before finally selling it and deleting it entirely from my iTunes library.<p><p>Fortunately for Bruford and me, the music of this track does become less embarrassing and more enjoyable, \r\nthough for a piece of music with a title like \"Hells Bells\" I would have expected something less like a pop song \r\ntreated to muzak and then mixed with jazz.<p><p>The rest of the album sounds better most of the time. The main problem I have here is that jazz / rock is not \r\nsomething I have added to my music collection prior (except for Dixie Dregs) so I have a hard time loving the \r\ntunes as much as someone with a developed lexicon in Canterbury and other forms of jazz fusion rock. \"One of  \r\nKind\" has a tendency for each track to sound a little similar to the others. Of course they are all distinct. The first \r\n30 seconds of each track will tell you that. But there's a kind of formula that insists that each track have some \r\ndrama somewhere, some melody somewhere, some slower lounge jazz parts, and some flash solos. Just hit \r\nshuffle.<p><p>Bruford doesn't try to show off as he did when he was younger. Instead he chooses safe 4/4 beats much of the \r\ntime and adds in fills when required. The times his playing perks up my ears is usually a well-timed and effective \r\ndrum fill as the music transfers from one part to another. In his autobiography, however, he said that he was \r\nhappy to write music and work it over with talented musicians and let them create the fabulous music out of his \r\noffering. I would say that he has achieved that here.<p><p>Allan Holdsworth is of course a wizard during his solos. His technique clearly must have inspired many young \r\nguitarists who would contribute to the sound of the rock guitar in hair metal bands in the 80's. There is again a \r\nkind of sameness at that crops up at times. Holdsworth will play a few melodic notes and then do a quick run of \r\nfingers over the fret board on many of the tracks. \"Five G\" features some fuzz tone playing that is a nice variation \r\non the album. Basically, I'm left with the impression that Holdsworth can do amazing things with the guitar but \r\nrepeats himself frequently.<p><p>Dave Stewart uses a variety of sounds from his polysynthesizers, some of them more effective and pleasing than \r\nothers. \"One of a Kind\" part one employs a keyboard setting that sounds really dated. I can't imagine how they \r\nthought this sound was a good one. \"Byown, byown\" go the keyboards. \"Hey, great sound. Let's use it on the \r\nalbum.\" His choice for sound setting in \"Travels with Myself - And Someone Else\" includes what must have been \r\nlabelled as \"flute\" or \"clarinet\" but like so many early and also cheaper synthesizers these days too, it doesn't \r\nreally sound like what it is supposed to sound like. All the same, Stewart makes it work here. \"The Abingdon \r\nChasp\" includes some pleasant lounge jazz piano as well in parts.<p><p>Jeff Berlin deserves mention as the guy cannot be allowed to play just an ordinary bass line on any track that I \r\nnoticed. His genius as a bass player really shows through even when he's just playing the bass behind the \r\nsoloists. He also gets a cool bass intro on \"Five G\" and a frenetic solo elsewhere.<p><p>Though there are a few tracks that have moments that sound great to my ears, the composition to win it for me is \r\n\"Fainting in Coils\". It has a dark beginning and some terrific jazzy keyboards. Parts are light and simple, others \r\ndarker and suspenseful. This track treads over a few different terrains and serves as a great summary of the \r\nalbum while holding enough excitement to stand out as the pick of the litter. Everyone really lays into it for the \r\nconclusion. Aside from this track, there are excellent parts to crop up throughout the album and tracks like \"The \r\nSahara of Snow\" parts one and two and \"Five G\" are also very good examples of this band's abilities.<p><p>Though the music may sound a little repetitive at times and I am quite the novice at this point, I still think the \r\nplaying is superior. I personally can't quite feel obliged to give it four stars because I find it hard to consider this \r\nas an excellent addition to just any prog collection as there are surely people like me who can't quite be so \r\nthrilled about the jazz element. On the other hand, if you love jazz fusion, jazz, or Canterbury then this might just \r\nbe not only an excellent addition but an essential one. So take note that my three stars are for my taste \r\npersonally and I fully recommend this album to anyone more inclined to appreciate it.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1280544#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1280544\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1280544\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, September 20, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1280544)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15596\"><strong>stefro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15596\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15596/STEF.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nA much-admired yet occasionally criticized slice of progressive jazz-fusion, the second album from Bill Bruford's group picks \r\nup pretty much where debut predecessor 'Feels Good To Me' left off. Featuring crisp production values, a synthesizer-heavy \r\nsound and some dazzling technical play, 'One Of A Kind', despite its general excellence, seems to be a true marmite album. \r\nThe reason? The era of its creation. Issued in the post-punk days 1979, 'One Of A Kind' came pretty late-in-the-day for a jazz \r\nfusion album, and at a time when many progressive-minded groups were going through a period of rapid change. Stylistically \r\nat least, this didn't seem to affect Bruford, yet the technology and production techniques of 1979 had moved on considerably \r\nsince the days of 'Third' and 'Elastic Rock' and as a result there is many an old-school fusion fan who simply cannot accept \r\nthe shiny, synthesized sheen or gated drums found throughout the album. True, 'One Of A Kind' maybe lacks the deeply \r\ncosmic ambience of the genre's very best efforts, but you really shouldn't let that put you off. \r\nOnce again joined by ex-Soft Machine guitarist Allan Holdsworth, bassist Jeff Berlin and former Caravan and National Health \r\nkeyboardist Dave Stewart, Bill Bruford's commitment to producing truly progressive fusion isn't in question, and his band \r\ndemonstrate their individual and collective skills with a quite superb collection of tunes. Yes, it sounds a bit 1980's, but so \r\nwhat. The actual melodies, breaks and rhythms belong in the same class as the likes of Nucleus, Soft Machine and Return To \r\nForever, and, unlike early-eighties supergroup Asia, which featured four prog-rock legends and authentic Roger Dean artwork \r\nyet actually produced nothing more than lightweight pop-rock, this is no ersatz legend meet designed to drum up profile and \r\ncash. It's the real thing. \r\nHighlights abound, yet for the purists both the snazzy opening rhymes of 'Hell's Bells' and Bruford's own two-part piece 'The \r\nSahara Of Snow' showcase the quartet at their very best. Indeed, there is a rarely a duff moment to be found, and even when \r\nthe group lean deeply into rockier realms they maintain a deep sense of jazzy menace, as the six-minute 'Fainting In Coils' \r\ndemonstrates. If it's Mingus, Coltrane and Baker you dig then maybe 'One Of A Kind' isn't for you. However, those with a \r\npenchant for the cosmic strains of Chick Corea or Miles Davis circa his electric period could be in for a treat. \r\nSTEFAN TURNER, STOKE NEWINGTON, 2015</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1361762#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1361762\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1361762\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, February 4, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1361762)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=997\"><strong>Guillermo</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=997\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070426_101555_eclipse-mex-110.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter trying  for several years to find his \"best musical identity\"  in his musical career after the split of KING \r\nCRIMSON in late 1974, BILL BRUFORD, by the late seventies  at last found it (in my opinion), leading his BRUFORD  band to \r\nrecord this all instrumental (without vocals) very good Jazz-Rock /  Fusion album in 1979. In fact, it was his second \"solo\" album, with \"Feels Good to \r\nMe\" (which was recorded in 1977 but was released in January 1978) being his first real solo album. But, with the \"One of a Kind\"  album \r\nbeing really an album recorded under the BRUFORD band's name, with more songwriting collaborations from \r\nDave Stewart, Jeff Berlin and Allan Holdsworth, all of which also contributed to the \"Feels Good to Me\", album but with \r\nthat album really being released under BILL BRUFORD's name than as an album recorded as a band.<p>Why I said before that BILL BRUFORD found his \"real musical identity\" with this album (and also with \"Feels \r\nGood To Me\")? He  said in interviews that while he previously played with a lot of Prog Rock bands, he really \r\nwas a Jazz drummer playing Rock music. This somewhat \"strange mixture\" of musical styles for him as a \r\ndrummer really worked very well while he worked with these bands, with him contributing very good drums \r\nplaying with very good technique. But for the  \"Feels Good to Me\" and \"One of a Kind\" albums, he really was composing, \r\nplaying and recording very good Jazz-Rock / Fusion music by the late seventies. It really was a long \"journey\" for him to \r\nreally play the kind of music that he most liked, I think, since he started to be a professional musician in 1968.<p>While he was playing with the band \"U.K. \" (with Holdsworth, Eddie Jobson and John Wetton) , he played two of his songs on tour with \r\nthat band, both of  which he later recorded with the BRUFORD band for the \"One of a Kind\" album: \"Forever Until \r\nSunday\" and \"The Sahara of Snow (Parts 1 and 2)\". He said in one interview that \r\nJobson and  Wetton didn't want to record those songs for the then planned second \"U.K\". album with Bruford and Holdsworth (which in the end was titled \"Danger Money\" and was recorded with Terry Bozzio replacing Bruford but without Holdsworth being replaced). Some live \r\nrecordings of their 1978 tour show the band playing both songs, and those recordings show the conflicts that the \r\nband had, with Holdsworth and Bruford wanting to play Jazz Rock / Fusion music, while Jobson and Wetton \r\nwanted to play Prog Rock music (and in the case of  Wetton, also Pop Rock music). So, both Bruford and \r\nHoldsworht left \"U.K.\" (or were \"fired\", as Bruford said)  in late 1978 to form the BRUFORD band. Anyway, for \r\nthe recording of  \"Forever Until Sunday  which was included in the \"One of a Kind\" album, Bruford invited \r\nJobson (then uncredited in the record sleeve to avoid \"confusion\", as Jobson said in one interview) to play the \r\nviolin part. But Jobson also was credited as songwriter with Bruford  in the part 2 of  \"Sahara of Snow\", but Jobson \r\ndidn't appear playing  in that song. Anyway, \"Forever Until Sunday\" and \"The Sahara of Snow\" were recorded for this \r\nalbum with almost the same arrangements that \"U.K.\" played in their 1978 tour.<p>This \"One of a Kind\" album, in my opinion,  has some more complicated music than the \"Feels Good to \r\nMe\"album, showing that BILL BRUFORD really improved as a composer since then (\"with a litle help from \r\nhis friends\" in some songs). But BILL BRUFORD was the main composer and leader in this band. But he let his \r\nfriends record some of their songs: \"Hell's Bells\" is a song composed by Stewart (with Alan Gowen); \"The \r\nAbingdom Chasp\" was composed by Holdsworth alone. Some of the other songs have songwriting \r\ncontributions from the other members of the band: \"One of a Kind Part 2\" was composed by Bruford with \r\nStewart; \"Five G\" was composed by Bruford with Berlin and Stewart. But the rest of the songs were composed \r\nby Bill Bruford alone.<p>This album has a very good recording and mixing, with all the members of the band playing very well. Jeff \r\nBerlin really shines as bass player in this album.<p>This is a very good Jazz-Rock  / Fusion album. Maybe it sounds \"very late seventies\" in musical style, but it is \r\nvery good anyway.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1584639#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1584639\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1584639\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, July 3, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1584639)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=56081\"><strong>VianaProghead</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=56081\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/1/cover_404762112008.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" title=\"VianaProghead avatar\" width=100 alt=\"VianaProghead avatar\" onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n                                    Review N\u00ba 230<p>Bill Bruford is one of the most famous and recognized drummers of the world and he was one of the founder \r\nmembers of Yes, a member of King Crimson and a founder member of U.K. Beyond that, he participated in several \r\nmusical projects and performed live with Genesis, he returned to King Crimson and Yes, performed with his ex-\r\ncolleagues of Yes, Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe and Patrick Moraz, and also with the American band \r\nPavlov's Dog. These are only some of his most important musical contributions to our loved universe of the \r\nprogressive rock music.<p>So, Bruford was, undoubtedly, one of the founders of the progressive rock music and he bought new ideas to it, \r\nwith rock, jazz and orchestral techniques. According to Digital Dream Door, Bruford is the seventh greatest rock \r\ndrummer of all time. Bruford is also considered as one of the most influential drummers ever existed and his \r\ntechnique and influence are considered at the same level such as Neil Pearl of Rush, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, \r\nKeith Moon of The Who, Carl Palmer of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Ian Paice of Deep Purple, or in our days, Mike \r\nPortnoy of Dream Theater.<p>'One Of A Kind' is the second solo studio album of Bill Bruford and was released in 1979. This album was released \r\none year later, after Bill Bruford having participated in the release of U.K., the eponymous debut studio album of \r\nU.K., the super-group he helped to form with three other great progressive rock musicians, the guitarist Allan \r\nHoldsworth, the keyboardist and violinist Eddie Jobson and the bassist and vocalist John Wetton.<p>So, the line up of the album is Bill Bruford (drums and percussion), Allan Holdsworth (electric guitar), Dave Stewart \r\n(keyboards and synthesizers) and Jeff Berlin (bass).<p>Some of the material recorded on this album, despite never was been released on any studio album of U.K., was \r\noriginally performed live in the 1978 live tour of U.K. It happens with the track 'Forever Until Sunday', which \r\nfeatures an unaccredited Jobson work on violin, and with the ninth and tenth tracks 'The Sahara Of The Snow, Pt 1 \r\nand 2'. By the other hand, the track 'Hell's Bells' used a fragment of a song original composed by the former and \r\noriginal colleague of Stewart, Alan Gowen, when both were members of the Canterbury scene band, founded in \r\n1975, National Health.<p>By the time when 'One Of A Kind' was recorded, two years later, the core group from 'Feels Good To Me' has \r\nbecame even more focused. Bruford restricted himself to the drum kit, likely in an effort to create a recording that \r\ncould be more easily reproduced when performed live. Gone too, were the vocals and added trumpet, further \r\nindications that Bruford was looking at the group as a viable touring entity. Since Stewart has gone from National \r\nHealth and Holdsworth was back from the time spent in the U.S.A. with Tony Williams, it seemed as though that \r\neverything was lining up.<p>The same characteristics founded on his debut studio album 'Feels Good To Me' are evident on 'One Of A Kind', \r\nwith everyone demonstrating palpable growth. Holdsworth's style, as distinctive as it is, would ultimately evolve into \r\nsomething more abstract that would, in some ways, alienate some of his core audience. But at this point he is still \r\neminently approachable, equally capable of relaxed and flowing lines as he is able of rapid-fire exchanges. Jeff \r\nBerlin finds the comfortable middle-ground, with a formidable technique that never seems on display for the sake \r\nof it. Stewart continues to avoid the trappings of his contemporaries like Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman, with a \r\nconception that is clearly broader than both and an interest in the ensemble that demonstrates a kind of a \r\nrefreshing lack of his ego.<p>The compositions on 'One Of A Kind' are even more episodic than those on 'Feels Good To Me', and in many ways, \r\nmore challenging. And yet, despite a landscape of constantly shifting meters and tempi, the magic of 'One Of A \r\nKind' is that it remains a compelling and an accessible work, despite its complexity. The irregular meters are so \r\ncomfortably executed and in-the-pocket that unless one is paying attention, nobody doesn't really notice all that all. \r\nThe solos flow organically throughout the long form compositions, integrated in ways that makes them feel a part \r\nof the larger whole even though, in performance, it would become clear just of how of much freedom was being \r\nafforded to all.<p>Conclusion: 'One Of A Kind' is a collection of progressive rock songs with a jazz exploration, which latter would be \r\ndefined as jazz/rock fusion. This is an excellent album with twists and turns around its music, punctuated by \r\nBruford's steadying and slightly subversive rhythms, Holdsworth's flashes of fire, Berlin's insistent line bass and \r\nStewart's remarkably colourful keyboard work. 'One Of A Kind' is an album I bought some years ago and I always \r\nconsidered it an excellent album. It's commonly accepted that it's his best solo work and that it's also one of the \r\nbest albums of the jazz/rock fusion. This is an album with the same quality of the best albums of Mahavishnu \r\nOrchestra, Herbie Hancock, Brand X, Jean-Luc Ponty, Santana, Billy Cobham, Al Di Meola, Miles Davies, Return To \r\nForever and Weather Report.<p>Prog is my Ferrari.

The Bruford group, with Allan Holdsworth on the six-string, aims to find out on \"One of a Kind, part 1\" from their second album, <em>One of a Kind</em>. Turns out it <em>is</em> possible, and they deploy some of that late-1970s/early-1980s smoothness not only on this song, but throughout the LP: wizardly guitar soloing over those standard-issue chord changes played on a synth. Nice enough, but we expect more from Bruford.\r\n<p>\r\nLuckily, they give us more. There are three Bruford classics here: \"Hells Bells\" and each of the two parts of \"The Sahara of Snow.\" And there are two other strong offerings, \"Fainting in Coils\" and \"5G,\" both of which showcase bassist Jeff Berlin. Much of the other half of <em>One of a Kind</em> is fusion-lite with occasional prog-rock forays.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough Holdsworth's playing here is rightfully praised, ex-National Health keyboardist Dave Stewart is the keystone on most of the tracks, and at least for  <em>One of a Kind</em>, the group could just as fairly be called Stewart.\r\n<p>\r\nOn the whole, <em>One of a Kind</em> is a good album and a slight improvement over the group's debut, <em>Feels Good to Me</em> (1977). Most of the best songs on these two LPs are also on the 1979 live album <em>The Bruford Tapes</em>, which I'd ordinarily recommend as a starting point for this group. However, while the performances on <em>The Bruford Tapes</em> are great, the sound quality isn't, and at least one track is incomplete.\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile, the Bruford group's third and final studio album, the relatively rock-oriented <em>Gradually Going Tornado</em>, is their best, but fusion fans will likely find more to like on this album and on <em>Feels Good to Me</em>.\r\n<p>\r\nP.S.: <em>One of a Kind</em> is a must for Rototom fans. Having largely abandoned mallet percussion for this album, Bruford relies on a set of Rototoms to lend some tonality to his playing.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2234059#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2234059\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2234059\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, June 29, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2234059)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=27874\"><strong>TCat</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=27874\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/27874/4150874369_330_1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBill Bruford returns on this sophomore release of his band \"Bruford\", this time without any special guests, only his \r\ncore quartet.  But that is all we need here as this time around, the technical jazz/rock sound is amazing and the \r\ntalents of each of the individuals in the quartet really shines.  <p>I think I'm safe to say that most people here would already know that Bill Bruford came to prominence with his drum \r\nwork with \"Yes\" and \"U.K.\"  When Burford left \"U.K.\" he spent more time making his own music, and Alan Holdsworth \r\ncame with him taking half of the original, unique \"U.K.\" band's sound with them.  The reason I was originally \r\ninterested in this album was for that reason.  Even though I love U.K.'s \"Danger Money\", you can tell there is a slight \r\ndifference in the sound between that album and the self-titled album.  In this album, I hoped for a sort-of 3rd U.K. \r\nstudio album, and because of this, I was initially disappointed.  But the more I listened to Bruford's \"One of a Kind\", \r\nthe more I loved it until now I consider it right up there with the U.K. albums.  There are some tracks where that \r\nsound really stands out, however, so I would highly recommend this album to anyone that loves the original U.K. \r\nalbum, just don't expect an exact clone all of the time because even though Holdsworth is also along for the ride, \r\nDave Stewart brings along some of his own keyboard styles that make this album a bit more jazz fusion oriented \r\n(that's not a bad thing at all), and mostly unknown bassist (at least at the time of this release) Jeff Berlin would prove \r\nthat he was just as great as the other more familiar musicians in this quartet.  It is Berlin's work with Bruford that \r\nwould propel him to much more notoriety.  <p>Here is the breakdown of the tracks on the album:<p> \r\nHell's Bells - Written by Dave Stewart, this one includes a three chord pattern that can be heard during Holdsworth's \r\nexcellent guitar solo in the middle of the track.  That pattern comes from Stewart's colleague Alan Gowen of \"National \r\nHealth\".  Stewart's synth work is a bit new age-y and might even sound a bit dated, but the tricky rhythm structure \r\nhere more than makes up for that.  Don't worry, though, this one is fairly short and is the weakest on the album.  The \r\nrest of the album is quite amazing.<p>One of a Kind, Pt. 1 - This has more of the U.K. vibe on it especially during the Holdsworth solos.  Again you get that \r\ngreat complex rhythm and the keyboards and tonal percussion sounds much better on this track, not as dated as the \r\nprevious track.  This ends when the first melodic idea breaks down and?<p>One of a Kind, Pt. 2 begins with a more improvised sound and turns to a minimal feel with the instruments playing \r\nsofter and building as the amazing guitar pushes it all forward.  Bill's unique way of drumming can make this complex \r\nmeter sound more straightforward than it is, and that is one of his talents that really stands out here.  The tempo \r\ntakes off again during the last half of this track eventually returning to the original theme for a short time at the end.<p>Travels with Myself -- And Someone Else - This is a nice, mellow fusion track with the piano and keys taking the lead at \r\nfirst, and then giving way to some amazing bass from Jeff Berlin, who was pretty much unheard of prior to his tenure \r\nwith \"Bruford\", but as a result of his performances with this project, came to prominence and built his reputation \r\nfrom this.  Again, the meters are ever changing, especially in the middle of the track, and Bruford pumps out his \r\namazing kaleidoscopic drum patterns throughout.<p>Fainting in Coils - This track has some dramatic readings from Bill (Mock Turtle), Sam Alder (narrator) and Anthea \r\nNorman Taylor (Alice) during the first part of the track while the instruments support in a non-typical way.   The \r\ninstrumentals take over and turn this track into a prog-lover's dream.  The bass is quite amazing once again and the \r\nsynths create some really nice passages, but the band and instrumentation is exceptional throughout the track.  This \r\nis probably the most dynamic and complex of the tracks on the album, and that's saying a lot.  <p>Five G - Co-written by bassist Jeff Berlin, this is the only track on the album where he shares co-writing credit.  The \r\ntrack begins with a complex and upbeat sound with Berlin shining through right from the start, but everyone gets to \r\nshine in this track as Holdsworth plays like his fingers are on fire, yet Berlin keeps up with him quite admirably.  It's \r\ntracks like this on the album that prove that Berlin needs to be recognized and you can see why his playing caught \r\neveryone's attention.<p>The Abingdon Chasp  - This one is completely written by Holdsworth, the only track giving him writing credit.  It's \r\neverything you would expect from Holdsworth, complex progressive jazz with his signature sound.<p>Forever Until Sunday - This track, along with the remainder of the tracks on the album, were all originally meant for \r\nU.K., but since Bill Bruford wrote them, he took the songs with him when he left U.K.  This track even features the \r\nviolin part that Eddie Jobson played for the U.K. unreleased version, here re-recorded specifically for this Bruford \r\nalbum.  It is a bit more mellow than you would expect considering it was considered for inclusion on U.K.'s 2nd \r\nalbum, but the violin backed by the bass is simply beautiful, with that somewhat enticingly cold and metallic sound \r\nthat U.K. had.  It's a nice slow burner of a track, almost romantic, but with Jobson's signature violin sound.  Halfway \r\nthrough, the beat picks up a bit and the synth and bass work together to build tension and intensity with Holdsworth \r\nguitar finally churning up the whole thing in the last section of the track.<p>The Sahara of Snow, Pt. 1 - Again, Bruford originally wrote this for the U.K. sophomore album, but instead used it \r\nhere.  It all starts out cold and expansive, sort of like \"Alaska\", but with a drone-like quality and interesting effects.  A \r\nfast and repeating keyboard riff builds up the intensity until the drums kick in and the piano and tonal percussion \r\ntake things spiraling along like the wind spirals the snow hinted at in the title.  As it builds more, it sounds more like \r\nsomething you would have heard on the non-existent U.K. album, and is quite satisfying to those wishing for \r\nsomething more from that short-lived band.  Things calm down to almost minimal levels and we move into?.<p>The Sahara of Snow, Pt. 2 - The piano riff comes back, a bit trickier now and things take off quickly this time.  This one \r\nwas co-written with Eddie Jobson, even though he doesn't appear on the track, yet it definitely feels like a strong U.K. \r\ntrack.  Part way through, the track moves to a heavy, mid-tempo rhythm that the piano surprisingly pushes along \r\nquite effectively as Holdsworth churns out another amazing solo.  This is one that will satisfy those rabid U.K. fans \r\nthat want more and is worth getting the album for if you haven't completely been convinced yet, that is.  <p>Except for the weaker first track, this is a strong and impressive album that also helps fill the gaps left from the \r\noriginal U.K., but also sets a new style and sound in motion in the progressive fusion world.  It doesn't seem that most \r\nof the U.K. fans didn't make the transition over to Bruford like both Bill Bruford and Allan Holdsworth did, but that \r\nonly means there are a lot of fans out there that would probably be quite surprised by this album, and I think it is \r\ndefinitely worth while for them to check it out.  For me, I love this album first on it's own merits, and the fact that a \r\nfew of the tracks bring back memories of the great U.K. lineup is only the icing on the cake.  This is one of those \r\nalbums that should be recognized much more in prog circles and fusion circles for that matter.  This is amazing \r\nmusic!\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2576560#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2576560\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2576560\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 5, 2021</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=4745#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2576560)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOne of the best Bruford solo outputs, if not the best one, together with \"Feels good to me\".\r\n\"One of a kind\" proves Bruford's capabilities not only as a drummer but also a band member and composer.

Same line-up as on Feels Good.  Same \r\neverything!!!  This is a totally killer performance by one of the greatest bands of players \r\nthe world will likely never see together again...!  Get this one and have a blast!\r\n...

If you love analog keyboards, the first track Hells Bells will send you to heaven.\r\n...
