This is THE Iron Maiden album for me \r\nsometimes, and sometimes it's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, depends on my mood. \r\nBasically this is where everything came into place and Maiden could do no wrong. Not one \r\nsong is a downer. The album mostly has this Egyptian feel to it, obvious due to the cover...<p>The opener Aces High starts with a bang, and this song is where Bruce Dickinson got his 'air \r\nsiren' name from, most likely from the final notes of the chorus. This song is fast, full of \r\nintricate guitar work and solos, tight drums and bass, and mega intense vocal delivery.<p>2 Minutes to Midnight keeps the album going with it's instantly recognizable main riff \r\n(Maiden has tons of these) and great chorus.<p>Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) is the band's best instrumental track. This is where the Egyptian \r\nthemes really start coming into play. This song is powerful and intense and excellent guitar \r\nwork.<p>Flash of the Blade and The Duelists once again keep the album moving, for there's really no \r\nbreak in the album till towards the end. FotB has nice chorus melodies, especially in the \r\nvocals. The Duelists sees the band playing with different time signatures and more complex \r\nrythyms. Excellent songs.<p>The last 'normal song' (in terms of Maiden's standards) is Back in the Village, probably the \r\nmost fun song with the most ridiculous guitar riff on the album. It's so fast yet so incredibly \r\ncatchy. This song is competition for fastest Maiden song on the album with Aces High.<p>Once the song is over, the prog-metal begins. After a very haunting and evil Pharoah \r\nlaugh, a drum roll leads right into the title track...<p>POWERSLAVE. One of the heaviest songs the band has made, the Egyptian theme is now \r\nin full swing and it couldnt be more amazing. This is the band's most evil, haunting, yet \r\nbeautiful song the band has made. After the main theme of the song ends, it moves to a \r\nmore melodic, sad part of the song. The song builds up with an excellent solo before \r\nbuilding up the song into another solo, but with more power and musicianship. After the \r\nsolo is probably the MOST underrated twin guitar part Maiden ever wrote. Maybe it's cause \r\nthe bass is more prominant in that part, but it is so beautiful, i wish it were more clear.<p>Finally we move to the epic 14 minute track, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The song \r\ntakes its time throughout the song. The first section telling the story. When the song \r\nmoves into 6/8, the song starts becoming more than just your average Maiden tune. Once \r\nBruce is done singing for a bit, the song becomes this dark force that no one could \r\nanticipate, nor contend against. When the mood eventually calms down a bit, the song \r\ngets darker until you can't even see your hands in front of your face. But there is a beakon \r\nof hope, as the song turns more and more uplifting and builds and builds and builds and \r\nbuilds until it cannot build no more and EXPLODES into prog-metal euphoria. My sweet \r\nJesus i have goosebumps, chills down my back and wet pants all at once when the solo \r\ncomes in. Word cannot describe how amazinf this song is, you just have to listen to it \r\nyourself. It just makes you want to go \"Yes!\" and raise your fist. I dont care if you like \r\nprog-metal or not, if you dont enjoy this song, then you are not a prog fan in general in my \r\neyes.<p>I have no more to say...</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93116#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93116\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93116\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93116)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n2.5 stars really!!<p>When one talks to a Maiden fanboys, Powerhouse comes usually in their top three and if you talk to progmetalheads, it usually always ends up on their podium as well.  So we are ready for yet another formulaic metal full-frontal attack. Actually what the artwork tells us is that their mascot Eddy (mentally interned on the last album) is either completely bonkers (imagining himself as a Pharaonic mummy) or the group's concept is now dry and therefore ready for new temporal adventures out of lack of new Invention avenues. Clearly for me, the second option is the one I chose: there is a strong taste of staleness installing itself in Maiden album with this album, but it did not come as a sudden event, it is a gradual and almost imperceptible downslide to repetititititive riff-erama's galore. <p>The usually short hits (but not so short this time) Two Minutes To Midnight and Aces High, the two mid-length so-called epics (Duellists and the title track), a few fillers (Losfer and Blade).. Everything points to yet another chapter of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu/entendu, if it was not for the closing monster track: the 13 min+ Ancient Mariner.  Not that this track is breaking uncharted Nubian desert (which for an ancient mariner would be rather annoying ;-), but it does bring a little \"je ne sais quoi\" that does perk the ear of this old dog. Although of a relatively basic complexity, we have here a real piece of metallic gleam of hope, a bit of an epic; one of these tracks that obviously helped progmetal's development along with Queensryche or mid-period Metallica. And the start of many more migraines for those having metalhead brothers.<p>Definitely not enough to bring the album to an essential status, not even really saving the album from sinking slowly into oblivion (lost in a metallic ocean of now-average and rather boring riffs, overflowed a tidal wave of such albums), this last track is worth a notice, but little more. Do I read/sound over-articulate and non-sensical for such an album? Most likely a reaction to the album which is more than likely contagious in redundancy. Definitely a bit stale, but ultra fans will love, and I actually very happy for them. To each his own. Now about that Univers zero album..\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93156#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93156\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93156\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 3, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93156)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=2647\"><strong>Bj-1</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=2647\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/2647/smmw4.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"Powerslave\" was perhaps the first Iron Maiden album to really contain progressive \r\nelements, something that would become more and more notable over the next few albums. \r\nOf course, the progressive elements are mostly only notable on the last two tracks; the \r\ntitle track and \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" which also both stands out as some my \r\npersonal favorite Maiden tracks. This album is perhaps their heaviest, but still holds a close \r\nhand to their ordinary, less-heavier sound. After several listenings, this turned out to be \r\nmy favorite Maiden release ever.<p>This was Drummer Nicko McBrain's second album with Maiden (he replaced Clive Burr for \r\nthe \"Piece of Mind\" album) and you can hear he has found his place in the band here, with \r\nhis powerful and great drumming style. The guitar riffs are among Maiden's best ever; well-\r\ncomposed yet aggressive in a way without ex-aggerating in any sense. A couple of singles \r\nwas made from this album as well promoting this album even further among it's already \r\nhuge sales. \"Powerslave\" soon became one of the landmarks in the heavy metal scene, \r\nand it still is. Every track is a winner here, something that is very rare for most albums, and \r\nI would say in overall that this is Iron Maiden's best release this far.<p>I highly recommend this album to any fans of this band. This may be not essential in a \r\nregular prog collection, but it's definitely essential in a heavy metal collection. I really can't \r\ngo under 5 stars with this one, although it only merits a 2.5 on a prog scale, It's perhaps \r\ntheir most perfect this far, In my opinion.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93198#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93198\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93198\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 3, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93198)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"Powerslave\" is a straightforward heavy metal album of the mid 80's. The drums and the \r\nbass sound a bit like on \"Piece of mind\", but the electric guitars are slightly more fuzzy and \r\nless incisive. I find all the tracks sound about the same, so that this is a very disciplined and \r\nconservative album. The tracks are slightly progressive, and Dickinson's voice is good \r\nalthough he adopts a repetitive complaining & angry tone, maybe a bit more than usual. To \r\nbe honest, \"Powerslave\" is not an exciting album: maybe it is because the guitar sound & \r\neffects and the drum patterns could be more varied. Harris' bass contrasts with the \r\nmonochrome rhythmic guitar riffs: unfortunately, those monolithic guitar riffs often create \r\nlike a wall to the very elaborated bass, so that the bass seems trapped inside this sound. \r\nOne can notice Harris' omnipresent typical spring-like noise produced on his bass strings. \r\nThe best bit is the mellow one on the \"Powerslave\" track: a very pleasant combination of \r\nmelodic guitar solo and catchy bass; unfortunately, it does not last long enough. The last \r\ntrack, \"Rime of the ancient mariner\", is a progressive metal epic song lasting 13 minutes: it \r\nis the best one on this record, being very catchy and addictive; it has a mellow bit with a \r\ngood frightening atmosphere and a morbid narration: it is very appreciated since it \r\ntemporarily interrupts the monolithic rhythmic guitar riffs. This album is very appreciated \r\namong the metal community.<p>Rating: 4.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93549#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93549\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93549\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 5, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93549)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1923\"><strong>MikeEnRegalia</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1923\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1923/MikeEnRegalia-square.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn my opinion this is Iron Maiden's most progressive album of the 80s, or possibly\r\ntheir best \"prog candidate\" ever. Seventh Son, Brave New World, A Matter of Live and\r\nDeath ... they may contain more easily recognizable prog metal trademarks, but on\r\nPowerslave you get really many somewhat progressive songs together on one album ...\r\nand the other more \"usual\" songs are unusually quirky and innovative - and I think\r\nthey show that the band had managed to find their own style (Out of the ashes of the\r\nNWOBHM, so to speak). Of course it's not a prog metal album - I'd say that it barely\r\nqualifies as prog related. But then again that doesn't mean that it's inferior in any\r\nway - In fact it's one of my favorite metal albums of all time, and essential for any\r\nprog metal fan who's at all interested in the roots of the genre.<p>Here are my comments on the most interesting tracks (from a prog standpoint):<p><strong>Losfer Words</strong>: An interesting instrumental track that I love to play on the\r\nguitar ... a nice, melodic track which is progressive alone because it disrupts the\r\nalbum's \"non-prog\" flow started by the two preceding tracks. Also it's a very good\r\nexample of Iron Maiden's capability to write songs that feature polyphonic parts for\r\nbass, rhythm guitar and lead guitar - quite intriguing.<p><strong>The Duellists</strong>: An epic structure - although the song is only about 6 minutes\r\nlong, it develops nicely and showcases an element which Iron Maiden used extensively\r\nand which was unusual for NWOBHM bands: Altering power chords by moving the base note\r\none half note lower, creating a \"reversed\" major chord on the 5th step (e.g. A5 (A+E) -> Emaj (G#+E)). It's\r\ndifficult to describe - but it's something which really expanded the \"vocabulary\" of\r\nmetal, at least when used that extensively and consistently as Maiden do.<p><strong>Powerslave</strong>: Oriental influences often lend a progressive touch to any style of\r\nmusic - it works for metal as well as for pop (George Harrison/sitar, anyone?). This\r\nis Iron Maiden's oriental epic ... one cannot help compare it to Metallica's Creeping\r\nDeath. While I'd say that Creeping Death is more progressive, this one is more\r\nmelodic and a perfect example for a heavy song with a melodic/acoustic interlude.\r\nThat is followed by a fairly straight solo spot, which is in turn followed by a\r\ndensely layered melody ... then another solo spot, a lengthy drum fill with a clever\r\nchord \"descent\" which takes us back to the song again. Why am I describing it in that\r\nmuch detail? Well, to show that although this is not considered to be prog metal,\r\nit's still a few magnitudes more complex than your average metal song.<p><strong>Rime of the Ancient Mariner</strong>: Clocking in at over 13 minutes, this is as close\r\nto a prog epic as it gets for Iron Maiden. The track has an interesting, literature\r\nbased lyrical concept, and is divided into three parts: The \"main part\" (about the\r\nvoyage of a ship which becomes cursed when one of the mariners kills an albatros), a\r\nnarrational part in the middle and a lengthy outro which picks up many motives from the main part and describes how the curse was lifted, and what happened after the voyage (thoughts of\r\nthe one mariner who survived the voyage). Well, musically it's not that progressive\r\n(except for the part before the narration begins) ... but it's one of my favorite\r\nMaiden tracks, and I love every minute of it. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93865#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93865\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93865\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 9, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93865)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThese guys were the first band to play in an Eastern bloc country with full arena \r\nproduction.They also broke the record for most sellouts at the Longbeach venue in \r\nCalifornia on this tour. Bet you guys didn't know prog was this popular did you ? Haha.This \r\nrecord along with \"Number Of The Beast\" are the two most popular IRON MAIDEN releases \r\namong non-prog fans. For me it's this one and \"Piece Of Mind\". The twin lead guitar attack of \r\nMurray and Smith and the incredible vocals of Bruce (the human siren), and the world class \r\nbass playing of Harris has made these guys a force all over the earth. Steve Harris wrote 4 of the \r\n8 tracks. <p>The first two songs were \r\nactually released as singles.\"Aces High\" is about WWII fighter pilots and the imagery is just fantastic ! \"Two Minutes To Midnight\" is about the threat of nucleur war.The only instrumental \"Losfer Words\" is so intense. The rhythm here is punishing to say the least as the guitars play over top.This is a top three song on this record.The next four \r\nsongs are great and all are part of the Egyptian theme of this album. \"Flash Of The Blade\" opens with such a good guitar melody and it comes and goes throughout. The song turns heavy when the vocals come in. Just a great sounding tune. \"The Duellists\" has a killer rhythm with huge bass lines from Harris. Check out the guitar 3 minutes in and a minute later.<p> \"Back To The Village\" has some amazing guitar to open then that killer rhythm section takes over with vocals. Outstanding sound 3 minutes in. \"Powerslave\" has a haunting intro and when it kicks into gear it doesn't get much better than this. Bruce spits out the words. A calm after 2 1/2 minutes as this absolutely gorgeous guitar comes in followed by a ripping assault. Just an incredible instrumental section here. It turns heavy 5 minutes in with vocals to end it. The best song in my opinion is the \r\nepic \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\". A very progressive and long song at 13 1/2 minutes. Again the rhythm is killer as vocals join in. A calm 5 minutes in and you can hear that the ship and crew are adrift at sea. The spoken words and sound affects are an excellent touch. At 9 minutes in they sound like SABBATH circa \"Master Of Reality\". Then we get that galloping rhythm after 11 minutes.<p>\r\nThe louder this record is played the \r\nbetter it sounds ! Up the irons !</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=95152#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=95152\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=95152\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 19, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #95152)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11104\"><strong>1800iareyay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden is one of my top five favoirte bands in history. Having said that, I do not \r\nbelieve they belong on this site, despite the high level of musicianship from each player. \r\nHowever, since they're here, I might as well review them. Powerslave is usually \r\nconsider to be the band's finest hour and I must agree. I've heard some reviewers on \r\nthis site claim it isn't exciting, but Maiden albums rarely are, the galloping rythmns \r\nmerely fool you into thinking ithe albums are fast paced (the first two albums are but \r\nnot so much on later records). Instead, you get a melodic power metal masterpiece \r\nwith the crazy Nicko McBrain and the bass god Steve Harris anchoring the squeals of \r\nAdrian Smith's and Dave Murray's guitars, plus the soaring vocals of Bruce Dickinson. \r\nHarris is an undisputable bass god and likely second in metal bassists only to Sabbath's \r\nGeezer Butler. His playing on this album is his best, so get ready. <p>The album opens with the ode to World War I pilots \"Aces High.\" This is a rather fast \r\nsong with Harris' bass leading the way and Bruce's voice is superb.<p>\"2 Minutes to Midnight\" is one of the most serious songs Harris ever penned. It deals \r\nwith the threat of nuclear holocaust as a result of the arms race in the Cold War. \r\nMurray's and Smith's solos are some of their finest. <p>\"Losfer Words\" is the band's finest instrumental offering, though don't expect any YYZ. \r\nThe interplay between the guitarists and Harris reveals what talented musicians these \r\nguys are.<p>\"Flash of the Blade\" returns the band to the Rainbow inspired fantasy lyrics that made \r\nthem the power metal stars they are today. It's a bit dull compared to the triple punch \r\nof the album's first few tracks. <p>\"Duellists\" is a splendid piece with Bruce's amazing vocals. The song structure is \r\nsomewhat prog and manages to vary while keeping its chugging pace.<p>\"Back in the Village\" is my least favorite song on the album, though it's far from \r\natrocious. The lyrics are a bit too close to Flash of Blade in my opinion, but then all \r\nfantasy lyrics tend to blur at some point.<p>\"Powerslave\" contains Adrian Smith's greatest solo and Steve's best bass workout, in \r\nmy opinion. The song grinds it way through a mid to slow tempo riff that fades into a \r\nbeautiful solo from Smith. Steve doesn't gallop like he usually does; his sound is slower \r\nand fuller than on many other tracks in the Maiden catalogue. Bruce's vocals are as \r\nusual strong and the lyrics, though silly, are interesting.<p>\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" is one of the band's crowning achievements (likely second \r\nonly to Hallowed Be Thy Name). Concerning the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem of the \r\nsame name, the song twists and turns through the mariner's fateful voyage. One of \r\nBruce's finest performances and enough breaks and time changes to warrant a look \r\neven from prog folkies (no offense Hugues:). It stands as Maiden's longest track to \r\ndate and one of their most progressive.<p>Powerslave is certainly a must have for metalheads, though proggies could avoid it \r\neasily. However, if you like your prog with an edge of heaviness (prog metal, 70s King \r\nCrimson, Fragile era Yes), then this would probably be a welcome addition to your \r\ncollection. I can't give it fives stars on a prog site, but it is certainly an excellent \r\naddition to any audiophile's collection.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=102200#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=102200\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=102200\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, December 8, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #102200)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n3.5 Stars<p>This album avoids the main problem of \"Piece of Mind\". The music here sounds a bit\r\nmore original and the songs are a bit more different from each other. Most of the\r\nsongs are strong and tight, with the 2 longer ones showing the future direction of\r\nthe band. The progression the band went thru in this album is literally 'prog'. Here,\r\nthe band started writing more complex songs, exploring ambient atmospheres, and\r\nincorporating egyptian scales in a couple of songs. Powerslave features Iron Maiden's\r\nlongest song, being 13 minutes long. For me, it is the weakest track on the album, as\r\nit drags in moments and has some really unoriginal riffs.<p>Just like Piece of Mind, the album begins with a catchy metal song of high caliber.\r\n<strong> Aces High </strong> has terrific guitar playing and excellent refrains. <strong> 2 Minutes\r\nto Midnight </strong> is another accessible metal song with melody and power. It has an\r\ninteresting tempo change where the slower section offers wonderful guitar playing.\r\n<strong> Losfer Words </strong> is an instrumental with good ideas scattered, as well as\r\nvirtuosity. <strong> Flash of the Blade </strong> has an original idea for a riff, nice\r\nharmonized choruses, and a creative moment with many guitars playing at the same\r\ntime. <strong> The Duellists </strong> is a more sophisticated song with excellent guitar\r\nperformances and a longish instrumental section with plenty of good musicianship\r\nincluding the bass playing. One of my favourites of the album. <strong> Back in the\r\nVillage </strong> is a straightforward fast-paced metal song, but it has good guitar\r\nriffs, saving it from mediocricy. <p>Now, to the more progressive part of the album:<p><strong> Powerslave </strong> is my favourite song of the album. It has a very captivating main\r\nriff played on the verses which uses egyptian scales and excellent vocal melodies.\r\nThe bridges feature nice melodies and the choruses combines a great vocal hook (as\r\nwell as vocal harmonies) and another great guitar riff using low notes. After two\r\nchoruses, a highly melodic (yes, I'm overusing the word melody) guitar solo sets the\r\nstart of a long instrumental section with the band playing at its best. The bending\r\ndown of a chord sets the song back again to the verses and choruses and the song\r\nfinishes.<p><strong> Rime of the Ancient Mariner </strong> does not grab me as much as it does to other\r\nfans of the band. However, it really has some high points. I just don't like that\r\nmuch the main riff played in the beginning: it's too basic and unoriginal. Luckily, a\r\ntempo change at minute three makes way for a new guitar riff that is more interesting\r\nand a more enjoyable rhythm. An unusual guitar line in a different scale leads way to\r\nan overlong ambient section with narration. Nothing really happens during it, just an\r\nacoustic guitar and an electric one playing the same thing over and over again,\r\nmaking it as boring as the first 3 minutes. Luckily, a more interesting and slightly\r\nheavier section wakes me up. Pay attention for the scream in this part, it is even\r\nbetter than the one in \"Number of the Beast\". Afterwards, some guitar solos appear\r\nand the boring riff of the beginning comes back and finishes the song and album on a\r\nlow point.  This song reminds me of the beginnings of the Death Metal band Opeth.<p>Overall, a very solid album with one huge blunder: Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which\r\nsounds like an amateur attempt to write an epic, failing miserable. The rest ranges\r\nfrom good to excellent and provides more complexity than the previous two albums.<p>\r\n </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104620#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104620\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=104620\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 26, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #104620)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI'll have to skip reviewing PIECE OF MIND for now, as I haven't heard the record, yet \r\n(it's on its way). So, in my current series of all of the Iron Maiden's albums that I have, \r\nlet's continue with the one that many fans (if not me) consider their masterpiece: \r\nPOWERSLAVE. <p>After Clive Burr had to leave Iron Maiden and was replaced by Nicko McBrain, the \r\nband's ideal line-up was finally complete. Even though Burr was a good drummer, his \r\nlevel of playing wasn't up to par with the energetic, stimulant, perfect-for-Maiden style \r\nthat McBrain brought with him to the Beast. His trademark use of the ride cymbal, while \r\nreally very, very simple, is so unique, and fits Maiden's music so much like a perfect \r\nglove, that now I couldn't imagine the group without their always joyful heavy-hitter. \r\nMcBrain plays the drums with such a happy, excited face that it even helps the band \r\nvisual effect (as if it needed any help, with all the Eddy paraphernalia that they got \r\ngoing in their concerts). <p> Besides the change in drumming (change that really occurred in the preceding album, \r\nbut as I haven't heard it yet, I have to make my comments here) Maiden's music also \r\nexperienced an upgrade. Their exploration of more progressive ideas (Maiden's \r\nmembers have never been shy to recognize their progressive influences) and the \r\nimprovement in their guitar textures marks a huge departure from traditional Heavy \r\nMetal acts. It goes without saying that Harris' bass is another big factor in making \r\nMaiden what it is, and it also received a push in quality in POWERSLAVE. Dickinson's \r\nvocals are, as always, powerful and the perfect match for the music. The punk in their \r\nsound was almost completely gone by this point, and the production values were much \r\nhigher, thus helping the band to achieve the status it eventually did (in my eyes) in \r\nSOMEWHERE IN TIME. <p> My only complaints with this album: it lacks the classical melodic, epic song of other \r\nrecords (even THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST had \"Hallowed be thy Name\"), that kind of \r\nsong that only Maiden can deliver, that goes from slow to fast so well-done that the \r\nchange is absolutely smooth, perfect. The emphasis here is on fast tracks, and even \r\nthe epic (by it's length), \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", has not enough melody to \r\nquench this prog-fan's thirst. <p> Aces High (9.5/10) If there's something that nobody knows how to do like Iron Maiden \r\nis how to open their albums. POWERSLAVE gets started with one of the best fast tracks \r\nby the Beast. The simple riff is enhanced by the powerful, throttling bass. The energy \r\nis beyond reach, this really sounds like music for war-airplanes. The solo by Smith and \r\nMurray is fantastic as always, both of them dialoguing, having a \"guitaristic\" \r\nconversation that even we non-guitar-language speakers can understand. The song \r\nreaches its end and we now we're in for one infernal ride. Excellent. <p> 2 Minutes to Midnight (8.5/10) Some distant guitar riff opens this very popular track. \r\nThe song has power and also a sort of punk-ish air to it, but the great vocal delivery by \r\nDickinson makes it a hit. He makes this song a success, besides, of course, the \r\nrelentless bass of Harris, who seems to have fingers full of muscles but also full of \r\nideas. The China-cymbal bit in the instrumental section by McBrain is quite precise.  <p> Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) (8/10) I'm not a huge fan of this piece. It's a good \r\ninstrumental, but as instrumentals go, I prefer more soloing, more melody, and this \r\ntracks feels more like a regular song without lyrics than a true instrumental wrote as an \r\ninstrumental. Of course, the level of playing is very high, specially by Harris who \r\nmanages to make even the most mundane of ideas into something exciting. The guitar \r\nsolo in the middle section ultimately catapults this track to a higher echelon. Good. <p> Flash of the Blade (8.5/10) We're back home with a fantastic riff to open this non-stop \r\nattack on our energy supplies. The verse is not that memorable but the chorus makes \r\nup for it with a catchy melody, ready for arenas. Good song, made even better by \r\nMurray's and Smith's solos. The section where only the two of them dialogue is a \r\ntextbook in good double-guitar metal.   <p> The Duelists (7/10) This one starts with a typical rhythm for Maiden, very similar to \r\nthat of the last song of this album. I don't particularly love this track, but the guitar solo \r\nsection enhances it greatly. Too repetitive, this track may be the weakest in the album. <p> Back in the Village (7/10) The opening riff is decent but not overly original. Pure \r\nenergy, pure speed, a little of punk forces strike back. Harris' bass just keep on coming \r\nwith pounding strength. The other not-memorable track in the album, it doesn't hurt it \r\nas it's perfectly placed right before better songs. <p> Powerslave (8/10) The Egyptian-eastern-sounding riff gives this track a distinct flavor \r\nthat matches perfectly with the lyrics (and overall concept of the album.) This song has \r\na little more in the way of melody, and McBrain's drumming is exactly like it should be. \r\nThe second section (after the main riff) is menacing, almost black-metal menacing. Then \r\nwe have an instrumental section with more melody and a great work by Harris. (his \r\nbass is just so over the place in the mix). A good track that could've been better. <p> Rime of the Ancient Mariner (9/10) The long epic of the album, it tells a great story \r\nwith great resources. At times it could get a little repetitive but there are other \r\nmoments when it really sounds progressive, with great texturing work by the guitars \r\nand master Harris. Dickinson sings his lungs out, but also delivers subtlety and passion. \r\nWith more variation it could've been the first 10/10 I would've given to an Iron Maiden \r\nsong, but I'd have to wait for that. More melody, more diversity and this would have \r\nbeen one of THE epics by The Beast. It's probably their longest song, right above \"The \r\nSign of The Cross\" in THE X-FACTOR, but, unlike that magnificent song, many of the \r\nminutes are just too much alike. Great song. Not perfect. The middle instrumental \r\nsection is amazing, though. It's what <strong>surrounds it</strong> that lacks enough variation. <p> Just by seeing the ratings I've given to the songs it's easy for me to say that I like this \r\nalbum more than THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST. As music goes, it's better, with better \r\nplaying, better ideas, more progressive. That will make me give POWERSLAVE a 4 out \r\nof 5. Curiously, though, melody was more present in the 1982 historical album I just \r\nmentioned. The right balance would be achieved later. <p> Recommended for: Any metal fan; Fans of iron Maiden; fans of fast, energetic songs; \r\nfans of great lightning-fast guitar soloing. <p> Not recommended for: People who dislike metal, Maiden and all of that. You know..<p>.by now it should be clear who should stay away from Iron Maiden. Their music will \r\nchange, but not as much as to create lovers in those who already can't take metal or \r\nthe sounds of The Beast. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126351#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126351\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=126351\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 19, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #126351)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12519\"><strong>SoundsofSeasons</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12519\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12519/muppet_animal.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n2.5 stars, actually<p>I am not an Iron Maiden fan, but from what ive given the chance to hear according to the ratings on this site, i can see why so many \r\npeople are. This album, i believe, is not as \r\ngood as Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, because it does not keep a consistent theme the whole album. However it does give you \r\nsome great songs. The problem i have is that there is some serious filler here, a couple of the songs in the middle are terrible, and it \r\npained me to listen to them all the way through. This is a rather high quality\r\nmetal album, but that being said its still really straight forward and not for a prog fan. If your a metal fan than go ahead and \r\nget it. For the prog fan, Rime of the Ancient Mariner is going to be your only real prog here. <p>Fantastic metal, RotAM is the only prog though, so 2 and a half stars is quite generous.<p><p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=130788#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=130788\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=130788\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 30, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #130788)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nDespite being filled with enough cheese to fill the pyramid on the album's cover, \"Powerslave\" is a juggernaut of infectious and bombastic \r\nmetal, containing some now classic Maiden tracks as well as there most ambitious composition up to this point.  \"2 Minutes\" might just \r\nbe the most fun Iron Maiden chorus of all time, while \"Powerslave\" and \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" show the band experimenting \r\nwith their trademark sound to create some powerful new themes.

With all members now having a minimum of one album and one tour under the belt, the band\r\nis very tight sounding. In addition they are more aware of what they want their music to sound like when recording in the\r\nstudio, and main songwriter Steve Harris still has the ability to conjure up tracks containing slightly surprising creative\r\nelements.<p>Musically Iron Maiden now has developed a distinct style of their own. Small remnants of their early punk roots still remain,\r\nthe heritage from 70's hard rock can still be heard in places; especially on a track like \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", but most\r\ntimes Iron Maiden now has a distinct, unique sound on this album.\r\nFast paced riffing combined with slower, atmospheric riffs, harmonic riffs and extensive use of harmonic, melodic soloing are\r\nall trademarks of Iron Maidens sound here, as well as drums and bass at times played faster than the guitars; and the bass\r\nguitar being a central instrument in the soundscape of most songs.\r\nIn addition to that, the song structures now begin showing influences from prog rock. The long epic \"Rime of the Ancient\r\nMariner\" is the prime example of that, but also a track like \"Losfer Words\"; where the band plays around with repeating\r\nthemes and slight touches of dissonance; is a good example of that influence.\r\nThe musical style is still heavy metal though; as the influence from progressive rock shows more in structure than in style.<p>The songs on \"Powerslave\" are mostly good. Title track \"Powerslave\" and the long epic \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" dominates\r\nthe album, but most of the other tracks here are of high quality as well.<p>Overall this results in a classic heavy metal album; and is a worthwhile addition to most music collections.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=136025#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=136025\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=136025\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 3, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #136025)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe previous Maiden album, \"Piece of Mind\" was a bit of a deception. The ultra fast rhythms were gone and place was left for \r\nheavier and slower-paced music.<p>Fortunately, \"Powerslave\" will be different. Great beats again with a wild opener : \"Aces High\". But the whole of this album is a fully \r\nloaded with the highest energy. I particularly like \"Two  Minutes to Midnight\" and its great guitar break. <p>This guitar orgy goes on and on, tirelessly. \"Flash On The Blade\" and its almost punkish mood is just another song which is \r\naccelerated to the max. Powerful and effective. Even if all these numbers aren't masterpieces, they are a pleasant \r\nmetal \"symphony\".<p>Because in terms of prog, I'm afraid that the average progheads won't be very pleased with a work like this. Several songs are \r\nlonger than average, but this won't mean complex song construction. Just extended simple (but good) tracks. For guitar and metallic \r\nsounds lovers. In this respect, \"The Duellists\" is one of the best and most achieved song. One of the highlights.<p>The title track is also a more elaborate one. Pleasant and melodic middle section (guitar oriented, would you believe). This will only be \r\na short breathe of a smoother moment but the listener is quickly reverted into the fury. A highlight as well.<p>And finally, \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" as the closing number. Their first true epic. From heavy metal to some spacey and ambient \r\nparts for about two minutes (the very first ones in their career so far). But I can't really consider this as the archetype of a prog \r\nsong. It is a creative metal one, that's for sure.<p>I guess that it has been a deep inspiration for some long \"Dream Theater\" pieces. Very strong bass and a bombastic wall of sound \r\neven if it starts as a \"Sabbath\" song. The best song of this very good album.<p>Seven out of ten? Not yet possible, man!

I called the radio station asking who played that excellent tune. The\r\nbroadcaster told me \"It's Iron Maiden . 'Flight of Icarus' from 'Piece of Mind' album\". Oh man, the day after I chased the CD\r\nand I got it! Since then I was hooked to IrMa. Well, I think they are one of the best heavy metal bands in the world. <p>Well, heavy metal is heavy metal .. but . Iron Maiden is unique in sound especially the groove, the guitar solo and most\r\nimportantly .. the bass playing style by Steve Harris which I think contributes a lot `to the total sound of the band,\r\nespecially in creating differentiated groove. Bruce Dickinson voice is also nice but is not something peculiar from the music\r\nof IrMa as there are other lead singers better than him in heavy metal scene like Ronnie James Dio, David Byron (Uriah Heep)\r\nor Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin).<p>'Powerslave' is significantly different from 'Piece Of Mind', in terms of production even though both are equally heavy in\r\nrhythm and riffs. This album was critical milestone to the band's carer in metal world with such legendary tracks like 'Aces\r\nHigh', 'Two Minutes To Midnight', 'Rime of The Ancient Mariner', and the title track.  As I have grown up with mainly\r\nprogressive music augmented with some classic rock and heavy metal, I tend to put my attention more on the epic 'Rime Of The\r\nAncient Mariner\" which consumes the longest duration. There parts with repetition that sometimes make me a bit boring but I\r\nreally love the drive and energy this track delivers. I can relate those of you who like the 70s music might want to compare\r\nthis with Led Zeppelin's \"In My Time of Dying\" where the two have similar style and consume more than 10 minutes in track\r\nduration. Of course, I prefer \"In My Time of Dying\" but I can see that \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\" is an excellent track\r\nthat IrMa must have been so proud about it.<p>Nothing is truly prog with this album and this is a very good album for those of you like heavy metal music. The artwork of\r\nthis album had been very popular in mid 80s, used by the young.

This is, so far, the second best Maiden album from the studio, and Dickinson's finest \r\nhour with the band. He even wrote the title track! Go figure. But, most importantly, his vocals finally \r\nsound perfectly at home with the material. Huh? Oh yeah, and the riffs are brutal and the melodies are \r\nmemorable and all that stuff no one cares about again. <p>The album is apparently a concept album devoted to really awesome slaves; \"power slaves,\" if you will. \r\nI guess. <p>Point is, \"Aces High\" rocks my socks from here to Nebraska. Oh, wait, hmm, does opening the album \r\nwith a song about fighter pilots sound familiar, Piece of Mind's \"Where Eagles Dare?\" Why yes it does. \r\nHowever, \"Aces\" has awesome riffage, and the energy is through the roof. Don't need no stale airplane \r\nsound effects to make this number great. <p>\"2 Minutes to Midnight\" is also, amazingly enough, pretty sweet. The lyrics are pure trash, but they're \r\nstill FUN in a goofy sing-along sorta way. Love the chorus; love the solo parts in the middle even more. \r\nSpeaking of instrumentals, \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\" is the last great ole Maiden instrumental. Is it just \r\nanother excuse for high octane eighties metal riffage? Yes. But is it sweet? As hell; this is eighties metal \r\nat its finest. I love the metalized jig part (why does that sound familiar?). <p>We slow down a bit for the next couple of songs, although they're still quite good. \"Flash of the Blade\" \r\nhas a sick as hell opening with a lightning fast Dungeons and Dragons riff. It's pretty solid within and \r\nthroughout, and the baroque-metal break in the middle is genius. And \"The Duelists?\" Well, \"Duelists\" is \r\njust...just a really solid heavy metal number. All about fighting. For pleasure. Yep. It's not fireworks or \r\nanything, but it's not gonna have you hang your head in shame. <p>\"Back in the Village\" is the only number that leaves me cold. I mean, it's toe-tappin' and all, but it's not \r\na very worthy sequel to \"The Prisoner.\" And all that \"Backinthevillage I'm just backinthevillage\" stuff \r\ngets irritating. <p>However, the best has just about been saved for last. The \"Kashmir\"/\"Stargazer\"/\"Gates of Babylon\" \r\nrip-off of a title track, arguably the best song on the record, is a mini-epic in the vein of \"Phantom of \r\nthe Opera;\" a goofy intro followed by a couple of savage riffs played in sequence. Dickinson's operatic \r\npoetry probably could be better, but just pay attention to the soloing, particularly the fast mid-section \r\n(symbolizing the \"passage of time,\" for you Maiden analysis freaks). Ain't that riff God-like? And when \r\nHarris' bass takes over? Awesome. <p>And when \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" starts up, you just know it's gonna be good. That maritime riff \r\nis superfantastic. And it doesn't disappoint. Sort of. Okay, so any Maiden track that's thirteen minutes \r\nlong can't be one-hundred percent gold (it's just more riffs!), and admittedly, the slow part in the center \r\nis probably a bit much. But hey, then again, maybe it needs it as a breakup section (besides, the fast \r\nsection after it is great). Maybe without it, I honestly WOULD get sick of all this endless riffage, like my \r\nmom always told me I would. Maybe not. But still, considering the track, and considering the band, it's \r\nmore than tolerable. The first riff is great, the second is decent, the slow part is...a little too long, the \r\nstiff \"jam\" is cool, and when we return to the first riff? Well, you know I liked that one. <p>Although, oddly enough, I'm sort of disappointed that the translation of the epic poem into epic Maiden \r\nsong is so straightforward; I liked how earlier songs used their original stories as metaphors for crazed \r\nlove (\"Phantom\") or the falsely accused (\"Rue Morgue\"). But, oh well, can't have it all, as \r\nBruce \"Scream For Me Long Beach\" Dickinson tells us. <p>I honestly don't know why I like this album so much. Dickinson is pretty much free to do what he \r\nwants. The subject matter ranges from pharaohs to fencing to fighter pilots. The sound is pretty much \r\nright where it's always been (although, is a little of the first album's crunch back again?). The cover is \r\nthe farthest from the original covers that we've been (I mean, dude, is there ANY black on that thing? \r\nEddie's eyes are friggin' BROWN!). <p>And yet, there's something about this album. Beyond just the riffs being back, it's more than that. \r\nMaybe it's the fact that the Steve's remembered what made the first Maiden album so good; that it was \r\njust some dudes playing their metal. There ain't no sound effects or spoken intros, backwards or \r\notherwise. Well...okay, so there're those two \"epics\" tacked onto the end. They're in the grand old \r\nstyle, damn it! They're actually LESS over-the-top and lumbering than anything \"epic\" on the last \r\ncouple of albums. <p>There's also an...energy on here or something, especially when compared to the last album. It's like \r\nthe band found a sudden burst of \"not suck,\" and used it to their advantage. <p>Or maybe I just really, really like mummies. I dunno. I mean, it's not like the thing is perfect; despite \r\nthere being an instrumental, this is just about as varietous as any Maiden album, and other than rockin' \r\nout, it's hard to, you know, really honestly relate to these guys. But still, no pretentious headbanger \r\nshould be without this one. <p>Anyways, I gotta get back to building this pyramid for the almighty Dickinsonian one. See ya in a \r\nthousand ages or so. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176256#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176256\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=176256\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 7, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #176256)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nPowerslave is Iron Maiden\u00b4s fifth album and the third with Bruce Dickenson behind the microphone. \r\nIron Maiden were at this time already one of the biggest heavy metal bands in the world but with \r\nPowerslave they cemented that position. Powerslave is one of their most classic albums and it contains \r\nmany live favorites. Powerslave is probably my second favorite Iron Maiden album and it\u00b4s only \r\nsuperseeded by Somewhere in Time.  Powerslave was also a significant album for Iron Maiden as it \r\nmarked the first time the band had a steady lineup over two albums. The success and praise which \r\nPowerslave received at the time of it\u00b4s release in 1984 led Iron Maiden towards one of the biggest and \r\nlongest tours of their career. You can hear evidence of that tour on the fantastic Life After Death album.<p>Powerslave begins with one of the most classic Iron Maiden tracks Aces High. Bruce starts the song \r\nwith his signature air siren scream which fits the lyrics about air fighting well. It\u00b4s a very fast paced \r\nsong ( of couse not blast beats tempo but still fast) with some really challenging guitar riffs. A favorite \r\nIron Maiden track for me if there ever was one. Two Minutes To Midnight continues the album in great \r\nstyle. It\u00b4s a mid paced song with some beautiful vocal lines and guitar chord progressions. I\u00b4ve always \r\nbeen touched emotionally by this song. I don\u00b4t know why but it works really well for me.<p>Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) is an instrumental song which has never been my favorite. Of course it\u00b4s Iron \r\nMaiden we\u00b4re talking about so it\u00b4s still great. Flash Of The Blade is also a good song but again not a \r\nfavorite for me. The main guitar riff is a bit generic seen with today\u00b4s eyes, but probably worked \r\nwonders back then. There are some great classical guitar notes being played here too which are really \r\ngreat. The Duellists, which like Flash of the Blade is a song about one of Bruce Dickenson\u00b4s big hobbies \r\nsword fighting ( I\u00b4m sorry but my limited English doesn\u00b4t allow me to give a more sophisticated \r\nexplanation), is also pretty good but again nothing special. Back In The Village is a fast paced song \r\nwhich reminds me a bit about the two previous songs. It\u00b4s good but not an Iron Maiden classic. It\u00b4s \r\nfunny but the four previous songs have never been favorites of mine in Iron Maiden\u00b4s discography \r\neven though they are good songs. They remind me of some of the least exciting songs from Piece of \r\nMind.<p>Powerslave brings us back on the right course again. This is a classic Iron Maiden song. It\u00b4s got a \r\nreally cool main riff with an egyptian mood. It\u00b4s such a great heavy song with great lyrics. One of the \r\nhighlights of the album. Another highlight is definitely the last song on the album which is the epic Rime \r\nOf The Ancient Mariner. This is another classic Iron Maiden song and a fan favorite. The lyrics are \r\ninspired by Samual Taylor Coleridge famous poem written in 1797 - 1799. The song is 13:36 minutes \r\nlong and it\u00b4s one of the longest songs written by Iron Maiden if not the longest. <p>The musicianship is excellent as always with Iron Maiden. It\u00b4s impossible not to be impressed with the \r\ntight interplay between the musicians and of course Steve Harris dominant and busy basslines. Bruce \r\nDickenson is such a unique singer and proves once again why he is so highly regarded by the fans of \r\nIron Maiden.<p>The production from Martin Birch is one of the best productions that Iron Maiden has ever had and it\u00b4s \r\neven more impressive that Powerslave had this sound in 1984. I don\u00b4t recall hearing any other metal \r\nband from 1984 having this good a production. The bass is very high in the mix which of course is an \r\naquired taste but personally I think it sounds great.<p>The cover is one of the most beautiful and detailed covers ever. This one\u00b4s a favorite of mine. Derek \r\nRiggs has really outdone himself with this one ( and would again on Somewhere in Time)<p>Powerslave is one of the most classic heavy metal album of the eighties and one of the most important \r\nalbums in Iron Maiden\u00b4s discography. After my favorite Somewhere in Time I would chose this one as \r\ntheir best. There is only one true masterpiece in Iron Maiden\u00b4s discography though and as Powerslave \r\ndoes have some weak parts I\u00b4ll rate this excellent album 4 stars. It might be the best place to start if \r\nyou\u00b4re curious about Iron Maiden as it represents them so well. This is highly recommendable.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176511#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176511\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=176511\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 11, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #176511)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>Powerslave</em> was my introduction to Iron Maiden and it is a highly recommended album for both\r\nmetal fans and prog heads. It is the crowning achievement of their evolution from punk-metal to\r\nambitious prog metal epics, it has some of their best songs and I've never heard them play tighter\r\nor more passionately.<p>The opener is spot on, <em>Aces High</em> is an excellent 80's take on Rainbow's <em>Kill The King</em>,\r\ninjecting with more aggressive playing and speed. <em>2 Minutes to Midnight</em> is another Maiden\r\nanthem, slightly commercial but too catchy to resist. <em>Losfer Words</em> is the first track on the\r\nalbum that extends their usual epic hard rock formula. It's an instrumental with gorgeous bass work\r\nfrom Harris and a structure that goes a bit further then usual metal formats. It's no <em>YYZ</em> but\r\nsure enjoyable. \r\n<em>Flash of The Blade</em> has some pleasing instrumental sections but suffers from a cheesy bridge\r\nand chorus. Also <em>The Duellists</em> has never appealed much to me, but the remainder of the album\r\nmore then makes up for this mid-album dip.<p>With <em>Back In The Village</em>, the album gets the momentum back from the first three tracks. A\r\nhighly Blackmore influenced guitar riff kicks of this catchy speed metal gem. The title track\r\n<em>Powerslave</em> is my favourite Maiden song and I'm quite sure I'm not the only one. Their best\r\ngalloping riff ever, vicious verses, an ominous Eastern music inspired bridge, great vocal harmonies\r\nin the chorus and an excellent guitar solo. Also the rhythm is a clear nod to Middle-Eastern dance\r\nrhythms and the main reason for the Egyptian flavour. The 13.30 minutes of <em>Rime of the Ancient\r\nMariner</em> can't be missed neither. It's Maiden's most bold and proggy moment and they pull it\r\noff with great flair.<p>Slightly uneven but still superb, <em>Powerslave</em> isn't an album you are allowed to miss if you\r\nare interested in heavy prog, prog metal or power metal. If you think Iron Maiden isn't more then a\r\ndaft commercial 80's metal band, then this album could make you change your mind. An obvious Iron\r\nMaiden favourite. 4.5 prog-related stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260430#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260430\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=260430\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, January 12, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #260430)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12042\"><strong>Finnforest</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12042\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12042/FINNFOREST.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>Steve Harris rocks</B><p>One of the site's more dubious additions were Iron Maiden even though you must remember they occupy\r\nprog-related, not prog-metal.  For some even that placement is going too far.  I remember the day after this\r\ntour hit our city the Powerslave shirts took over the high school halls.  I can't remember why I\r\ndidn't go but I would have enjoyed it.  The album, and actually the band, are a mixed bag for me\r\npersonally.  I hate Bruce Dickinson's frequent upper register warbles with a passion, and my friends\r\nand I always found the Maiden guitar sound to be a bit thin.  Yet what does work here works in a big\r\nway.  Listening to Steve Harris is just mesmerizing to me, he's a monster.  And has anyone noticed\r\nhow the Maiden rhythm section can sound just a bit like Trewavas and Pointer but with a harder,\r\nfaster edge?  The tracks are too repetitious for me to listen to often, yet they excel in their own\r\nway and remain fun to revisit on occasion.  Aces, 2 Minutes, and Back in the Village are loads of\r\nfun with then hooks and punkish energy.  Rime is a bit oversold as the highlight when the title\r\ntrack should be the one getting the attention.  It encapsulates all of the strengths of Maiden (and\r\nPowerslave) in a more succinct package.  From the guitar harmonies to the acoustic interlude to the\r\nmemorable riffs, it has a great ferocity and bite to it.  On the down side the album lags a bit in\r\nthe middle section from Losfer Words through The Duellists. The lyrics of Powerslave also deserve\r\nsome acclaim, being more ambitious and intelligent than those proposed by many of their peers at\r\nthat time.  A good album for the 80s metal fan.  \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=281020#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=281020\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=281020\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, May 8, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #281020)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden - Powerslave (1984)<p>\r\nOn the fifth studio album of Iron Maiden the band slightly recovers from the small loss of \r\nenergy that Piece of Mind (1983) had suffered from. Powerslave is one of the heaviest \r\nalbums of the band with a continues high pace and intensive instrumental parts in all \r\nsongs. The album is a favorite for a lot of fans of the band. <p>The opener Aces High is an up-tempo track with spectacular high pitched vocals of Bruce \r\nDickinson and a great instrumental guitar part. This song is very powerful and I used to like \r\nit very much, but the songs doesn't grow over time. Two Minutes to Midnight is stronger with \r\nsome very inspiring melodic songwriting. The opening riff is quite conventional, but the \r\nbridge has a great dark feel and the couplet has a nice twist that keeps in interesting. The \r\nmelodic soloing in the lower paced middle section is good. Losfer Words is an \r\ninstrumental metal track. It's good, be I prefer the instrumentals of the first two albums. \r\nSomehow the melodies aren't as catchy as on other instrumental parts of Maiden.<p>Flash of the Blade is another up-tempo song with pull-off guitar themes all over the place \r\nthat give it a sophisticated feel. A nice experiment. The Duellists is one of the stronger \r\ntracks of the album. It has many instrumental parts and I really like the vocal parts. It is a \r\nsong with it's own atmosphere that is kind of relaxing. Back in the Village is like Flash of the \r\nBlade a song full of guitar frenzies and little good songwriting. I liked it very much at first, but \r\nI think it's a bit too much of to little. <p>Powerslave, the title-track, is  strong Maiden epic with all elements the band has to offer. \r\nThe song has an Egyptic feel as can be expected with an album cover like this. The many \r\nstrong instrumental parts make this an important Maiden song. The Rime of the Ancient \r\nMariner is the absolute highlight of the album. With it's 13 minutes it still is the longest \r\nMaiden track ever recorded. It has an amazing story, a great atmospheric middle section, \r\nmore great instrumental parts and solo's and a good ending. Perhaps this is the proggiest \r\nof Maiden's epics. <p>Conclusion. Another good Iron Maiden album with some weak spots. I might not have \r\nalways been very positive in my Maiden reviews, but it's important to know I prefer mediocre \r\nMaiden tracks to most other metal tracks of other bands. The standard of Iron Maiden was \r\nquite high and my expectations have risen over the time when I got into progressive music. \r\nThis album is yet another good metal album with lot's of progressive moments and enough \r\ngood songwriting to get four stars. After this Iron Maiden would again change directing with \r\nthe synth-guitar driven Somewhere in Time. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284342#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284342\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284342\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 31, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284342)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>\"Hear the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Stay here and listen to the nightmare of the \r\nsea!\"</strong> <p>\"Powerslave\" is the first great progressive metal Iron Maiden album, after they had released \r\na few albums leading to this new direction in their music. IM were always threatening to \r\nrelease an album like this once they broke away from the confining short songs and 4/4 \r\ntraditional rock signatures. There was always experimentation with time sigs but this was \r\nall taken to the extreme level with the brilliant 13 and a half minute onslaught of 'Rime Of \r\nThe Ancient Mariner'; my all time favourite IM track. <p>I could spend this entire review talking about this track alone, and when I heard this on the \r\nmetal radio show, when this was first released, the announcer stated that this track alone \r\nwas worth getting \"Powerslave\"; I concur with this. It is simply brilliant metal and I have \r\nplayed this so many times I have somehow managed to memorise every lyric and even the \r\nlead breaks. There are some incredible lead breaks here by the duel guitars of Murray and \r\nSmith. The complexity of the music cannot be taken for granted, there are time sig shifts \r\nthroughout and mood swings at every verse. The song begins with a galloping riff with \r\nsmall diversions and then it launches into a fast tempo speed lick. \"The ship sails on \r\nthrough the fog and ice.... Water water everywhere and all the boards did shrink...\" The lyrics \r\nare based on Coleridge's poem of the same name and it this song is a very faithful \r\ninterpretation; the university lecturer played this track when I was studying poetry would you \r\nbelieve. I had given the lyrics and song to the lecturer on her request. It eventually cleared \r\nthe room of all the ladies but I sat there and enjoyed it. <p>The song basically goes into each aspect of the poem, where the Mariner sees an \r\nalbatross, kills it and thus the curse of death plagues the ship killing his crew. \"The Mariner \r\nkills the bird of good omen...\" and the siren like banshees of \"Death and She Life in death \r\nthey throw their dice for the crew\", and they want the Mariner to succumb to their deathly \r\ncharms. Eventually the pace slows and it grinds to a halt with a bassy passage with \r\natmospheric effects, such as a witch's cackle and the creaking of the doomed ship. A \r\nnarrative voice speaks Coleridge's epic poem that Dickinson had previously been \r\nscreaming out with utter conviction. It reminds me now of Van der Graaf Generator's lyrics \r\nby Hammill on 'Plague of Lighthouse Keepers' that is also about a doomed ship and \r\ndrowning. \"They dropped down one by one,\" the narrator speaks and then the pace \r\nquickens again. The theme of dying and being stalked by death itself is powerful. When the \r\nbass begins and a new chugging riff enters, Dickinson's vocals penetrate with power, \"The \r\ncurse it lives on in their eyes, the Mariner he wished he died along with the sea creatures \r\nbut they lived on so did he, then by the light of the moon he prays for their beauty not doom, \r\nwith heart he blesses them God's creatures all of them too, then the spell starts to break, \r\nthe albatross falls from his neck...\" After the curse is lifted, a lengthy brilliant lead break with \r\nfret melting dexterity pummels the senses. It returns back to the intro riff with variations, I \r\nlove the lyrics, \"that we should love all things that God made\" as it shows the Mariner has \r\nlearnt his lesson from killing the albatross and now has converted to admiring creation \r\nrather than destroying it. The poem is also my favourite poem due to this song, and I wrote \r\na very solid essay about it; thank you Iron Maiden for that High Distinction! Overall this track \r\nis quintessential to Maiden and is always the highlight for me when it appears on live \r\nconcert DVDS.<p>\r\nOK, for the rest of the album there is enough here to make this a worthy purchase. 'Aces \r\nHigh' has a catchy chorus and very good guitar work, a classic track. 'Two Minutes To \r\nMidnight' was played on metal radio show just before the witching hour so I have heard it \r\nmany times. It's great in concert and still a popular favourite with Iron fans. 'Powerslave' is \r\na terrific song with killer riffs and a memorable chorus. The Egyptian themes here are of \r\ncourse due to IM's interest in the Egyptian Book of the Dread (shock horror) but the themes \r\nlead to the mighty stage set with the Sphinx and Pyramids, and Tutenkhamen mummified \r\nobjects; it is all very \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" for me, but a cool image in it's day, no doubt. <p>\r\nSo overall here is an album with strong progressive elements, one killer epic to die for, and \r\na lot of catchy shorter songs. It is definitely worth getting hold of, trust me on this. Along \r\nwith \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" and \"Brave New World\" this is an excellent metal feast \r\nof Iron Maiden.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289805#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289805\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=289805\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 9, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #289805)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=30993\"><strong>zravkapt</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=30993\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/30993/42stupidcute.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOne of the great things about PA is that I can review albums that are not strictly prog, but would \r\nbe of interest to proggers(Proto, Related). Of course on a metal site(like Metal Archives which I \r\nhave yet to check out) I would give this album 5 stars. Powerslave is my favourite Maiden \r\nalbum. But this is not their proggiest effort. \"Back In The Village\" is almost filler here. \"2 \r\nMinutes To Midnight\" is a popular song but I never liked it very much. Up to this point in their \r\ncareer Maiden seemed equally influenced by punk and prog, yet remained 100% metal. \r\nBut \"The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" is IMO, one of the first prog-metal songs.<p>\r\nAlmost 14 minutes of some of the greatest music you will hear from the 1980s. \"Mariner\" has \r\ngreat playing, great lyrics, great singing...well it's just great, really. I've always loved the part in \r\nthe middle with the minimalistic bass and atmospheric guitar with Dickinson narrating. Some \r\nof the best guitar solos from this band can be found here. \"Losfer Words\"(get it? Lost For \r\nWords) is a great instrumental. I admit I'm not really familiar with anything the band did after \r\nFear Of The Dark, but going by memory, I think this is the only instrumental Maiden did \r\nbetween 1980-92. \"Aces High\" is a classic metal song but not very proggy. \"Flash Of The \r\nBlade\" and \"The Duellists\" have great choruses but the rest of the two songs aren't quite as \r\ngood.<p>\r\nThe title track is the next proggiest thing to \"Mariner\". It's a great song. The album cover is my \r\nfavourite of all Maiden albums. Anything to do with ancient Egypt is just super cool in my \r\nopinion. I like the fact that you can hear Steve Harris' bass clearly; on most '80s metal albums \r\nthe bass usually gets buried under overdubbed guitars. I think he writes most of Maiden's \r\nlyrics, I'm not sure. But Powerslave has some of the best lyrics Maiden has to offer. This is \r\nnothing essential to a progger but every metalhead should have this album in their collection. \r\n3 stars. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=305554#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=305554\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=305554\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 19, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #305554)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nPart three of the Iron Maiden greatest hits trilogy begins with the beloved concert classic <em>Aces High</em> and continues in a similar fashion with <em>Two Minutes To Midnight</em>. But does it mean that the band has finally managed to win me over with their music? The short answer (and judging from my rating) is yes, but please allow me to explain.<p>\r\nIt's really not the lack of hits that made <em>The Number Of The Beast\r\n</em> and <em>Piece Of Mind</em> such underwhelming releases, instead it's the regular album tracks and the general lack of creative soul searching that made it seem as though Iron Maiden was stamping the same ground and would most likely never get any better than that. Luckily this wasn't so and <em>Powerslave</em> is a perfect example that will hopefully prove all naysayers wrong. If anything, this is probably the band's most consistent release of their entire career with all of these eight tracks featuring the stereotypical Iron Maiden cliches of the past but this time it works because of the longer instrumental passages, better material and a revived interest for progression. The latter might not be too obvious at first but the last two tracks make it a bit more obvious.<p>\r\nThe Ancient Egyptian themed title track and 13+ retelling of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem <em>Rime Of The Ancient Mariner</em> are pretty much as good as this band will ever get for us, casual fans. While the rest of the material might not shine as bright, it still has just enough energy to make it an enjoyable ride leading to the two great compositions towards the end.<p>\r\nIf you've still not heard a single Iron Maiden album then this is definitely a great place to start. The band would get even better with their next release, but I'll skip the details for the time being.<p>***** star songs:  Rime Of The Ancient Mariner (13:36)<p>**** star songs:  Aces High (4:29) Two Minutes To Midnight (6:00) Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) (4:13) Flash Of The Blade (4:02) The Duellists (6:07) Back In The Village (5:20) Powerslave (6:48)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=549303#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=549303\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=549303\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 13, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #549303)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden further refined the style of Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind with Powerslave, \r\nwhich included both breakout hits such as Aces High or 2 Minutes to Midnight and progressive \r\nmetal epics such as the title track and, in particular, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

Apparently this stability meant they could focus on the music and refine it until\r\nit was of near perfection. All members are on full display here at the peak of their careers. All\r\nstars align in this metal masterpiece just like the shadows on the calendar days of ancient Egypt at\r\na time when the pyramids served as an aid to the mysteries of the universe. Eddie seems to be stuck\r\nin the insane asylum still on the last album since he is not on here and only a sarcophagus\r\nrepresentation of his ancient ancestors seems to be on display.<p>POWERSLAVE was an important development in IRON MAIDEN's career as it took all which came to be on\r\nthe previous albums and refined them into amazing creations that had the catchiness, the\r\naggressiveness and the beauty and added more complex progressive elements as clearly shown in the\r\nband's most compex song ever \"The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" which is based on the poem by Samuel\r\nTaylor Coleridge that was written way back in 1798. <p>This is simply one of those beyond belief albums in music history much less metal that demands to be\r\nheard and more than holds up the test of time. The band set off on their longest and most successful\r\nlive tour based on this album which spawned the live album LIVE AFTER DEATH. At this point the band\r\nreached the level of superstardom and would forever be an influence on the musical world. <p>The only curiosity i've ever felt toward this album is that the cover art which is one of my\r\nfavorites in all of music history suggests a concept album based around the medieval past in Egypt\r\nyet begins with a song that is about flying jets. I guess my expectations of a full on concept\r\nalbums are too demanding and I will not impose it on this album because they did not fulfil them.\r\nTaken for what it is it is still a masterpiece of metal music that does not seem in the least bit\r\ndated all these decades later. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1128722#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1128722\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1128722\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, February 8, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1128722)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11816\"><strong>Modrigue</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11816\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11816/PA-Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Half powerful</strong><p>Wow, what a stunning artwork! This must be top-notch middle-eastern heavy metal! Well, unfortunately not exactly....<p>\"Powerslave\" marks, for me, the transition from a pure, epic to a more prog-oriented metal. Thus, as for most transitional albums, it has both good and bad parts.<p>Good parts are tracks 1, 3, 7 and 8. \"Aces High\" is a powerful, typical MAIDEN opening, which shares some similarities with \"Where Eagles Dare\". \"Losfer Words\" is an aggressive instrumental track with interesting variations. However, the record highlight - and the main interest for proggers - are the Egyptian-like title track and the 13 minutes suite \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". These songs alone justifies the listen. Unfortunately, the rest of the album does not present the same quality and originality.<p>The other half of the album contains mostly what I consider as filler songs. \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" sounds rather flat, contrasting with the enthusiasm of the opening track. \"Flash of the Blade\" and \"The Duellists\" have strong intros, but afterwards becomes annoying and repetitive, missing at keeping interest. The worst moment of the album is undoubtedly \"Back In The Village\". This song may be one of their less inspired from the 80's. Compared to the epic tracks on the previous album \"Piece of Mind\", this is quite a contrast.<p>My least favorite 80's IRON MAIDEN album. Prog fans can give it a listen, but for them I'll rather recommend \"Somewhere in Time\", \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\", or even \"The X-Factor\".</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1537151#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1537151\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1537151\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, March 8, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1537151)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=66200\"><strong>Kempokid</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Metal Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=66200\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/66200/d104db329b522027ece019aa5c4d1b00.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden's fifth album is generally considered to be one of their best, and while I disagree with this, finding some of \r\ntheir reunion efforts to surpass this, along with some classic ones, this is still a great album. The energy on this album \r\nmatches that of Number of the Beast, with great musicianship all around. Bruce Dickinson is an incredible singer, \r\nbeing able to combine power with good range and have a dramatic flair to it as well.  <p>\r\nThis album has quite a definitive duality to it, with half the songs being fairly straightforward such as 'Aces High' and \r\nmore involved, complex songs, particularly 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner'. Both types of songs are of high quality, with \r\nthe traditional metal tracks being fun and up tempo, full of great riffs and the amazing basswork of Steve Harris. 'Aces \r\nHigh' is especially great in this regard, being one of the fastest and most energetic songs the band has ever written, \r\nwith an extremely memorable hook to go along with it. On the other side of things, the more involved works manage \r\nto keep many of the traditional heavy metal elements to it, while also having some fairly interesting ideas thrown in as \r\nwell. The title track, while the lyrics are very theatrical, are still interesting and tell a great story within the short song \r\nlength. Along with the lyrical content being interesting, the mild Egyptian touches to the main riff, along with the \r\nincredible guitar solo, make this a very worthy song. 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' is where the album really picks up, \r\nbeing one of the best songs Maiden has ever written, with a great sense of progression to it, becoming more intense \r\nas the song goes on before completely dropping out, leaving nothing but eerie bass and Bruce reading poetry, all \r\nbefore picking up once again, not wasting a single moment within the 13 minutes of the song. <p>\r\nThe album does have an issue with consistency however, as the middle four tracks are considerably weaker than the \r\nrest, especially 'Back In The Village' which while fast and energetic, is fairly uninteresting, with Bruce's vocals sounding \r\nunimpressive during the chorus, and the song being overall very weak. 'Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)' is the other major \r\nweak point, simply because while the riffs are immediately catchy and enjoyable to listen to, the structure of the song \r\nleaves a lot to be desired, with it building up quite well. before just... ending, leading to disappointment. Other than \r\nthese two songs, the album is of high quality, even if 'Flash of the Blade' and 'The Duellists'' aren't anything amazing. \r\n<p>\r\nOverall, this is a great album full of great riffs, great energy, and great songwriting. I believe that despite the weaker \r\nmoments on the album, notably 'Back In The Village', the album is still more than worth listening to. <p>\r\nBest Songs: Aces High. Powerslave, Rime of the Ancient Mariner<p>\r\nWeakest Songs: Losfer Words (Big 'Orra), Back In The Village <p>\r\nVerdict: A great album full of equal parts traditional, straightforward heavy metal, and more unique, experimental \r\nmoments, all culminating in the 13 minute epic. One of the finest moments for Maiden (In which there are a lot) \r\ndespite the occasional missteps.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2112068#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2112068\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2112068\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, December 29, 2018</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2112068)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=72397\"><strong>A Crimson Mellotron</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=72397\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/72397/6a00d83451f25369e20162fbc646af970d.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n'Powerslave' by Iron Maiden is a good example of what a decent 80s metal album sounds like... but not much more. The follow-up to 'Piece of Mind', one of their more successful releases, is a somewhat disappointing venture into common ground, as the British new wave metal legends present a collection of eight songs, recorded at Nassau Point Studio in the Bahamas, that does not necessarily expand their sound. It has to be said that up to that point Iron Maiden had been gaining momentum, with each release reaching a wider audience, performing better commercially, and so on. However, what I think is that out of their first five studio albums, 'Children of the Damned' is the one that deserves the most attention, as the rest seems a bit incomplete still, maybe lacking this crispy cohesiveness that they would later develop, with albums like 'Seventh Son' or 'Brave New World'.<p>As for 'Powerslave', it is a powerful, energetic and uplifting recording, kicking off with two awesome and kickass singles, those being 'Aces High' and '2 Minutes to Midnight'. As usual, the primary writer (or rather, contributor) to the essence of the album, is the band's brilliant bass player Steve Harris, undoubtedly one of the most important and influential bassists of his generation, the rest of the band is performing not worse. Bruce Dickinson also sounds like a beast on this album, and there is a very strong Ian Gillan influence on several moments of his phrasing and screaming throughout the album. 'The Duellists' is an interesting song, the title track is really good, and the 13-minute 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' has to be the big winner of the album, as it can be safely said, Maiden went full on prog with this one! A multi-section epic, with shifting moods and tempos, it is a severely promising composition, and a side of the band's sound that would be best developed on the aforementioned 'Seventh Son'.<p>What I know is that 'Powerslave' is a bit polarizing for fans and critics of the band alike; For me - I know I have heard heaps of better albums, and I am certain that they have released much stronger LPs. Not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination, but not a mind-blowing and game-changing either.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2580890#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2580890\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2580890\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 23, 2021</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2580890)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=69885\"><strong>Hector Enrique</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=69885\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/69885/tool_ojo.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe success and recognition garnered by \"Piece of Mind\" could have been the ultimate aspiration for any band of \r\nthe effervescent eighties heavy metal, but not for Iron Maiden, who were not satisfied with the enormous \r\npopularity generated by their fourth album. Far from pigeonholing themselves in the short structures of machine-\r\ngun guitars and demanding vocal registers typical of the exalted genre, the Englishmen challenge themselves by \r\nincorporating new epic elements that enrich the musical and aesthetic proposal of their next work, \"Powerslave\" \r\n(1984), starting with the iconic cover where a pharaonic and omnipresent Egyptian Eddie dominates the setting and \r\nwhich would lead one to suppose a concept album (but which is not...).<p>\r\n\"Powerslave\" flows with enormous energy and an unusual forcefulness, between the most aggressive \"Maiden\" \r\nsonorities, like the powerful and direct \"Aces High\" and \"Two Minutes to Midnight\", obligatory pieces in the live \r\nperformances of the band, the suffocating urgency of \"Flash of the Blade\"' and the rawness of the early years in \r\n\"Back in the Village\", combined with the more elaborate metal of the instrumental \"Losfer Words (Big \"Orra)\" and \r\n\"The Duellists\", a piece inspired by a knightly fight in the Napoleonic era that was made into a film by Ridley Scott in \r\n1977.<p>\r\nHowever, the album's highlight clearly shines towards its final stretch, with the primal progressive metal emanating \r\nfrom the robust and mythic \"Powerslave\" (the solos and guitar duel between Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are \r\nformidable), and the stellar progressive exploration of the immeasurable \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", a vigorous \r\nsea epic inspired by the 1798 poem of the same name by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and masterfully \r\nsustained by Steve Harris' piercing bass, especially in the gloomy middle section accompanied by the plaintive creak \r\nof a ghostly ship, and topped off by the blast of the galloping guitars of the Murray/Smith duo supporting Bruce \r\nDickinson's excellent vocal performance, in an unbeatable close.<p>\r\n\"Powerslave\" elevated Iron Maiden to worldwide megastar status, leading to the mammoth \"World Slavery Tour\" \r\nbetween August 1984 and July 1985, with almost two hundred shows in Europe, Asia, North America, South America \r\nand Oceania, and over 3.5 million people in attendance.<p>Excellent.<p>4/4.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3123867#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3123867\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3123867\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, December 9, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12931#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3123867)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nDespite a number of albums prior to this that have gained legendary status, 'Powerslave', Iron Maiden's fifth studio \r\nrecording, is where I feel the band really hit their stride as one of metals most iconic  bands.\r\n\r\nWith a previous four releases over which to bond and mature as a band, 'Powerslav\r\n...
