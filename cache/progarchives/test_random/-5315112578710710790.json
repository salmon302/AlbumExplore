The\r\nprevious album was good, but it was the album who started the 'dark neo-progressive' movement a\r\nnumber of years back that has since spread like wildfire across the scene, and though it broke new\r\nground for a subgenre that is known for being redundant, it was still a stereotypical neo-prog album\r\n- wrapped around old school Genesis's waist like a child afraid to move too far away from its\r\nmother. <I>A Harvest Of Souls</I> was the 25-minute megalodon that got so much attention, and was\r\napparently a direct tribute to <I>Supper's Ready</I>, but came off more as an unoriginal rip-off.<p>So to end this introduction to a bad 70s Soap Opera, this time on <B>King By-Tor takes on IQ</B>...<p>Frequency is a stellar album. Lord only knows what happened to the band in the 4 years time since\r\nthe previous album, but they have gotten their act together and created a magical hour and one\r\nminute of music crafted out of the finest of neo-progressive styling and yet still able to tread new\r\nwaters. They've managed to find a happy ground between dark progressive music and a more emotional\r\nand, honestly, more real, less pretentious area of writing. The songs don't come off as forcing\r\nmascara and black nail polish, but instead as genuine reflections of social statements and emotive\r\nanecdotes. They also haven't forced themselves to work in the 'long song' medium, meaning that what\r\nmay come off as a 'rip-off' song to some ears that takes up over half the album doesn't exist (see:\r\n<I>A Harvest Of Souls</I>). The songs manage to go on for just as long as they need to, the\r\nstructure of each actually supporting enough material to go on without becoming redundant or imposed.<p>In fact, each of the songs is its own impressive opus, as though <I>Dark Matter</I> had continued\r\nwith the more mid-lengthed songs, instead of trying for the centerpiece. Among the standouts on the\r\nalbum are the rip-roaring opening title track, <B>Frequency</B> with it's blistering, yet somehow\r\nnot overly-bombastic solos and well thought out time changes, it's dark atmosphere that's still\r\nstrangely inviting - like a magnetic storm that begs to be investigated. More to come with another\r\nside of the band in the second track, <B>Life Support</B>, a fragile opus that opens with a\r\nbeautiful piano and slowly evolves into a tear-jerker of a song that still manages to hold the\r\nalbum's consistency without losing momentum. After the opening two tracks the next song of total\r\nnod-worthy approval has to be one of IQ's greatest achievement to date - <B>Riker Skies</B> steals\r\nthe show on the album, even if it's not the longest or most comparatively complex. Meeting\r\n<I>Ayreon</I> halfway with more dark material from the likes of <I>Dark Matter</I>, this masterwork\r\nof a song is impressive from listen to listen, even for those who may fancy themselves as people who\r\ndon't enjoy the more 'troubadouric' side of progressive music.<p>Throughout the rest of the album there's no low points, all of the other numbers are equally as\r\nimpressive, even if they don't shine quite so brightly as some of the brilliant highlights.\r\n<B>Stronger Than Friction</B> is the first song to pass the 10-minute mark on the album, and it's\r\nquite impressive with its melodic chorus and majestic solos. <B>The Province</B> marks the longest\r\nsong on the album, and is easily the most typically ''epic'' in the most literal terms of the word\r\nthanks to its build and huge atmosphere - this song also features some of the most impressive and\r\nbad-ass riffs on the album, sometimes bordering on metal! Well done, none the less. <B>Closer</B>\r\ncloses the album with another soft and emotional number - a perfect end to a magnificent album.<p>IQ does not cease to impress with their latest effort, so whether you fancy yourself a fan of the\r\nband or not, this is a must-have for the progressive scene this year. Perhaps a little 'retro'\r\nstill, the band manages to blend the modern and the old-school on this album in a way that they were\r\nattempting to on the last effort - and yet they still manage to break new ground. Don't be surprised\r\nif a lot of neo-progressive bands start to sound like this over the next couple of years. Hopefully\r\nIQ doesn't leave us in the dark for another 4 years! This one is going to get 4 airwaves out of 5,\r\ntruly impressive.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=216794#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=216794\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=216794\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, May 20, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #216794)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20309\"><strong>Roj</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20309\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20309/spanners.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt can sometimes be difficult to write reviews of albums by your favourite bands.  However \r\nwith Frequency I find this not to be a problem, and after 6 listenings I know this album like \r\nthe back of my hand.<p>It's typical IQ as the band stick to what they do best, that is playing the symphonic \r\nprogressive music that their fans love.  However, in content the album is not one of their \r\nbest, there are too many weak points for that.  That is relative as IQ are responsible for \r\nsome of the best prog albums of the last 25 years.  Overall though, it is a fine album and in \r\nmy opinion far superior to Dark Matter, which only had the incredible Sacred Sound as a \r\nhigh point.<p>The production on Frequency is great and vocally Nicholls has never been better.  I do miss \r\nMartin Orford's keyboard playing to be honest.  We'll have to wait until the next album to see \r\nhow Westworth shapes up with material he has had more of a hand in writing.  His \r\ncontribution is a lot less emphasised than Orford's was.  However the main point of note is \r\nthe incredible drumming of Andy Edwards, I find his contribution stunning and without \r\ndoubt the best percussive performance on any IQ album.  He is now on hiatus and will be \r\nsorely missed by both IQ and Frost*.<p>Frequency - \r\nI love this.  A brilliant opener, I can only describe this as a really typical IQ track, a comment \r\nwhich I consider a big compliment. IQ at their best and one of the best on the album.<p>Life Support - \r\nThis has really grown on me.  A shorter song which is very atmospheric.  I love the proggy \r\nchorus.  Another fine track.<p>Stronger Than Friction - \r\nThis track was originally Crashed And Burned (featured on the bonus Frequency DVD) and \r\nI have to say I prefer the original.  STF is a bit wimpy to start, but it's a really good song and \r\nthe last five minutes as the band launch into the instrumental is truly outstanding.<p>One Fatal Mistake - \r\nThe mistake was to include this on the album.  A very quiet song, and whilst I appreciate a \r\nbreak is needed after the first 3 tracks, I'm not keen on this one.<p>Ryker Skies - \r\nWow!  How good is this?  What a fantastic track.  It's dark and doomy, very proggy and with \r\na brilliant chorus.  Destined to be an IQ classic and for me the best on the album.<p>The Province - \r\nThe longest track on the album starts very promisingly and is building up really well.  Then \r\nthe band enter a Suppers Ready Apocalypse in 9/8ish sound-a-like section to echo the one \r\nthey've already visited on Harvest Of Souls.  The keyboard solo is pretty near the bone to be \r\nhonest.  This for me spoils an otherwise excellent track.<p>Closer - \r\nThis is a really nice quieter song, but should have been a few minutes shorter.<p>So there are a few weaker points but on the whole it's a really good album.  If the 9/8 \r\nkeyboard solo on The Province was not there, this would be over 4 stars for me.  I rate it at \r\n3.75 stars, but I'll round up to 4, as I know many others will like the tracks that I'm not that \r\nkeen on.  <p>It's better than Dark Matter, but certainly not as good as The Seventh House or Subterranea \r\nin my opinion.  An essential for IQ fans without a doubt. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219608#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219608\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=219608\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 3, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #219608)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8691\"><strong>Flucktrot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8691\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070908_201329_joshuatree.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nNothing quite like a new IQ album to get this progger out of hibernation. <p>I have always appreciated IQ's restraint in not flooding the market with tons of material that is\r\njust not very good. I have never treasured any IQ album as an outstanding whole piece, but I can\r\nalways count on finding at least a half hour or so of music that I find interesting and of high\r\nquality, and Frequency fits right in.<p>Overall, IQ sounds \"fuller\" to me on this album, with more fills by Edwards and plenty of layering\r\nof keys by Westworth. Both members have done fine in their new IQ roles by contributing to the IQ\r\nsound but still moving the band toward a more modern sound. Of course, Holmes and Jowitt are rock\r\nsolid on guitars. Also, Nicholls continues to improve, as his contributions never detract (unlike\r\nsome older IQ albums) and oftentimes really bring the powerful sections over the top.<p>Highlights: Frequency, Stronger than Friction, The Province of the King. All of these tracks feature\r\nclassic IQ traits that I always look forward to such as subtle time changes, structures that really\r\nmaintain momentum, and great counterbalance between the guitar/keyboard section and the\r\nbass/percussion section. The title track is a fantastic start to the album--it's quite heavy, but it\r\nalso has the classic IQ restraint in introducing new melodies at just the right time. Stronger than\r\nFriction just may IQ's Cinema Show (of course on a much smaller impact scale!), starting with a\r\ncatchy and bouncy tune and finishing with a rousing 7/8 flourish (and excellent transition to the\r\nslower One Fatal Mistake). <p>The Province of the King might be the track where IQ experiments a bit more in song structure. For\r\nexample, a haunting guitar/vocal start kicks into high gear and then moves right back to mellow. My\r\nexperience with IQ is that they don't tease--when they build things up, they almost always maintain\r\nthe momentum. No matter though, because the second half features a classic menacing organ/synth\r\nsection, some truly fantastic vocals by Nicholls, and of course the well-earned majestic guitar solo\r\nby Holmes. <p>IQ doesn't change by leaps and bounds, but this album is hardly recognizable when compared to their\r\nfirst, Tales from the Lush Attic. I have really enjoyed following this band's career and evolving\r\nsound, and I think they are quite good at their craft at this point. Harvest of Souls was a final\r\nsend-off for the \"classic\" line-up, and Frequency represents a new step in a somewhat new, yet\r\nsatisfying, direction. Here's to one more piece of high quality prog!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219646#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219646\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=219646\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 3, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #219646)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ is a band that I usually like. I've seen them live three times of which the last show took place \r\nat the Spirit of 66 in my country (April 26). I was then able to get a preview of this album (with \r\nPaul Cook on the drum kit!).<p>During this concert, two new tracks were definitely outstanding from this offering: the opener \r\nand title track as well as the long ''The Province''. And while I listened to the album for the first \r\ntime, I got the confirmation.<p>And this is a bit my problem with ''Frequency''. I would say that this is a typical ''IQ'' album. \r\nSame fine but melancholic Nicholls, same keyboards-oriented music (I know Martin is gone \r\nand difficult to be replaced but Mark is a very good key player as well and a charming person: I \r\nhad a short talk about Grey Lady Down after the show). Some nice and emotional guitar \r\nbreaks to fulfil the job (the one from ''The Province'' is really excellent) .<p>''Frequency'' is a pleasant neo-prog album but it lacks in diversity (like several IQ albums). I \r\nwas more charmed by ''Dark Matter'' and their first two albums to be honest (all of them rated \r\nwith four stars). <p>This one belongs more to the good works they have released during their long career. Not a \r\nsingle weak track that's for sure although the repetitive ''Closer'' (the well-named closing \r\nnumber) is not the best of their repertoire to be honest and could have been shorter. But on \r\nthe other hand, only two great songs.<p>Three stars.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219783#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=219783\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=219783\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, June 4, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #219783)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=21717\"><strong>lazland</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=21717\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/21717/C9F46CF2-046E-4575-B1C8-33DFCCEEC05A.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWell, we've been waiting for this for a long time. Was it worth the wait? My opinion is yes. IQ are\r\ndefinitely one of the most important bands to emerge from the second wave of prog bands in the\r\n1980's, alongside Marillion, Pallas, and Twelfth Night, and deserve our attention when a new album\r\nis released. But would they deliver with the loss of one of their guiding lights, Martin Orford? The\r\nanswer is a definite yes.<p>Frequency, the title track, is a slab of pure unadulterated neo prog music, with an epic feel that\r\nhas your toes tapping throughout.. Holmes delivers superb guitar bursts, and Westworth, the\r\nsuccessor to Orford, makes you wonder if he really is a new boy with the textures he creates.<p>As the opener progresses to Life Support, the piano backdrop to Nicholl's incredible vocals is\r\namazing, and a reaffirmation of just what a great band they are. Peter Nicholls shines throughout\r\nthis album and I do believe that he is becoming more and more accomplished as a vocalist as the\r\nyears roll on. The mid section features some fantastic interplay between Jowitt and Edwards in the\r\nrhythm section accompanying a great guitar solo by Holmes, before Westworth again attempts to make\r\nthe keyboard slot his own. A dark and meandering piece that grows on you each time you listen to it.<p>Stronger Than Fiction, clocking in at over 10 minutes, starts off with a commercial feel, and could\r\nbe accused of being a stereotypical IQ piece, but I think that as the track develops this is belied.\r\nNicholl's most definitely keeps the track together, and I am enjoying the upbeat feel of the track.\r\nI especially like Westworth's keyboard textures as the track moves to its mid section, in glorious\r\nharmony with quite the most beautiful vocal. The rockier sequence that follows has a dark and\r\nmelancholic feel to it, before reasserting a more upbeat tone with a strong guitar and rhythm\r\nbackdrop. Holme's almost sings on his guitar at the close of the piece, with some lovely piano and\r\nbass accompanying.<p>One Fatal Mistake follows without a break, and is a natural follow up to its predecessor. Nicholl's\r\nvoice is quite incredible, with piano, acoustic guitar vying for attention. I have to say that\r\nNicholl's has become one of the most important and beautiful vocalists in the world of prog - his\r\nperformance on this, and, indeed, the whole of the album, is really something else.<p>What follows is nothing short of genius. Ryker Skies could well be one of the finest pieces of music\r\never created by this band. A rich backdrop of keyboards and acoustic guitar accompany the vocals,\r\nbefore the dark electric guitar, pulsating bass and drums kick in. What follows cannot be\r\nstereotyped as neo prog or any other type of prog. This is simply a fine slab of rock music which\r\nmust have taken all of the five years taken to create this album. Dark, brooding, solid, with a\r\ncounter to all those who believe that the future will automatically be bright and chirpy, the mood\r\ncreated is ultimately distopian. This is exemplified about seven minutes in by a grand Westworth\r\nkeyboard solo, which reminds me a bit of Banks in his darker moments, culminating in him\r\naccompanying Nicholls to the conclusion of the track.<p>The Province of the King is the longest track on the album, and commences with a gorgeous acoustic\r\nguitar and keyboard backdrop to Nicholl's fine vocals. This track is the natural follow up to much\r\nof Dark Matter. I love the mellotron sequence that precedes the heavy pulsating rockier phase,\r\nbefore calming down again to the rich acoustic background. This track has many moods, and is all the\r\nbetter for it.  Probably the finest mellotron moods for many a year, interspersed with some fine\r\nguitar solos and vocals. When \"The phone rings and there's no one there\", the track progresses to a\r\nsymphonic masterpiece, with keyboards at the forefront of a huge cacophony of sound. Although still\r\ndark, it is strangely uplifting. Westworth is a fine successor to a great player - we miss Orford,\r\nbut you know the band will definitely continue, given the exceptional musicianship demonstrated\r\nhere. Has Holmes ever produced such a fine solo as the one kicking in about 11 minutes into this\r\ntrack? I doubt it very much, and Westworth really shines in the piano when Nicholl's brings the\r\npiece to its denouement. A great way to bring a great track to its conclusion. <p>Closer brings the album to its conclusion. Once again starting with some lovely sound textures, I\r\nclose my eyes in appreciation when Nicholl's starts singing. This is not just any neo prog - it's IQ\r\nneo prog! Band plays its heart out in support of some exceptional and beautiful vocals. The band\r\nshines throughout. A grandoise track to close a great piece of work.<p>Was the album worth the wait? Definitely. Have they lost something with Orford? Yes, is the reply.\r\nIs it iretriveable? NO. Is this band still at the forefront of the second wave of prog rock? Absolutely.<p>Closer Every Day sums it up - we feel close to a band that is still capable of producing great\r\nmusic. As an IQ fan, I find this album essential. As a reviewer on this site, I rate it as\r\nexcellent. So, 4.5 stars to an album that really is extremely good. <p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220034#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220034\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=220034\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, June 6, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #220034)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5162\"><strong>Evolver</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Crossover &amp; JR/F/Canterbury Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5162\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5162/ec.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI don't have all that much exposure to the music of IQ, although I do own a copy of \"Are You \r\nSitting Comfortably?\", which I haven't listened to in years.  But this album makes me want to \r\nrevisit it.<p>The album isn't perfect, there seems to be something about Peter Nicholls' vocals that I can't \r\nquite place that puts me off, and the music during most of the verse sections of the songs can \r\nget a bit drab, but when the band goes off instrumentally, the songs soar.  Luckily, the good \r\nparts far outweigh the bad, so I give this album thumbs up.<p>My copy also includes a live DVD of a full concert recorded in Holland in 2007, including two of \r\nthe songs from the new album, one under a different title with different lyrics.  The performance \r\nthroughout is flawless, although the camerawork sometimes jostles, and be warned, the \r\nconcert was not filmed in high def, so it looks somewhat grainy on larger televisions.

Since then there's been some major line-up \r\nchanges with drummer Paul Cook and keyboardist Martin Orford both departing to be \r\nreplaced by Andy Edwards and Mark Westworth respectively. Naturally it was a major \r\nconcern, particularly with the loss of Orford if they could still cut it. Fortunately they can; in \r\nfact Frequency is as good as anything they've done in the past. What you get is 7 tracks \r\nover 62 minutes including the almost obligatory epic; here it's The Province that runs to \r\nalmost 14 minutes.<p>The album kicks off with the excellent title track with a kind of Zeppelin style Kashmir riff \r\nthough they subtly shift the beat around. Things quieten down for Peter Nicholls \r\nmelancholic vocals backed by electric piano and then were into very familiar IQ territory with \r\nsome searing guitar runs from the excellent Mike Holmes. A grandiose statement to kick \r\nthings off.<p>Life Support has a very familiar IQ sound, more in their restrained mode. A lovely melody \r\nprevails over the piano/vocal led start until things kick in with an excellent instrumental \r\nsection, drums now joining in and some more strong guitar work from Holmes and John \r\nJowitt's excellent bass work nicely cutting through. <p>At 10 and a half minutes Stronger Than Friction is the second longest track on the album. \r\nWhile it's kind of IQ by numbers, neo prog effortlessly done by a band that have been at it \r\nfor almost 30 years, its enjoyable enough but plods along for the first 6 minutes until things \r\nget more interesting with a change of tack into more dynamic playing. Stronger Than \r\nFriction segues into One Fatal Mistake which finds the band in ballad mode. This in turn \r\nleads straight into Ryker Skies, a track that could have been heard pre release of the album \r\nhaving featured on a free cd with the latest edition of Classic Rock Prog. It was a good \r\nchoice to give some much needed exposure to this excellent album. After a quiet vocal intro \r\nit comes in with a simple and solid straight rhythm with Jowitt's bass pounding away \r\nbeneath Edward's solid drum pattern. It's one of those tracks that immediately gets under \r\nthe skin with a memorably melodic chorus and strong dominant keyboards, Holmes' guitar \r\ntaking more of a back seat on this one.<p>Pleasingly with The Province being the longest track it's also the best. An acoustic guitar \r\nled intro gives way to a short, bombastic instrumental section before a quick return to the \r\nvocals and then we're back into IQ at their most powerful and heaviest. There's some \r\nparticularly fine keyboard work from Westworth including a nice organ sound, proving he's \r\na worthy replacement for Orford. The track goes through quite a few changes with plenty of \r\ndynamics to keep things interesting.<p>The album closes on a high with Closer, a largely laid back track though with some \r\npowerful moments well placed after the bombast of The Province.<p>I'm pleased to say that despite the loss of 2 long serving members since Dark Matter IQ \r\nare capable of producing such a strong album that can easily stand along side their best \r\nwork. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking here but it's a very worthwhile purchase \r\nfor fans of the band and symphonic/neo prog in general.<p><p><p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220263#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=220263\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=220263\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, June 8, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #220263)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8096\"><strong>Tarcisio Moura</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8096\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/8096/unspoken_Whisper.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI waited for this CD with some caution. After all I am a big fan of IQ and I  am one of those who \r\nthought that  martin Orford was the  heart and soul of the band, even more than vocalist Peter\r\nNicholls. To me it was very hard to believe in  IQ without him.  I was already saddened by his\r\nleaving of Jadis, but that was to be expected. But retiring from the music business? From IQ? From\r\nHIS band IQ?  I was not sure if they should even consider to soldier on without the band's mains\r\ncharacter (shades of early Genesis, anyone?). So I was curious, but highly suspicious, when this CD\r\ncame out. Fortunatly my fears were unfounded, at least for now.<p>Frequency is as good an IQ D as any of their recent discography. The new keyboardsman  Mark\r\nWestworth fitted in perfectly as far as I'm concerned. The  CD starts with the title track: waves\r\nand  waves of mellotron sounding keys, followed by Fender Rhodes piano, moogs and all those great\r\nanalog keyboard instruments all the way through the entire disc. From the first notes you know the\r\nband remains the same and that you're gonna love this record. Guitarrist Mark Holmes might be the\r\nonly member now to be featured on all IQ's catalogue, but the other band members know how to keep\r\nthe old flame alive. Besides, they lost none of the latter day inspiration that brought them to\r\nproduce such fine works like Subterranea and Dark matter.<p>Ok, the CD is not perfect. Clearly I miss an epic of the same stature as Harvest Of Souls (from Dark\r\nMatter). But since the band seemed to be washed away just a few months ago, I guess this would be\r\nexpecting too much. And Frequency has some very strong moments like the title track and the\r\nbeautiful, poignant One Fatal Mistake. There are no fillers either.  Like one reviewer wrote, I hope\r\nthis new CD is a truly product of the new line up and not the  remains of Orford's work before he \r\nleft. (I guess not).  In any case, Fequency  stands as one of IQ's best works and it is an excellent\r\naddtition to any prog lover collection. Nice surprise. Four stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=223616#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=223616\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=223616\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 28, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #223616)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4698\"><strong>loserboy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=4698\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/4698/albumcover1.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI have found the frequency ! I first heard the title song during the last time IQ played in Canada \r\n(Montreal) and remember saying that that it was an instant love. This album would prove to be \r\na bit of a re-start for this band as well with 2 new members bringing their musical influences \r\ninto the group, which I can tell you has not changed the frame of IQ....only the pillow cases ! \r\nThose holding out to see the reviews can rest at ease and go pick up this album with \r\nconfidence as this is very much a prototypical IQ album with their highly well crafted signature \r\nsymphonic dark prog songs narrated by the pungent lyrics of Peter Nicholls. I too was a tad \r\nnervous as Dark Matter I thought was just \"Beyond brilliant\" and that would be a hard one to \r\ntop, which I dont think they did to be honest but it is still a very very very good album. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=223934#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=223934\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=223934\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 30, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #223934)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHow consistant has this band been with Peter Nicholls as their vocalist ? Well the \r\nseven studio albums he has sung on are all rated around 4 stars. And the thing is there is \r\nno agreement on which one is their best. Any one of those seven could be a favourite of an \r\nIQ fan. Some lineup changes on this one with drummer Paul Cook leaving and being \r\nreplaced by Andy Edwards from FROST. So we have the FROST rhythm section at work \r\nhere. And the great Martin Orford has left to be replaced by Mark Westworth on \r\nkeyboards. Speaking of FROST, the band thanks Declan Burke among others.<p>\r\n\"Frequency\" opens with different samples of broadcasts before the drums and mellotron \r\ncome crashing in.The guitar a minute in is fantastic, synths follow. A calm with piano 2 \r\nminutes in, then the master vocalist Mr.Nicholls starts to sing as only he can. Haunting \r\nguitar sounds come and go. It kicks in at 4 minutes with some nice drum \r\nwork. Guitar, mellotron and synths come and go. Jowitt is prominant with some nice bass \r\nlines. Just a great sounding track. I love this band !  \"Life Support\" opens with piano and \r\nreserved vocals. When the vocals stop 2 1/2 minutes in check out the atmosphere. Guitar \r\nand drums come in and I like the bass after 4 minutes. Nice synth work too. More great \r\natmosphere after 6 minutes. <p>\"Stronger Than Fiction\" features a strong rhythm section as \r\nthe guitar plays over top. Vocals before a minute. It settles 4 minutes in and doesn't pick \r\nback up until after 6 minutes. Mellotron 7 1/2 minutes in, and it's so uplifting 8 minutes in \r\nwhen the guitar joins in. Amazing ! The song eventually blends into \"One Fatal Mistake\" \r\nwhich is such a beautiful and laid back tune. Check out the lyrics: \"You broke me, you have \r\nno idea. In darkness, I see more than hear. Impossible, even I can say. Many would have \r\nwalked away. A lifetime of living a lie. Like daylight shot out of the sky. So did the truth ever set \r\nyou free ? Got nothing but that hold on me\". Love the atmosphere 4 1/2 minutes in then it \r\nblends into \"Ryker Skies\". Reserved vocals come out of the spacy sounds and strummed \r\nguitar. It kicks in before 1 1/2 minutes. Nice guitar, drums and bass here. Check out the organ \r\nafter 3 1/2 minutes. An atmospheric calm around 5 1/2 minutes. Vocals and vibes a minute \r\nlater. It kicks back in before 7 1/2 minutes. Lots of synths and drums then mellotron and \r\nvocals join in.<p>The Province\" is the longest track at almost 14 minutes. Acoustic guitar early \r\nas vocals join in. Samples before 2 1/2 minutes then heavy drums and organ \r\ndominate. Incredible ! Mellotron joins in then it settles back down. The contrasts continue. It's \r\nso emotional when it kicks in before 4 1/2 minutes. Soaring guitar before 10 1/2 \r\nminutes. Piano and vocals end it. \"Closer\" opens with guitar as the atmosphere rolls \r\nin. Vocals before a minute. Drums and bass a minute later. It kicks in before 4 minutes with \r\ndrums and organ then Peter cries out the words \"Hold on...\". The lyrics are so meaningful \r\nand emotional in this song.<p>\r\nThey did it again ! Not surprised just happy. God bless IQ.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=224781#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=224781\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=224781\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 6, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #224781)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9836\"><strong>tszirmay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9836\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/9836/Roxy.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is one I have been itching, bitching and scratching to first listen intently and then \r\nreview. In fact, my dear sinkadotentree beat me to the punch but graciously (as only he can \r\nso naturally) informed me by PM that I will anoint this with 5 stars, when I get my hands and \r\nears on it! I hugely enjoyed the previous \"Dark Matter\" and even saw the support show and \r\nwas suitably blown away by their mastery of their craft. They have been accused of Marillion \r\nclones but I have severe doubts about that assumption as Nicholls is nowhere near the \r\nesteemed Fish in delivery, lyrical chicanery and stage persona. Peter is an altogether \r\ndifferent fish (pun intended), closer to Gabriel if anyone as I see a vocal personality here, \r\nhis voice only aging like the finest wine, supremely confident and evocative. This is a band \r\nthat seems to grow (progress?.hahahaha!) with each release and slaloming through the \r\nperils of losing retiring members on keys and drums. It must be said that Martin Orford's \r\ndeparture could have been worrisome but the others certainly picked up the slack, most \r\nassuredly proving that Holmes is a way underrated talent. \"Frequency\" starts off with a \r\ndelirious glee, as new keyboardist Mark Westwood unleashes copious doses of electronic \r\nbeeping and swaths of dense mellotron , synthing hand in hand with Mike Holmes \r\nromantic and graceful guitar lines , master bassist Jowitt blasting the relentless beat \r\nahead with colleague Andy Edwards drumming up a storm. \"Life Support\" has all the \r\nhallmarks to illuminate the progressive highway, restrained \u00fcber-melodies that are so \r\ntypically British, a piano driven reasoning of elegance , the liquid solo that carves deep into \r\nthe \"spectral mornings\" that can only hearken back to Hackett's glory days. What a \r\nmomentous piece of progressive genius that should be lapped up by all fans of prog (while \r\nmany consider IQ to be \"Neo\", I personally judge them to be firmly in the symphonic \r\nelement). The richness of the arrangements are always so convincing, especially when \r\nheard (and proven right) in a live setting. The epic \"Stronger Than Fiction\" is a reptilian \r\nescapade that rumbles onward like some crazed mechanical beast with Nicholls singing \r\nhis spirit out, wrapped in a moody tirade that charms and seduces, very much in the typical \r\nIQ formula with deep furrowed tempo contrasts between the sweet pastoral and the \r\ndisturbingly frantic. Another winning track, will it go, all, the, way?? (as Berman would say). \r\nThe stately axe flight soars this fiction all the way to the stars, a powerful sortie that utterly \r\nconvinces. \"One Fatal Mistake\" is an oddity, an IQ ballad that evokes the misery of love, \r\nloaded with soporific keys and piano motifs that underline the plaintive vocal. A nice little \r\nlove interlude that dies in a choir mellotron curtsy! \"Ryker Skies\" is a more somber affair \r\nthat relates to the paranoia of social disease, sounding more like the recent and harder \r\nedged Galahad, a brutish beat that swerves into sonic gloom. The choir-trons create \r\nmassive damage whilst the synth slashes burrow deeply, the marshalling beat remains \r\nunflinching. The 13 minute \"The Province\" is the killer track here, a masterful stroke of aural \r\nbliss that is perhaps the most symphonic piece they have ever written. Acoustic guitars \r\nstring their web across the Peter Nicholls swoon, heartfelt lyrics that dance with the lungs \r\nand then a suddenly raging riff enters the fray, blasting imperially into submission. The \r\nattractive pattern from soft to hard is repeated again to great effect, giving Edwards the \r\nplatform to bash around like a monster. Epic indeed, an immense piece that will need nay \r\nmore revisits to truly appreciate.  \"Closer\" as the name implies is the final opus, a mirroring \r\nlilt that floats serenely amid sadly defiant and despondent lyrics that express the current \r\nworld's tears. They ostensibly pay attention to the world around them, displaying the unique \r\ncharm of blending disappointment with hope. The chorus is a sonic rainbow of majesty, a \r\nharrowing punctuation mark on another classic IQ recording.  A magnificent album that \r\ndeserves the penta stars but it's too early yet to knock \"Dark Matter\" off the podium. 5 radio \r\ntowers nevertheless.  Right again, sinky!    </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=225352#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=225352\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=225352\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, July 9, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #225352)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBy now you should have known my musical taste (mostly) because you can see my rating to this IQ's\r\nlatest album. Yes, IQ has been in my listening pressure since their debut album and I always\r\npurchase the new album of the band which unfortunately took a long time to produce. I had been\r\nwaiting for this new album for approx five years, but it's worth waiting for because its individual\r\nalbum is an excellent one. And I would say that IQ is a king of neoprog that has been consistent\r\nwith its musical direction especially since their phenomenal album 'Ever'. I would say since then\r\ntheir music has been so solid so that whenever I spin the album I tend to play it in its entirety\r\nbecause it sounds like listening to the whole story of the album.<p>I actually pre-ordered this album before its official release early Jun 2009. But due to economic\r\nconsideration in ordering I clicked also the pre-order of Dream Theater's 'Clack Clouds & Silver\r\nLinings' which was released three weeks after IQ, June 23 2009. The result was on delivery of the\r\nCDs which came quite late to my address. Practically I only received the package two days ago and I\r\nhad never heard any song of the two bands new albums, with the exception of IQ 'Frequency' which I\r\never watched its live performance on youtube. \r\nWhen the two reached my address, my first attention was of course to 'Frequency' because I had been\r\ntoo curious on how the album sounds like. I could predict that their style would not change but I\r\nwas curious about the melody-line. IQ has been so perfect in creating songs with killing melodies\r\nespecially since their 'Ever' album. After I spun this album, I tried to spin Dream Theater 'BC &\r\nSL' but unfortunately I easily dropped it after one spin in its entirety. Nothing new with DT music\r\nand unfortunately in this new album DT sounds like not producing songs with catchy melody like\r\nOctavarium's 'Sacrificed Sons' or Systematic Chaos's 'Forsaken'. Honestly I am a bit getting bored\r\nwith DT especially in its sequel on alcohol which lends melodies from previous songs in the sequel.\r\nSo I spun IQ and temporary stopped DT.<p><strong>Compositions that kill me ...!</strong><p>How do you rate composition? For me, there are five components that form a final rating of musical\r\ncomposition. First, is the melody - i.e. the degree to which the main melody of the song is\r\nconstructed from a combination of notes. Second is the harmonies ie. how each instrument contributes\r\nin creating sounds and notes. Third is the complexity of the arrangement i.e. the degree in which\r\nthe instrument (including vocal) being played by the musicians and how they generate a piece of\r\nmusic stream or segment of the music. Fourth is change of style i.e. how the style changes in a song\r\nwhich includes tempo changes and/ or heavy or soft musical sounds. The last one (fisth) is the\r\nstructural integrity i.e. the degree to which all musical segments, including changes of style, form\r\na cohesiveness of the music as awhole from start to end. The five components are very fundamental\r\nfor me to assess my rating towards the music, especially progressive music.<p>As a matter of 'Frequency' I can tell you that out of five components that I use to analyze the\r\nmusic, I could summarize that the key dominating components of this album are: catchy melody,\r\nwonderful harmonies, smooth and excellent changes of style and solid structural integrity in almost\r\nall songs this album contains. The composition is actually not complex but complexity does not\r\ndetermine the final rating because for any neoprog and symphonic prog music complexity is only\r\nmedium. Prog with high complexities are the music of Gentle Giant, canterbury and some progressive\r\nmetal.<p>How  can I challenge the opening track 'Frequency' (8:29) with complexity? The arrangements are\r\nbasically simple to medium BUT look at the melody from start to end of the track. And then, look at\r\nthe harmonies the band creates through its simple riffs at the opening and it moves forward\r\nwonderfully to another segment with various styles in great harmonies. The music created can bring\r\nme to an imagination of living in other world. It's totally an amazing composition. And .. the\r\nstructural integrity of the song is really solid from start to end. Unbelievable! It's a master\r\npiece of prog music!<p>The same experience I find in enjoying the otehr tracks like the following 'Life support' (6:28) and\r\n'Stronger than friction' (10:32). All of them have their own melodies and they are all wonderful! So\r\nis the case with 'One fatal mistake' (4:54) - in which the lyric page at the album sleeve depicting\r\na man sitting on a hill which reflects me like a muslim pray. It's an excellent artwork, really!<p>'The Province' (13:43) is a wonderful epic with great overall melody that spans nicely from one\r\nsegment to another while the keyboard by the new member (Westworth) plays wonderful solo combined\r\nwith dynamic bass playing by Jowitt and dynamic drumming by Edwards. One thing for sure this song\r\nhas many style changes but the band maintains the structural integrity of the song in its entirety.<p>Overall, this is a masterpiece release by IQ. On top of composition, the performance of the new\r\nmember of the band (Westworth - keyboard) is worth mentioning. His keyboard work is truly killing!\r\nAlso the production of the CD is great. The package (mine is having 1 CD and 1 DVD) is great and the\r\nsonic production is top notch! It's a MUST album to have! Keep on proggin' ..!

For starters, this one was the item that should prove that \r\nthe creative aspirations that the band had catapulted from their \"Ever\" days hadn't met a \r\ndefinitive high with \"Dark Matter\" - that there was more to this band after spending 25 years \r\nwriting and recording albums.  Also, it was to be the first album without drummer Paul \r\nCook. No one saw it coming, but Martin Orford wasn't going to be present in this album, \r\ntoo. Luckily, the writing process didn't collapse after these desertions - Andy Edwards and \r\nMark Westworth entered the picture and gelled perfectly with their elder colleagues. This \r\nalbum's music remains essential IQ. The namesake track opens up the album to set an \r\nappropriate ambience of musicality and power. The initial WWII  radio transmissions are \r\nfollowed by a mesmeric 'Kashmir'-meets-'Fly on the Windshield' motif, and successively, \r\nthis section is followed by the album's first sung portion, mostly sustained on eerie electric \r\npiano chords progressions. Once things are sped up on a tight 7/8 tempo, the mood sinks \r\ndeeply into familiar IQ territory: solid dynamics and clean harmonic arrangements. The \r\nresulting motif evolves effectively all the way toward the coda, which revives a bit of the \r\naforementioned LZ-meets-Genesis motif. 'Life Support' is next in line, giving up on the \r\nopener's stylish robustness in favor of an enhanced romanticism. Figure out a \r\nrefurbishment of the lyrical sections of 'Guiding Light' under the emotional drive so well \r\naccomplished in the softer passages of the \"Subterranea\" opus, and you might as well \r\nhave a very good notion about what this track's mood is al all about. Once the whole \r\nensemble gets properly settled down, the symphonic accent acquires some clever cosmic \r\ntouches due to the inventive synth solos that take place between Holmes' featured guitar \r\nlines. The cosmic element remains in the eerie finale, which conveniently portrays the \r\nimage of machines operating to sustain a fading life. 'Stronger than Friction' (one of the \r\ncleverest titles ever in the history of prog rock, I bet) bears an epic timespan of 10 \u00bd \r\nminutes. What you get here is not a 'second Darkest Hour' (let alone a 'second Widow's \r\nPeak'), but a catchy exercise on the lighter side of neo-prog, bordering at times with AOR. \r\nLet's imagine what the idea for 'Shooting Angels' would have become had it been gathered \r\nby the Pendragon guys for their \"Masquerade Overture\" album: that's pretty much an \r\napproximated picture of what I'm trying to describe. The 7/8 section that signals the song's \r\nlast part is yet another exciting display of IQ-style fire. The segued ballad 'One Fatal \r\nMistake' is lovely, marked by a clean melodic arrangement that never gets corny: Nicholls' \r\nsinging states that usual vulnerable vibe that has been Peter's signature for ages. Stuff like \r\nthis should dignify commercial radio, and it would do it enormously. The spacey synth \r\nlayers and choral mellotron mark the song's end in a bridge toward the next one, 'Ryker \r\nSkies'. This is another long song, and quite refreshing in this grand scheme of things. It is \r\nrobust and psychedelic -even including electronic excerpts in places-, with a \r\nclear 'Frequency'-oriented undertone to it. In fact, near the end, a quotation from the \r\naforesaid song gets in to fulfill a melodic development. 'The Province' is the longest track \r\nhere. Its patently epic architecture bears a strong heritage from the \"Dark Matter\" days: the \r\ncontrasted mood shifts, the agile use of odd signatures and the whole sonic fulfillment \r\ncomplete an amazing progressive journey. The synth solo delivered after the 8 minute \r\nmark is arguably the best one in the album; the piano-driven closure bears an undisputed \r\nelegant beauty. The album's closer is entitled 'Closer' (go figure!). It fills the album's last \r\n8+ minutes with yet another exhibition of IQ romanticism. It works very well as a prog semi-\r\nballad, featuring a moderately bombastic middle section that seasons the main motif up \r\nfor a while. All in all, this new frequency of IQ shows the same old mastery - \"Frequency\" is \r\nan excellent prog item for 2009.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=225994#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=225994\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=225994\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, July 11, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #225994)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=19044\"><strong>Roland113</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=19044\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/19044/TheCatfishMan.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn My Not So Humble Opinion:<p>\"Frequency\" by IQ was disappointing at best.  I'm sorry IQ, I'm sorry friends of IQ, but this was\r\nnot one of their best efforts.  <p>Let me start by saying that this was my most anticipated release of the year, I love IQ.  I\r\ndutifully preordered the special bonus pack, complete with DVD and eagerly awaited its arrival.  I\r\nhad seen a minute or two of IQ performing \"Frequency\", the song, on YouTube and was eagerly excited\r\nby the prospect of more.  \"Frequency\" sounded so different from IQ's other material, it had an edge,\r\na bit of hardness to it that I wasn't used to.  I was especially excited as I was starting to notice\r\ntoo many similarities in the other IQ CD's that I had (Dark Matter, The Seventh House, Subterranea\r\nand Ever).<p>There is one constant positive throughout the CD.  Michael Holmes sounds wonderful on this CD.  The\r\ntone of his guitar is reminiscent of Daryl Stuermer's work with Genesis, wonderfully haunting.  It\r\nis nice to hear him come to the forefront with the departure of Martin Orford (yes, I know he still\r\nwrote some of the songs for this CD, but you get my point).  One other positive, the artwork is IQ's\r\nbest in my opinion.  The kids with the remote controls and the radio towers strike a chord with me.<p>So the CD started out with \"Frequency\" and I was underwhelmed, they had over compressed the\r\nbeginning.  I was expecting this bright and powerful opening and the sound was unfortunately muted\r\nand muddled.  By the one and a half minute mark, the over compression had taken a back seat to the\r\nlead guitar and keys, but sadly, that first moment of disappointment lingered.  The rest of the song\r\nis beautiful, with Peter Nichols voice sounding more soulful than usual, still beautiful though.<p>\"Life Support\" shows the amazing drumming of Andy Edwards and \"Stronger than Friction\" follows as a\r\ntypical IQ song.  It'd be great on most other band's albums, but it's a bit predictable to me.  John\r\nJowitt is solid on this and shows some particularly tasty chops at about the seven minute mark.<p>\"One Fatal Mistake\" does nothing for me.<p>\"Riker Skies\" is the best song on the album, the vocal run at the two minute mark gives me goose\r\nbumps.  Peter Nichols doubles himself, with a low effect laden voice almost drowning out his normal\r\nvoice.  'Almost' is an important designation as the higher voice, adds the touch that makes it so\r\neerie.  Mark Westworth also plays a very tasteful solo at the three minute and fifty second mark.<p>\"The Province\" is every Genesis and IQ song wrapped into one.  Imagine \"The Cinema Show\" meets \"The\r\nKnife\" meets \"The Seventh House\" meets \"The Narrow Margin\" meets \"Harvest of Souls\" meets \"Supper's\r\nReady\".  Unfortunately, it's already been done.  They even start the clich\u00e9 ending at the nine\r\nminute forty second mark.  You can hear the ending of \"The Seventh House\" start, until apparently\r\nthe band heard the same thing and decided they should change something.  So they added an off chord,\r\nchanged the timing a little.  Sorry guys, the 'Supper's Ending' really isn't working anymore and the\r\nattempt to disguise is just sounds awkward here.<p>Finally they ended the CD with \"Closer\" effectively reprising the \"One Fatal Mistake\" theme that did\r\nnothing for me the first time.  I'm sorry to say that unlike wine and leftover spaghetti sauce, it\r\ndid not improve with time.<p>All in all, it's an ok CD.  If it's your first IQ CD it's probably great and I don't have a problem\r\nwith that.  I think anyone who is into good symphonic will absolutely love their first IQ CD\r\nregardless of which one they pick up.  After a few CDs though, they start to sound the same.  Have\r\nyou noticed that all of the IQ CD's with Peter Nichols CD's are rated between 3.86 and 4.11 (at the\r\ntime of writing).  For seven CD's, that's not much of a spread.  I can't speak for the first two,\r\nbut the reason the last five all have a similar rating is that they're the same album.  I'll give\r\nexamples when I get to Subterranea and Ever.<p>All in all, I was going to give this one a two star rating, but it jumps to 3 stars thanks to \"Ryker\r\nSkies\", Michael Holmes' guitar work and the look of the package.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=227347#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=227347\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=227347\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 17, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #227347)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOne of the best albums of the year. <p>Unlike Subterranea, which lost focus somewhere in the middle, Frequency is a concept \r\nalbums that smoothly flows from beginning to end without ever becomeing boring or \r\nconfusing. <p>As always, the focus in IQ's music is the melody. The guitar is mostly in charge of providing the \r\nmelodic support for the whole musical building, which leaves behind the equally-excellent but \r\nless-purely-neo-prog sound of Dark Matter with its short songs in favor of long, thoroughly \r\ndeveloped anthems that take some time to digest but which reveal their magic after repeated \r\nlistens. <p>The title track is, in my view, the best IQ song ever, with an impulse and drive unrivaled in most \r\nneo-prog. The band is clearly the flag-carrier of the genre as MARILLION has long ago left the \r\nprogressive territories and other legendary bands have been producing erratic efforts. \r\nFrequency, unashamedly neo-prog in the best tradition of post-Hackett GENESIS and Fish-\r\nMARILLION, is the best album of IQ so far, and maybe the best of 2009. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=229065#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=229065\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=229065\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, July 30, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #229065)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=2666\"><strong>Prog-jester</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=2666\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/2666/fdf.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFrequency is the least fitting word to describe IQ's albums releasing activity, he-he-he. But \r\nwhen they make it, they usually hit the spot. The problem is that \"Dark Matter\" was not only \r\nband's crowning achievement, but also genre's resurrection's grinding stone, and it's simply \r\nimpossible to create something better. \"Frequency\" brings us back in \"The Seventh \r\nHouse\"/\"Ever\" times, a fine album with amazing epics, touchy ballads and shorter energetic \r\nsongs. Melodies are a bit bleak, and ballads are too sentimental this time; IQ are getting older, \r\nbut they still remember how to rock (the long ones and the opener serve as examples)!

It took a few days for this album to sink in, but it sure did.<p>IQ has found the wellspring of musical youth, it appears. Each album is fresher and more inspiring\r\nthan the last (considering that I don't really care for their 80s and early 90s material). I thought\r\nthey could never top \"Harvest of Souls\", but they have. This album is divided as always between\r\nepics and more melodic rock songs. Founding member Martin Orford's departure doesn't seem to have\r\naffected things negatively at all. In fact, the keyboards have taken a turn more for the vintage\r\nwith Mark Westwood's arrival- there are more vintage-sounding synths as well as some Rhodes and the\r\nusual mellotron touches. Occasionally there are passages that are downright ambient, as though the\r\nband was jamming with Steve Roach (a good thing), a nice new colour in the band's palette.<p>The songwriting is dramatic (\"Frequency\", \"Ryker Skies\") and beautifully melodic, (\"One Fatal\r\nMistake\", \"Closer\"). IQ as always rides the line between prog complexity and AOR melodicism, with a\r\nnice edge provided by Peter Nicholl's excellent, thoughtful lyrics. Both John Jowitt and Mike Holmes\r\nas always distinguish themselves on bass and guitar, being virtuosic but never wanky. <p>Much like \"Dark Matter\", which was worth the price for \"Harvest of Souls\" alone, this album is worth\r\nyour money for \"Closer\", as perfect a piece of melodic symphonic prog as you will find. <p>IQ is living proof that you can get better as you get older. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=234430#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=234430\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=234430\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, August 23, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #234430)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17614\"><strong>Epignosis</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17614\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17614/Langella.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIf I had to make a comparison between IQ's 2009 offering and a classic progressive rock artist, I\r\nwould urge all fans of early Steve Hackett to seek out this album.  That isn't to say that the band\r\nis in any way plagiarizing anything- the IQ sound is still present- I just feel that's an accurate\r\ncomparison given the instrumentation, guitar tones, and arrangements.  Ultimately this is a stately\r\nand respectable album- a must have for fans of the genre and definitely for those pleased with IQ's\r\nwork this decade.<p>\"Frequency\"  A simple, hard-rocking riff with a Kashmir-eqsue rhythm underlain with Mellotron paves\r\na solid foundation for the first guitar and synthesizer solos on the album.  Electric piano and\r\nweepy guitar come forth after that, giving way to the welcome vocals.  The rest of the song is at\r\nonce heavy and majestic, with that airy Mellotron hovering in the background.<p>\"Life Support\"  Gorgeous piano is enveloped by airy pads just before the thoughtful vocals enter.  I\r\nthink the drums deserve some praise, as I found that's what I tend to concentrate on even during a\r\nmasterful guitar solo; all in all, the instrumental section of this song hearkens back to Steve\r\nHackett's darker solo material from the early days.<p>\"Stronger than Friction\"  I've made this comparison before (not for this band), but the introduction\r\nto this song sounds quite a bit like music from Mega Man X, an old series created for the Super\r\nNintendo (and, as I've mentioned before, there's nothing wrong with that at all- music created for\r\ncertain video game titles is brilliant- I can just imagine running through a level as the blue\r\nbomber and blasting everything that gets in the way).  Almost halfway through, the piece changes\r\nshape, assuming an unassuming, light guitar and soft synthesizer, again sounding like early Steve\r\nHackett.  While not flawless, this is a full and mighty composition, boasting that perfect blend of\r\nvariety and consistency.<p>\"One Fatal Mistake\"  This piece sounds like one of the post-Neal Morse ballads from Spock's Beard. \r\nFor something so simple and low-key, it's a wonderful song.<p>\"Ryker Skies\"  Thick acoustic guitar cuts through an airy atmosphere; in a way it reminds me of \"Fly\r\non a Windshield\" by Genesis even though the two songs are quite different.  I don't particularly\r\ncare for this track as much, since it is too electronic-based and rather generic in several\r\nrespects.  There is a fantastic organ interlude; however, it's stay is far too brief.  To\r\ncompensate, there's some fabulous synthesizer work toward the end. <p>\"The Province\"  The longest track on the album begins with picked acoustic guitar and gentle\r\nsynthesizer.  It gets suddenly heavier, with lots of thundering chords and drums.  Just before the\r\nsecond half commences, a sinister organ and electric guitar bit takes over, introducing a new vocal\r\nmelody, effectively keeping the song fresh.  I think the synthesizer tone during the big solo is\r\nreally different, but fitting at the same time.  The final minute consists of gentle piano and\r\nsoothing vocals.  I believe the piece could have been trimmed down if some of the dross had been cut\r\nout, but overall, it's a brilliant work, although not as a good as any of the first three.<p>\"Closer\"  Bright guitar begins the final, uplifting track.  It's a feel-good and mostly gentle\r\n(though upbeat) track, and a fine closer.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=245207#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=245207\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=245207\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 19, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #245207)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18139\"><strong>poslednijat_colobar</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18139\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18139/Ic&#111;na_prog_1.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> Feeling is everything </strong> <p>\r\nThe first I want to say about this album is it's full of energy and melancholy. It begins promising\r\nwith a couple of very good songs with very good musicianship and songwriting. In fact, I would\r\ndivide this album to two halfs, if I'm speaking about my interest in IQ's Frequency. The first half\r\ncontains from first to fourth song. The homonymous song - Frequency is the most memorable and\r\npowerful song on the album. I would call it a breakthrough on the whole album. Next songs are very\r\ngood, too and contain some frash ideas. Next half contains three songs, from fifth to seventh.\r\nHonestly, I'm loosing interest around the beginning of it. The album becomes too long for so\r\nunvaried record. The album run out of ideas and become monotonous. Because of this lost of speed and\r\nfresh energy I'll give 3,5 stars to Frequency.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=251518#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=251518\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=251518\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, November 18, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #251518)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20672\"><strong>J-Man</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20672\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20672/10363795_667676003270041_3933815434573087984_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>Stronger Than Friction...</B><p>IQ is one of my favorite modern progressive rock bands, and Frequency was one of my most anticipated\r\nreleases of 2009. Initially I didn't like this album at all, and I can't reasonably say why. This\r\nalbum has a more edgy modern prog sound, and almost completely ditches the neo-prog label that\r\nthey've been slowly getting rid of over the years. I thought maybe it could be because Martin Orford\r\nwas no longer present, even though Mark Westworth does a great job.<p>After originally being disappointed, I decided to give Frequency another chance recently, and I\r\nreally enjoyed it! I can't say why suddenly I began liking this album, but it is excellent. Great\r\nsynths, Steve Hackett sounding guitar, and spacey Mellotrons create the unique IQ experience.<p><B>THE MUSIC:</B><p>\"Frequency\"- The first song on this great album opens up with sound effects that build into a heavy\r\nrepeated bassline with great use of the mellotron. This is followed by a guitar solo. After the\r\nheavier section dies down a gloomy electric piano section enters. It builds really well into the\r\nbeautiful chorus. This is a pretty atmospheric section, and it reminds me a bit of Porcupine Tree.\r\nSoon the signature IQ sound enters, and Peter Nicholls delivers an exceptional vocal performance. I\r\nlove the bassline throughout most of this song. The keyboards are excellent as well. One of my\r\nfavorites off of the album!<p>\"Life Support\"- After the great previous song, this song mostly builds off of a main piano melody\r\nline. After a short break, a melodic guitar solo and funky bassline begin. The rest of the song just\r\nbuilds from this bassline, and I particularly like one of the synth solos. This song has some great\r\nmoments, but it is not one of my favorites from this album.<p>\"Stronger Than Friction\"- A guitar melody opens up this great epic. The bass playing from John\r\nJowitt is solid, and I think he does a great job throughout this entire album. The chorus is really\r\nstrong, and this is one of those cases where it can get stuck in your head for days.  Most of the 10\r\nminutes of this song is made up of the same melodies, but it never gets repetitive or boring. A\r\nhighlight of the album.<p>\"One Fatal Mistake\"- The previous song flows directly into the album's fourth song. This song is\r\nfocused on a beautiful piano and guitar chord progression, and this is a pretty standard\r\nverse-chorus-verse song. However, the excellent melodies keep this song from being a poor pop song.<p>\"Ryker Skies\"- This song opens up with an atmospheric guitar and keyboard sound. Peter's vocals soon\r\nenter and this is followed by a heavy drum and bassline. I think this is a pretty powerful section,\r\nbut I think as a whole this song is not them best from the album. I think the chorus is very good,\r\nbut IQ has better to offer in my opinion.<p>\"The Province\"- This is the longest song on the album, and it doesn't disappoint. I really like the\r\nacoustic guitar that opens up the song. It has good melody, and the song soon turns into a heavy\r\nsection reminding me of \"The Return of The Giant Hogweed\". It goes back into the opening acoustic\r\nsection, but the heavy melodies soon return. This features a great guitar solo near the end, and the\r\nending is very good. <p>\"Closer\"- The closing song is a pretty uplifting affair, and is centered around one guitar riff. I\r\nreally enjoy this song, and I think it's an excellent way to end this album.<p><B>Conclusion:</B><p>Frequency is a really good album by IQ with some classic moments. I do think it is one of IQ's\r\nweaker efforts with Nicholls, but this is still a very good album. I'm on the fence between giving\r\nthis a 3 and a 4 star rating, and in a perfect world I would give this a 3.5. Since Frequency really\r\nis a great album that I've been enjoying lately, I'm going to round my rating up to a four.<p>4 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=252405#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=252405\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=252405\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, November 23, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #252405)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11631\"><strong>Windhawk</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11631\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11631/lpvet2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n27 years after their debut album UK veterans IQ show that they are still a band with the\r\ncapabilities to create solid albums. And while they aren't exactly covering new grounds here, the\r\nterritories covered are done so in an excellent manner.<p>Symphonic prog of the atmospheric variety is the name of the game here, with warm, rich multiple\r\nlayeres of keys and synths as a key feature. From the piano via organ and mellotron to what I\r\nsuspect are modern synths, the dreamy, rich tapestries produced by the variety of tangents are\r\nutilized in a manner few others are able to. The sound is full of life in a way few others are able\r\nto replicate. And with the other strong aspect of this band's output, the distinct emotional yet\r\nslightly detached lead vocals, these two dominating aspects conjure up distinct and strong moods\r\nbetween them.<p>Whether utilized in darker sounding themes or lighter ventures, supported by crunchy guitars or\r\nwandering light guitar licks, it's these two elements that carry this venture. And while the truly\r\nstuning and superior efforts may not be around this time - the ballad Life Support actually being\r\nclosest to this as far as I'm concerned - this is a strong album nontheless, and one that will be\r\nappreciated by fans of this act as well as followers of Neo-Progressive rock in general. Rock solid\r\nfrom start to finish, but no diamonds this time around.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=255347#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=255347\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=255347\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, December 9, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #255347)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25408\"><strong>TheGazzardian</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25408\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25408/DruidDogGreen.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI've been putting off reviewing this one for some time. Although I've listened to it many times, and in fact \r\nenjoyed it, I've been hard pressed to find a rating for this album that felt fair to me, so I've been listening \r\nto it again in the hopes of feeling some sort of certainty about what rating it deserves.<p>The music on this album is quite good. It is your typical prog line-up of keys, guitar, bass, singer, \r\ndrums. Nothing about these guys is really new to the prog scene; this type of neo/symphonic prog has \r\nexisted for decades. But IQ has been doing it for decades themselves, and are quite good at it. They \r\ndeftly move from quieter tracks to tracks that rock harder, from acoustic guitars to electric. The music \r\nflows together quite nicely from song to song on the album, and \"Closer\" closes the album quite nicely. <p>I am still on the edge about Peter Nicholls voice. On initial listening, it always seems to be the weak \r\npoint of this band, yet it never feels out of place. If I had to describe his vocal delivery, it would be very \r\ndeliberate, and a little harsh. Of the IQ albums I have heard so far, his voice sounds the smoothest on \r\nthis one. It has less of the harshness that he has had on previous albums, and I have to admit that it \r\nmakes his voice sound more appealing to my ears, especially during the softer parts of the album. Yet \r\nthe abrasive-ness of his voice had it's charm; I can't imagine listening to 'Harvest of Souls' (off of Dark \r\nMatter) without it, for it is part of the music. Luckily, his voice still works with the more aggressive bits on \r\nthis album.<p>I can't comment too much on the transition from Martin Orford on keys to Mark Westworth, for I haven't \r\nheard a lot of IQ's older stuff yet. It doesn't seem to have done the band any damage, the songwriting \r\non this album is as good as it was on anything else I've heard by them. If anything, I would say that \r\nMark has helped IQ gain a stronger identity, for I hear a bit less Genesis in them than I did previously. <p>The album has few high points (the opening and closing of the title track, the chorus of Ryker skies, \r\netc.), but other than that it is actually remarkably even. There aren't any low points at all, really. I think \r\nthat's what makes this album so hard to judge. While it is definitely an enjoyable listen, there's really \r\nnothing exciting about it to expound upon, nor anything dragging it down to complain about. For that \r\nreason, I give it a three star rating.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=258168#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=258168\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=258168\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, December 27, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #258168)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23504\"><strong>Marty McFly</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23504\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23504/owl.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSadly,  I can't compare, as I know just this album, so don't expect wonders here. You never do you say ? Great, we understand \r\neach other then.<p>As whole, 62 minute long musical piece (this music sounds quite consistent to me), it's quite pleasant and uplifting album, even \r\nsome parts are this dark \"happy\" mood, sometimes wandering into unintentional optimistic state (last song), where these waves \r\nof joy can be almost too much. Yes, it's not so big issue, there are others (Moon Safari's Blomljud), where whole music is based \r\non this, but that's the point, it is based. Here, I frankly don't know what intention of this album is, but am trying to enjoy it. And it's \r\npossible, easily. But to think of it as a masterpiece, I would need more.<p>4(+), seems like IQ (from what others are saying) are still \"in the mood\", making good albums. Something like Pendragon, right ? \r\nBut done differently a little bit (even not so different).<p>I sense overly present try of IQ to make something interesting \"again\" (I suppose), something that won't fade away, almost \r\nconvulsively to be honest. It's not so relaxed album as I would like it to be, but its qualities are here, we all who owns this CD can \r\nhear them, but I don't feel like someone without doubts. Something is not wrong, but because it's not big issue and I don't know \r\nwhat it is, I'll leave it to be and will be fair.<p>One thing is for sure. Every time I hear this album, I'm expecting nice experience and I get it.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=262848#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=262848\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=262848\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, January 27, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #262848)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> \"The first atomic bomb was dropped on a military base called Hiroshima....\" </strong><p>\"Frequency\" begins with a voice over speaking of a nuclear assault. The intro is \r\nunbelievable! The impressive music is beautifully executed, Mike Holmes' clean soaring \r\nguitars, chugging riffs like Led Zeppelin, ambient sustained mellotron and keyboard pads \r\nby Mark Westworth, with expressive, creative drumming from Andy Edwards, the bass by \r\nJohn Jowitt is played virtuoso style as well. The vocals of Peter Nicholls are clean, inviting \r\nand uplifting, sounding somewhat like Neal Morse at times. \"Frequency\" is an incredible \r\nfollowup to 2004's \"Dark Matter\". This is marginally the better album of the two, \r\nthough \"Dark Matter\" was certainly a very good album. There is more innovation and \r\nstronger compositions on this conceptual work. Due to the strong melodies throughout this \r\nalbum it is a genuine grower, and you are likely to love each track the more you listen to it, \r\nnothing on it is a throwaway or filler, it is all solid prog at its best. I heard it three times in a \r\nrow and eventually succumbed to the fact that this, as far as I am concerned, is one of the \r\nmost uplifting prog albums of recent years and I rate it as a masterpiece of neo prog. <p>\r\n<strong> Frequency</strong> is one of the best IQ numbers, with solid time signature changes and a \r\npositive sound with special effects and melancholy keyboards. Mike Holmes' guitar riffs are \r\ndynamic and the lead breaks are emotive and Pink Floydian. Nicholls' warm vocals spell \r\nout the main themes of the album: <em>\"Before I was undiscovered, When I was invincible, \r\nNobody could kill the silence And probably no one will again, The future was unrelated, \r\nAlternatives all pursued, The lives that got separated When others were split in two.\" </em> It \r\nis a brilliant composition and unforgettable. <p>\r\n<strong> Life Support</strong> begins with beautiful piano and sustained pads and then those warm \r\nemotional vocals chime in. This is so uplifting, and reminiscent of Transatlantic. The lyrics \r\nare reflecting on life's trials and how to overcome. The mood changes as a thunderous \r\nsound is heard and it builds to a crescendo then a lead guitar swoops over as drums keep \r\na steady metrical pattern. Westworth's spacey synth is alienating and futuristic, similar to \r\nthe type heard in electronic music. It is a lengthy instrumental and as good as it gets. The \r\nsynths merge with majestic guitar leads. A very melodic motif repeats in various forms and \r\nlocks into your head. It is absolute bliss when the band are in full flight. The wind effects are \r\nairy, ethereal and haunting towards the end. I adored this track the first time I heard it and it \r\ngets better with each listen.<p>\r\n<strong> Stronger than Friction</strong>, an ironic take on Stranger Than Fiction, begins with a \r\nmelodic guitar riff, and the positive vocals of Nicholls harmonise about ways of living \r\n<em> \"until our worlds collide\" </em>. At 3:50 the heavy beat halts and an ambient mellotron \r\nsoaked pad sizzles along as the vocals become softer and the whole song becomes a \r\n<em> \"turning tide\" </em>.  I like the fast riff at 6:40 where the time sig changes completely again \r\nand the vocals are more aggressive. The sporadic bass and drums are off kilter and there \r\nis a lilting keyboard and ascending lead guitar break. One of the true highlights of the \r\nalbum and in fact the first 3 tracks are prime example of Neo Prog at its best.<p>\r\n<strong>One Fatal Mistake</strong> is a melancholic ballad, a gentle soothing sound that warms \r\nyou up. The lyrics are encouraging and lift up the spirits; <em> \"Imagine all you could have \r\nbeen, Eventually you would have seen, The wanderlust, And all you dared to dream of, If \r\never you make one fatal mistake, You broke me, you have no idea, In darkness I see more \r\nthan hear, Impossible, even I can say, Many would have walked away.\" </em> There is always \r\na ray of hope injected in to the lyrics that talk of how to overcome despair and difficult \r\ncircumstances. The melody is very pleasant to the ears and musically there is a lot on offer \r\nhere especially the transfixing guitars and keyboards. <p>\r\n<strong>Ryker Skies</strong> features thick buzzsaw synth and flowing acoustics. I first heard this on \r\na Prognosis CD from the Prog magazine and it stood out as much as it does here. Once \r\nagain the atmosphere is ambient textures of melancholy reflection. The lyrics are emotive, \r\n<em> \"I'm reeling, fighting for breath, Running on empty, A fortress carved out of steel, Black \r\nand surrounding, No other survivors, the walls without end, So where have I come to?\" </em> \r\nA very strong bass and drum beat with crashing cymbals kicks in. The lead break is replete \r\nwith bends and pitched picking. The next section of vocals sound like Ayreon's deep robotic \r\neffect voices on \"Universal Migrator\"; <em> \"Welcome, hero, to Ryker Skies, Where all your \r\nhopes are stored, You can leave responsibilities in ruins at the door\". </em> The mellotron is \r\never present as the cleaner vocals of Nicholls take over with high octaves; a very nice \r\nsound and killer melody as the song swings in to full gear, <em> \"Get it knocked into your \r\nthick skull, It's really not that hard It's a cast iron binding covenant And this is just the start, \r\nThere are insults and injuries, You've heaped upon yourself, But you play the victim, While \r\nyou pile the blame on someone else\". </em>This track has some of the most memorable \r\nlyrics of IQ and the chorus, once it gets in your head, well you will never forget that melody, \r\n<em> \"So before I state my intention to live or die, I command your total attention In Ryker \r\nSkies.\" </em> I love the way the track merges into a full blown keyboard attack. Once again a \r\nthrobbing beat ensues like the machinated pulses of Ayreon. The acoustic flourishes are a \r\nlovely touch, adding to the very airy atmosphere. I would rate this as a proposed single from \r\nthe album, as it is more commercial in sound, but this does not detract from the \r\nmusicianship which is excellent throughout. A wonderful song. <p>\r\n<strong> The Province</strong> is a 13 minute IQ romp with textures of light and dark, moments of \r\ntension and release are present and infectious melodic verses. The style at times is not \r\ndissimilar to the sound of Peter Gabriel's Genesis. There is a heavy guitar riff that \r\noverpowers the soundscape after a time. The staccato synthesizer chords are fantastic as \r\ntradeoffs with guitar. There is a lot of acoustic work but it is well balanced by the heavier \r\nsections.  There are many changes in tempo and mood and it progresses into minimalist \r\npiano and vocals at the end; <em> \"I cannot count the many ways cos' there's nothing real... \r\nbefore the wireless kills.\" </em>  <p>\r\n<strong>Closer</strong> is as far removed from the obscene industrial NIN song of the same name \r\nas you can get. It is a balladic song with positive vocals that are close to Neal Morse or \r\nSpock's Beard; <em> \"Slandered and betrayed, A character assassination, Watch the guilty \r\nfade, Now the work is done, Ghosts of early days, Gather round the later rivals, All parade \r\nupon the earth to which they're bound, Silent in their course, They steal across the icy \r\nstations, Words are useless now, They fall upon the ground.\" </em> The song builds \r\ngradually until we get a majestic instrumental break with soaring keyboards and then a \r\nbeautifully sung verse with powerful lyrics; <em> \"Hold on, when I'm dead and gone from you, \r\nRemember me as light breaking through, Stay strong, any time you feel you're lost, I will \r\ncarry you back across\". </em> The piano motif becomes hypnotic toward the end repeated as \r\nguitars and sporadic drums maintain a melancholy mood, closing the album in style.<p>\r\nOverall, \"Frequency\" is the best I have heard from IQ, melancholy, with moments of heavy \r\ntension, and those soaring powerful vocals: this is neo prog at a virtuoso level and I think \r\nit's one of the albums of 2009. Accessible and soaring vocally, atmospheric and ambient \r\nmusically. A masterful work of high quality musicianship.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=281745#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=281745\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=281745\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, May 13, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #281745)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15960\"><strong>CCVP</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15960\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15960/130464717833.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>An album that I have been frequently listening to</strong><p>Neo prog is the first <em>modern</em> progressive rock genre and, despite having a considerable amount\r\nof bands, I rarely am interested by the genre. It is not that i deslike it or anything, it is just\r\nthat most bands seem to go through that same old same old places: that same floydian keyboards and\r\norgan, same godawful Peter Gabriel impersonation, moody guitars, generic Genesis influences, etc,\r\nnot bringing anything really new to the table. That predictability obviously does not thrill me, so\r\nI usually steer far from it. <p>From time to time, however, the planets align and the cosmic starlight hits me, making me check some\r\nneo band or release, usually some known band or well received album to avoid excpected\r\ndissappointments. This album, therefore, should be a safe one to pick, since it is by one of the\r\nmain bands of neo prog and was generally well received. With that idea on my mind I got my copy of\r\nFrequency and had some real long and thoughtful listen on my 20 hour bus trip to Rio to see Dream\r\nTheater, on late 2009.<p>The veredic is clear: far from having the characteristic predictability of neo prog,  Frequency is\r\nan interesting, amusing and exciting output by IQ that hooked me for good.Obviously, just as the\r\napple can't fall far from the tree, IQ still has the characteristic genre sound. Frequency, however,\r\nhas some of the heaviest riffs I have ever seen on any neo band so far, riffs that can be even\r\ncalled as <em>heavy metal</em> riffs. The heaviness, though not being necessarily a good thing, sure\r\nis a breath of fresh air.<p>Music wise, all instruments are quite good: the moody atmosphere, the moogs and synthesizers, the\r\nexiteing guitars and basses, everything fits just right. The vocals are also very interesting, since\r\nPeter's vocals are very competent, fit exactly in the band's sound and are also quite different from\r\nwhat I expected. <p>In spite of all that, this album is far from being perfect. First, it is just too long. Some of the\r\nsongs could easily be out of the album without doing any damage, being the biggest example of that\r\nthe song One Fatal Mistake. Other songs could also be considerably shortened. <p>Another key problem of Frequency is that sometimes the band simply cannot keep up with the song's\r\nquality. The change they make around the mid of the first song, for example, is just terrible! It\r\nbegins so good and it develops to such an adorable and captivating atmosphere and then it is\r\nCOMPLETELY RUINED! This also happens  in other parts of the album, but they aren't as bad as in the\r\nfirst song.<p><em>Grade and Final Thoughts</em><p>Frequency had the potential to be a masterpiece. The album has so many great ideas and is presented\r\nso well! However, a series of small mistakes are eventually summed up and weight quite negatively.\r\nIt is, nevertheless, a great album and surely is something that most progheads can (and should)\r\nenjoy, thus 4 stars seem like the appropriate rating.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=297909#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=297909\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=297909\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, September 7, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #297909)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThough \"Ryker Skies\"(9:45) (10/10) is a great song--one of the best of the Naughties--Frequency as a whole displays nothing new except perfected, refined, even re-hashed IQ Neo-prog (which is, in itself, rehashed imitation of the melodic symphonic and crossover bands of the late 1970s). The album's much-raved-about prog epic, \"The Province of the King\"(13:42) (7/10) is familiar, textbook GENESIS/IQ. Too bad that Peter Nicholls' rather pleasant voice is always the same.

I've been a fan in the Fish's times but  \r\nI have to recognize that IQ are really better. Maybe they are more mature on this album released \r\nin 2009 than Rothery & co in the early 80s, but the songs in this album are stronger and of \r\ncourse more original. Nicholls doesn't try to sing like Peter Gabriel as Fish was doing and they \r\ndon't write two-chords songs with just odd signatures that's something to which Marillion \r\nindulged some times. \"Frequency\", the title track is quite a masterpiece of neo-prog (and not \r\nonly). In a period of my life in which I'm listening to more unstructured things this is one of the \r\nfew melodic albums which I listen to repetitively. The piano intro of \"Life Support\" is great and \r\nintroduces another fantastic song. Nicholls has a clean and powerful voice that walks well on \r\nthe square waves of the piano and keyboard carpet. <p>The only defect of this album is that the best things are at the beginning, so even if the overall \r\nquality is very good throughout all the album it looses something on the way. The most melodic \r\nmoments, like \"One Fatal Mistake\" and the long \"The Province\" are better than the uptime \r\nsongs like Ryker Skies. <p>In few words this is an album good for every taste, also mainstream, without being \r\ncommercial. I'm curious to listen to the previous releases of this band, but I'm wondering \r\nwhere was I when this band, contemporary to Marillion, was releasing albums of this kind? \r\nHow can I have missed them for so long? From an old Marillion fan, they appear to be better, at \r\nleast in this album.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=413244#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=413244\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=413244\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, March 9, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #413244)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=29363\"><strong>Andy Webb</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=29363\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/29363/astr&#111;naut.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe first sonic bomb was dropped on my ears, unsuspectingly.<p>Neo-prog is the prog genre that's heyday was the 80s yet the best has come out recently. In \r\ndescription, it seems to circular: \"what's Marillion? Neo-prog. What's neo prog? Stuff that \r\nsounds like Marillion.\" There really is no set definition, other that post-symphonic prog rock, \r\nwhich can be a rather general term. IQ, a definitive band of the genre, have been carving \r\ntheir own path in the genre since the early 80s, and can still whip out a killer album. \r\nFrequency is their ninth effort, and is certainly one of their better albums, even compared to \r\nthe 80s heaven for neo. Filled to the brim with infectious melodies, fantastic instrumental \r\nparts, and superb compositions, the album is certainly a definitive IQ release and a definite \r\nneo-progressive rock album.<p>The title track opens the album with a series of sound bits, before breaking into a hard \r\nhitting rock riff session with some great guitar/keys contrasts and some superb rhythmic \r\nwork. Early on you can see the style of IQ, with a more cut and dry hard rock/prog approach \r\nrather than some neo bands with their more \"luscious\" approach to symphonic rock. The \r\namazing breakdowns with electric piano and other synth and guitar effects is purely \r\nsublime, and the vocal melodies only add to the ecstasy. The lyrics are no bummer either, \r\nfitting the melodies perfectly and accenting the music in the most beautiful way.  The \r\ntransition back to the harder instrumental section is flawless, with dynamics being thrown \r\naround with intense precision and skill. The track is certainly a classic, and it's only the first \r\ntrack.<p>Life Support opens with a nice piano melody, backed by some guitar and synth \r\natmospheres. The vocals on this track are more popularly accessible, but still have a \r\nsuperb mellow quality; the music has a truly sublime quality to it, making this for another \r\nsuperb track on this album. The song takes a nice dollop of time to build into a scanning \r\nand almost creepy feeling guitar track, with some superb melodic support from the synths \r\nand other effects. Again the rhythm section is spot on, combining precision bass lines with \r\npolyrhythmic drumming. The whole instrumental work of the band is fantastic, adding more \r\nclassic lines to the album.<p>Stronger than Friction starts off with a great sweeping guitar melody, backed by some nice \r\nsynth-strings effects. Again the track employs some really fantastic melodies to support it \r\nmusically. Also employing some more superb lyrics, the track is overall really superb. In a \r\nsimilar fashion to the previous two tracks, a superb use of keyboard layers and guitar \r\nmelodies and rhythmic precision accent the music. Sweeping sections of grandeur \r\ncompliment numerous parts of the song, again making this a really great track. <p>One Fatal Mistake starts off with a jovial sounding acoustic/synth duo, which are \r\naccentuated by pleasant vocal melodies and nice harmonization between the parts. The \r\nlyrics again are really great. Most of the song keeps this feel of a really great poppy/prog \r\ncrossover track, with the melodies the main contributor to its prowess. Overall the song isn't \r\nthe best on the album, but certainly contributes some really superb melodies harmonies.<p>Ryker Skies breaks from the jovial nature of One Fatal Mistake to a return to the melancholy \r\nguitar and vocal melodies found on most of the album. Starting out slow, it builds slowly into \r\na rocking IQ track, with some more really fantastic riffs and harmonies between the guitar \r\nsoloing and the synth growling. The drum and bass beats are simpler here, but contain a \r\nreal punch to contend with. The song really packs a punch, with the hard hitting rhythms \r\naccenting the soaring guitar atmospheres fantastically. The vocal melodies really bloom \r\ninto beautiful harmonies, bringing out the great qualities of the instrumentation and really \r\nmeshing nicely with the atmosphere of the music. Overall, the song is one of my favorites, \r\nand a really fantastic addition to this star-studded album. <p>The Province again starts out with mellow and melancholy melodies, this time with a hint of \r\nhorror in the guitar and synth duo. But once the song really gets started, you can begin to \r\nsee the genius of this 13 minute masterpiece. Building into a ripping rocking section, the \r\nsong weaves in and out of dynamics, with transitions between rocking sections and quiet \r\nmelodic sections. The song takes a while to stabilize, but once it does, the constant rocking \r\nfeel of the song doesn't abate. With some killer synth arpeggios accenting the on-off \r\npolyrhythmic guitar crunches and drum rhythms, the song is killer. We see some reprise to \r\nprevious themes of the album, adding a nice feeling of continuity to the album. Overall, the \r\nlongest track of the album really packs a hefty dose of progressive rock mastery, with some \r\nkiller instrumental sections and incredible vocal sections, and an overall sublime \r\nexperience.<p>Closer closes the album with some more jovial melodies, breaking out the drying out \r\nformula of guitar/synth/vocal melody intro, but still instills a great sense of continuity \r\nbetween each track on the album. The song slowly builds into a nice poppy track, with some \r\ngreat melodies and care-filled instrumentation. The song acts as a really great closer, tying \r\nin a lot of the stray themes of the album in the track and closing the concept of the album. \r\nOverall, it is one of the happier songs on the album, and a superb closer to the album as \r\nwell.<p>ALBUM OVERALL: IQ have always been widely considered a pioneer and essential piece of \r\nthe neo-prog scene, yet they have never truly been rated very highly. With their latest album, \r\n5 years after the supposedly critically acclaimed Dark Matter (which is currently less than 4 \r\nstars on PA), I believe that the streak of great but not fantastic neo is over. Frequency is filled \r\nto the brim with beautiful compositions. Sublime melodies run amuck, and instrumental \r\nintegrity is solid as a rock. Overall, the album proffers one of the best neo albums I've ever \r\nencountered, and is no doubt a pure masterpiece. I am definitively hopeful of a new album \r\nsoon! 5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=434428#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=434428\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=434428\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 16, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #434428)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23131\"><strong>Isa</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23131\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23131/220px-JohnDunsScotus_-_full.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n|C| One of the stronger releases of modern Neo-prog.<p>As this is my first review of a Neo-prog album, I might start off with a word of my general low \r\nopinion of Neo-prog in general. I pretty much consider the genre the 80s prog that \r\nsomehow never died out, but neither did it develop much over the years. It's basically the \r\npop of the prog community, with cliches that the fan-base can eat up, often with no real \r\nsubstance or creativity of which to be spoken. \"You've heard one band, you heard them all\" \r\nis a good indication my views of the style, and it would be an understatement to say that \r\nthere is little diversity in the use of devices of composition in the genre from band to band. \r\nHowever, some bands definitely pull off the style very effectively, sometimes very charmingly, \r\nand on rare occasion, beautifully.<p>I've sampled a few IQ albums before, but never before dedicated a concentrated analysis of \r\nan album. I decided to pick Frequency since it's their most recent album and simultaneously one of their most highly rated, which isn't often the case older prog bands \r\nthe past few years. While I find it by no means groundbreaking, breathtaking or essential, it \r\nsure is a nice change of pace from my usual music consumption, and was pleasantly surprised that I didn't want to throw up from the Neo-prog cliches, let alone actually enjoy it. \r\nLet it be known to the reader that a three is quite a compliment from his reviewer: its means \r\nthat I think it's good, as in actually worth buying.<p>The instrumentation and layering of the composition is basically what you can expect from \r\nmost Neo-prog: chorused guitars, synthesizers and effects everywhere, melodic guitar lines \r\nsometimes with atmospheric reverse-fade effects, etc. However, I find that IQ utilizes the \r\ntypical layering formulas in often creative and expressive ways, and deviate from the cliches \r\njust enough to give their music the creative edge that is lacking in most neo-prog. And \r\nsometimes, they just plain rock (pun intended). I especially like the drummer, he almost \r\nalways contributes a lot to the intrigue of the music. While much of their work may be laced \r\n(and often, too much so) with effects, the actual composition beneath is of pretty good \r\nquality, whilst many current prog releases often use the effects the cover up for lack of \r\nsubstantial, musical ideas (I give an example with a very recent review of mine).<p>Track Commentary: The opening album title track starts off with recorded sounds about \r\nHiroshima distorted with effects, leading into mellotron pads with heavy palm-muted guitar \r\nthat repeats several times, coming to be layered with a guitar solo, and then some nice \r\nkeyboard synth riffing. Nicely done, though the rhythm guitar part is a bit repetitive for my \r\ntaste. This leads to an electric keyboard section that repeats every two measures. The \r\nsinger is quite nice sounding, as are the reverse-fade electric guitar parts. This song has \r\nsome decent chord progressions. The 7/8 section is a bit choppy sounding, but I wonder if \r\nthis was a conscious decision. I like the way the intro comes back at the end with the \r\nvocalist singing this time, with pretty tasteful effects on his voice in my opinion. Probably one \r\nof the best tracks on the album. The second track Life Support is starts off with soft piano \r\narpeggios. I don't usually like music of this kind, somewhat sentimental sounding and \r\ncliche, but IQ pulls it off in a way that's very classy and convincing, and I actually \r\nunexpectedly enjoy this track. The section with the synthesizer is also quite nice, albeit \r\nsomewhat synthetic sounding, but I think that's kind of the point of this album in general to \r\nan extent. This track demonstrates some efficient use of effects in my view, especially at the \r\nend. I wish the middle section weren't repeated so much though (which is more excusable \r\nconsidering the solid drum solo beneath the repeated sections). Stronger Than Fiction \r\nstarts off abruptly with the main melodic guitar line, very energetic. This track is in general \r\nquite jagged, with pretty good material in each section of the song, but I feel like they don't \r\nreally link too well. The verse has your (very) typical way of layering neo-prog, though it does \r\nhave a bit of a groove to it. The chorus unfortunately seems a bit out of place with the \r\nsudden heavy guitar out of nowhere. This track leads directly into the softer One Fatal \r\nMistake, which once again is more sentimental sounding than my usual taste but it's \r\nnonetheless well done. The sound effects at the end lead into Ryker Skies, which starts off \r\nwith chorused acoustic guitar chords, very pretty sounding ones at that. Then, seemingly out \r\nof nowhere drops the guitar bass and drums playing a heavier section. Then this breaks \r\ninto synthesizer/keyboard effects section with the vocal line dubbed an octave lower, kind of \r\ncreative for them to do that. The chorus sounds way to drawn out though, and this work \r\nseems quite long-winded in general. I like the mallet percussion toward the end of the \r\nsong, but that damn bass synth pounding out rhythms really ruins the soft movement \r\nimplied by the other instruments. The fade out was kind of weird. The Province, the longest \r\nand most substantial work on the album, has a lot of elegant acoustic guitar work and tasty \r\nchord progressions. I like the transitions into the heavier sections, especially at \"not here, \r\nnot now!\" Very expressive. There's lots of diversity in this song, with chord progressions, \r\neffects, melodies, layering, etc. Closer starts off with very heavy effects on clean guitar \r\narpeggios, layered with synth pads and a nice vocal melody. I like the way the acoustic \r\nguitar and piano are added after the vocals finish.<p>This is definitely one of the better releases from the genre of Neo-prog in general; not the \r\nbest that I've heard, but this really is a pretty pleasant album that doesn't pretentiously try to \r\nmake too much of itself. The musicians really take their time (usually too much time) to say \r\nwhat they need to say, and say it in a elegant and gentle matter. In fact, the main issues that \r\nthis album suffers from are mainly a factor of long-windedness in most of the tracks, and \r\nthe sometimes unsatisfactory transitions between sections of the songs, which is really \r\nwhat usually separates the men from the boys among the great artists of rock music. Not to \r\nmention the general over-repetition of some musical ideas, but this is an almost universal \r\nproblem for Neo-prog anyway. This is definitely an album to revisit on occasion. I \r\nrecommend it for Neo-prog fans, and consider it essential for IQ fans for sure.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=727648#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=727648\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=727648\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 14, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #727648)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe departure of Paul Cook and Martin Orford from IQ brought to an end one of the longest-\r\nlasting lineups in the band's history - a lineup responsible for the band's incredible streak of \r\nsuperior neo-prog albums from Ever to Dark Matter. Luckily, any doubts about Mark \r\nWestworth's ability to step into Martin Orford's stool or Andy Edwards' credentials on the \r\ndrumstools are shattered by this incredible album, which finds the band as a whole on top \r\nform.<p>The compositions give plenty of chances for the new boys to show what they can do (Ryker \r\nSkies must count as a real triumph, with Peter Nicholls intoning his megalomaniac lyrics over \r\nWestworth and Edwards' interplay), whilst of course the old hands turn in excellent \r\nperformances in their own right. IQ's lineup changes usually result in a shaking-up of the \r\nband's sound, and this time is no different - but this time it's for the better, the band finding a \r\nbeneficial balance between freshening their sound on the one hand and keeping things proggy \r\non the other. In fact, this album is at once one of the band's more accessible releases and yet, \r\nat the same time, is also one of their most original works, with all sorts of hidden complexities.<p>Looking back, I see I haven't given an IQ studio album less than five stars since Ever (unless \r\nyou count Seven Stories Into 98, which was a quickie recording of an old demo, or the odds \r\nand sods collection The Lost Attic). That might be a little fannish, though I would argue it \r\nspeaks more to the incredible consistency of the band than anything else. Frequency is a \r\nparticularly important achievement for the band because it shows that they can survive even as \r\nradical a change in lineup as the loss of their co-founder, and still produce prog gems of the \r\nquality we've come to expect from them.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=734616#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=734616\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=734616\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 21, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #734616)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12334\"><strong>b_olariu</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12334\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12334/4927969.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nactualy 3.5 stars<p>The newest to date IQ album released in 2009 and named Frequency is another worthy neo prog album\r\nfrom their catalogue. IQ being one of my fav neo prog bands for many years knowing almost all their\r\nalbums and reviewing aswell some of them, I've decided to re check this release in proper manner.\r\nSteping out from the IQ helm well known and respected musicians Martin Orford and Paul Cook who\r\ncontribute a lot to the revigoration and re establish the neo prog genre in last almost 30 years\r\nthey were  replaced by Mark Westworth and Andy Edwards. To me this album sounds little darker then\r\nprevious works maybe due to the fact of these two new musicians but aswell the band is again in top\r\nform like it was in last 20 years. A solid album with top performance , just to be checked the first\r\ntwo pieces, the title track and Life Support  what a strong and imaginative passages here, strong\r\nrhythmic section and excellent ideas overall. Ryker Skies is another highlight with Nicholls\r\ndelivering some great vocal moments from melacholical passages to a more refined ones, each time he\r\nreally shines. The musicianship is again great, overall no weak moments, but I don't think this is\r\ntheir best album, I count Ever, The wake, Dark matter or Seventh house to be more intresting and\r\nmore balanced then Frequency, but never the less this album comes very close behind. I loive Iq\r\nmusic for almost 20 years with each release they show maturity and above all complex and inventive\r\narrangements, that why they are considered one of the pioneers of the genre and among the most\r\nrespected band from neo prog zone. A good towards great album but not groundbreaking like\r\naforementioned previous albums.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=755967#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=755967\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=755967\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 21, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #755967)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=40189\"><strong>FragileKings</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=40189\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/40189/marble.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"Frequency\" is the most recent release by neo-proggers, IQ, and the first of their albums to \r\njoin the ranks of my CD collection. It was one of the purchases I made during what clearly \r\nbecame a record-setting year for me in CD purchases and music exploration, largely due to \r\nthe influence of this very site. Now, as a person who desperately needs to diet, I have put \r\nmyself under a strict CD purchasing regime that I intend to adhere to lest the wife find out \r\nand confiscate the bank book and seize my earnings. But on with the album review.<p><p>It opens with \"Frequency\" and within the first couple of minutes the stage is set for what \r\npromises to be a very good album. There's a great instrumental intro with Mellotrone, \r\nsynthesizer atmospherics, and heavy guitar. A recorded news report speaks about the first \r\natomic bomb drop: \"The first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base\". I \r\nwonder at the irony of the reporter trying to justify the dropping of an atomic bomb by saying \r\nthat Hiroshima was a military base, as if people should feel better not knowing about the \r\nhundreds of thousands of civilian deaths and casualties. Did IQ pick up on this? The mood \r\ngoes gentle with electric piano as the vocals begin, but the heaviness returns later. The \r\nvocals are smooth and very pleasing. There are some great keyboard sections and the \r\ndrumming intense. The song maintains an odd beat that is very hard to tap your foot to. \r\nOverall, this song is already the first stand out track from the album. But more's to come.<p><p>\"Life Support\" is slow and gentle with nice piano and synthesizer. It's not too long but good \r\nmusic. You'll notice drummer Andy Edwards cannot be content maintaining a plain beat. He \r\nkeeps breaking out in shuffling fills in spite of the song's slow tempo.<p><p>\"Stronger than Friction\" is a multipart song that changes pace and mood. There are gentle \r\nparts and aggressive parts. The band makes good use of their instruments and sounds \r\nand styles. The drumming again is remarkable. Fills, eruptions, quick shuffles. Like a drum \r\nsolo put to a song.<p><p>\"One Fatal Mistake\" actually begins as \"Friction\" fades out but the track change occurs when \r\nFriction has completely faded. Slow acoustic guitar, piano, and synth. Very pretty. It's a \r\nrelatively short song that segues into \"Ryker Skies\" with aethereal synth and a synth choir. \r\nClean electric guitar joins. There is a lot of praise for this song by some but good as it is, I \r\nalways lose concentration while this plays. It still is good as I listen to it now, making notes \r\nfor my review. Nice organ, electronic effects, heavy beat. Some outstanding moments. On \r\nthe strength of this song I would have bought the album, even though it is the least \r\nmemorable for me.<p><p>\"The Province\" is quite likely the highlight of the album and the longest track at over 13 \r\nminutes, though I find it difficult to declare it the highlight with so much good music \r\nelsewhere on the album. There's an acoustic beginning that evolves into a great epic with \r\nmany changes in tempo and mood. Intense heavy parts with Hammond organ offset the \r\nacoustic sections. It could be my favourite track though others are also really enjoyable to \r\nme.<p><p>The album's closer is \"Closer\" (as in I am now closer to buying another IQ album than I ever \r\nwas). It's sweet sentimental music. Very pretty. The song goes through some changes \r\nwhile keeping the mood. One the wife might appreciate. It's a bit like \"One Fatal Mistake\" but \r\nstill different. Very powerful music and vocals. The drumming here is often swift and exciting \r\nas the song draws closer to its conclusion. Andy Edwards must have hot coals under his \r\nseat.<p><p>I really like this album. The three stand-out features for me are the music compositions and \r\nuse of guitars and keyboards in general, Peter Nicholls' wonderful vocals, and Andy \r\nEdwards' ants-in-the-pants drumming. I have already lined up three more IQ albums for \r\npurchase this year. If I want more than that I will have to cut some other ones off my 2013 \r\nlist. I am glad to see the high rating for this album. One of my top ten purchases of 2012! \r\nNot quite five stars but I am glad if other people give it a full rating. I would be happy with a \r\n4.5 rating honestly.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=897797#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=897797\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=897797\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, January 23, 2013</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #897797)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11816\"><strong>Modrigue</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11816\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11816/PA-Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>IQ's best album of the 2000's</strong><p>It's a pity one of IQ's worst cover art is on one of their best records. Not frequently cited, this\r\ntenth studio album is quite inspired and modern, while preserving the band's musical identity. The\r\nmusicians real entered the new millennium this time. Maybe a little less adventurous than\r\npreviously, the songs are however more coherent, incorporates elements of other progressive styles\r\nsuch as heavy prog or prog metal, and the quality is present.<p>The heavy title track contains all what you can expect from IQ at the beginning of the 21st century:\r\na dark opening, rocky passages, enchanting trademark keyboards, pretty melodies and powerful soli.\r\nSimply one the best compositions from the band! \"Life Support\" can be divided in two parts. The\r\nmelancholic first half is dominated by piano-driven, whereas the second half displays unreal eerie\r\nmusic typical if IQ. The progressive \"Stronger Than Friction\" is also good, alternating dark, smooth\r\nand epic atmospheres. Ironically, the romantic ballad \"One Fatal Mistake\" is rather soapy and out of\r\nplace. Fortunately, this song is also the shortest. Therefore, this little mistake is far from being\r\nfatal for the disc.<p>Serious business comes back with the GENESIS-influenced \"Ryker Skies\", however darker and more\r\nmodern. Another nice composition in the style of the band, with a good progression, futuristic beat\r\nand a spacey passage. \"The Province\" is the longest track of the record. It first starts with\r\nbeautiful delicate guitars to then surprising become more ferocious and heavy. I bet you were not\r\nexpecting that. The contrast is striking, and the dream is turning into a nightmare! Really\r\nefficient. Unfortunately, this nearly flawless hour of music concludes with the insipid and\r\nrepetitive \"Closer\". The dark side of neo-prog...<p>Containing only two weak tracks, more convincing and personal than its predecessor, \"Dark Matter\", \"Frequency\" finally shows the musicians modernizing their style while preserving their soul and composition quality. Melancholic and somber, smooth and oppressive, nonetheless recommended to IQ fans, this opus is one of the best neo-progressive albums of the 21st century! Also adapted to discover the band if you're not familiar with this genre.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1566496#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1566496\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1566496\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, May 17, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1566496)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5589\"><strong>The Crow</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5589\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5589/diesiraebox_sheetmusic041.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFrequency is another gem from the most consistent Neo-Prog band Ever!!!<p>And this time IQ had to face some serious setbacks before the recording of this album, being the most serious one the \r\nloss of their co-founder and longtime keyboardist Martin Orford. I am sure that than affected this record, because \r\ndespite the keyboards are pretty good, the typical Orford sound is missed. He contributed to the composition of all \r\nthe tracks, and not having here in the record is rather strange. <p>Nevertheless, the band managed to get going and they recorded another solid album full of impressive moments and \r\ngreat passages. It is also a transition album in my opinion, because acts as a link of the old sound of the band, which \r\nended with the also excellent Dark Matter, and the more modern, dark and compelling tones of the masterpiece Road \r\nof Bones. <p>So maybe this album is not the best from IQ. However, even being an average record for IQ, it is still better than the \r\nmajority of prog records of 2009. <p>Best Tracks: Stronger than Friction (the most classic IQ-sounding track of the album), One Fatal Mistake (very touching \r\nlyrics), The Province of the King (the most impressive track of the album, instrumentally speaking) and Closer (I just \r\nlove this song, especially the acoustic guitars)<p>Conclusion: Frequency is a transition album. It was recorded in a convoluted era for the band being the only album \r\nwhere the former keyboardist Mark Westworth and drummer Andy Edwards participated. It was also the last album \r\nwith John Jowitt on board, and it contained music from Martin Orford after his departure of the band. <p>Nevertheless, the quality of the music is still very high and despite it is a weaker album than Dark Matter in my \r\nopinion, Frequency is another excellent IQ release and it gave us a glimpse of a very interesting new direction, which \r\nended in the incredible Road of Bones.  <p>My rating: ****</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2084397#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2084397\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2084397\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, December 8, 2018</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2084397)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ waited five long years to follow up their monstrous neo-prog classic \"Dark Matter\" but finally in 2009 their tenth studio arrived in \r\nthe form of FREQUENCY. There had been many shake ups for the band over the previous five years with the most significant coming \r\nin the form of the retirement of co-founder and keyboardist Martin Orford who would not only leave the band but would leave the \r\nmusic business altogether. His replacement was found in Mark Westworth formerly of Darwin's Radio and Grey Lady Down. If that \r\nwasn't enough, long time drummer Paul Cook also jumped ship after more than twenty years of service. His replacement was found \r\nin Andy Edwards formerly of Frost*, Flash Range and soon to be in Magenta. <p>While it seems that IQ must've taken a major hit from all the turbulence in the lineup, at this point the band had been cranking out \r\ntheir own unique product for so long that the members carried on without missing a beat. In fact, if anything, FREQUENCY \r\ndemonstrates perfectly that the adding of new blood is exactly what a band needs from time to time to keep from becoming \r\nstagnant. Not that IQ were in danger of doing just that but FREQUENCY definitely has elements of musicianship that differ from the \r\nprevious albums although they blend in seamlessly to the overarching neo-prog style that IQ had crafted over its 30 year history. \r\nWhile IQ has remained quite popular in cult prog circles, they have still flown under the radar of mainstream rock but despite the \r\nstaunch loyalty of fans, they can smell a wipe out a mile away and FREQUENCY passed all the quality tests with flying colors.<p>FREQUENCY consists of a mere seven tracks that just clock in over the 62 minute mark and in their wake unleash some of the most \r\nprovocative tracks of the band's career. Once again, the band emphasizes the liberal use of keyboards. Certain keyboard sounds \r\nentertain the melodic deliveries while other provide the massive atmospheric backdrops that offering the sweeping sonic \r\npanoramic scope of the musical delivery. The band do not deviate significantly from their established formula and incorporate the \r\nusual guitar, bass and drum sounds to accompany the swarm of keyboard sounds that provides the majority of differing timbres. \r\nThe compositions are teased out into amazingly rich and emotional sprawlers that tackle the usual nebulous powerlessness we all \r\nexperience in controlling our own destinies through intricate storylines.<p>As with their other 21st century albums, IQ implement healthy doses of heavy rock to contrast the softer passages and the general \r\nformula of building up intricate melodies into thundering climaxes still provides the uncompromising formula that the band had \r\nbeen implementing since they got their feet on the ground again on 1993's \"Ever.\" And once again vocalist Peter Nicholls delivers a \r\nflawless performance where he handles the jumps from placid near whispers to operatic heights without missing a beat. He also \r\ntackles many of the backing vocals which add interesting layers of depth. If there's perhaps one track that stands out its \"Ryker \r\nSkies\" which finds an interesting mix of the usual lush sensual neo-prog passages but also finds a crushing bass groove and soaring \r\nguitar riffs but also has some really cool electronic segments that give IQ a new cyber-industrial sort of vibe. The near 14 minute \r\n\"The Province Of Kings\" is another jittery prog rocker that tackles both heavy rock and synthesized sophistication like no other track \r\nwith killer Who like keyboard dances.<p>IQ have been nothing but extraordinarily consistent for the majority of their career and FREQUENCY really just continues a stream \r\nof strong albums that doesn't suffer one iota from two new members finding themselves on board. In fact, Westworth is more than \r\ncapable of matching Orford's exquisite keyboard playing palette of a million sounds in a million different keys and for a band that \r\nrelies on the keyboardist above all others, it's quite the complement to say that Westworth successfully filled some pretty tall shoes \r\nand still managed to add his own personal touches to the mix. For the most part a perfect album but \"One Fatal Mistake\" and \r\n\"Closer\" are a bit too generic for my liking. Still yet one more excellent album to add to the IQ canon.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2087024#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2087024\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2087024\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, December 14, 2018</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2087024)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's 'Frequency' at first just sounded like another pleasant release by the band. A great production sound, some \r\nlonger tracks, and some great progressive moments that even evoke King Crimson. The album also has some \r\ndirect quotations of Genesis as usual. It was only after listening the album for months that I actually started to \r\nfamiliarize myself with it. The first song that stood out to me was 'Ryker Skies' with its imminent and dark sci-fi \r\natmospheres. It just hits you and the interludes are very effective as well. The opening track 'Frequency' is a great \r\nup-tempo track as well. Then the rest of the album grew on me. I don't always like the almost mandatory cheesy \r\nMarillion-type endings of IQ's albums, but the aptly titles 'Closer' is actually one of my favorite songs on this \r\nalbum. Great drums patterns on the main theme and a strong majestic middle section. The band introduces \r\nMark Westworth on keyboards here and he plays some fine keyboard solo's here. The guitar leads by Mike \r\nHolmes are particularly well recorded on this album, sometimes reminding me of the thick tone of Nick Barrett \r\nfrom Pendragon. After listening to it more often these days I can say this has become one of my favorite albums \r\nof the band. There isn't a single moment on it that interrupts its integrity or artistic finesse. Not at al challenging \r\nto listen to (like for instance 'Resistance'), this is by no means a special album in the band's discography. Yet, it is \r\nspecial to me. Can't wait for the first vinyl print that was announced this year (2020). </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2437304#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2437304\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2437304\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, August 14, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2437304)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=56081\"><strong>VianaProghead</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=56081\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/1/cover_404762112008.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" title=\"VianaProghead avatar\" width=100 alt=\"VianaProghead avatar\" onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n                                    Review N\u00ba 679<p>IQ has been at the forefront of prog rock music for more than forty years. Along with some other like minded \r\nBritish outfits, IQ picked up the torch and carried it proudly into the 80's and beyond, beginning with their \r\ncassette 'Seven Stories Into 98' of 1982 but only released in 1998. 'Frequency' is the ninth studio album of IQ \r\nand was released in 2009. A special edition with a bonus DVD, which is mine, was also released. This DVD \r\ncontains the complete recordings of the live performed on 1 December 2007 at the Boerderij in Zoetermeer, in \r\nHolland, which is a nice addition to the album.<p>'Frequency' is the first album from the group recorded with the two new band's members, Andy Edwards on \r\ndrums and Mark Westworth on keyboards. They substituted their two former band's members the drummer \r\nPaul Cook and the keyboardist Martin Orford. Both left the group at the same time. So, the line up of \r\n'Frequency' is Peter Nicholls (lead and backing vocals), Mike Holmes (guitars and keyboards), Mark Westworth \r\n(backing vocals and keyboards), John Jowitt (backing vocals and bass) and Andy Edwards (drums and percussion).<p>'Frequency' has seven tracks. All songs were written by IQ and all lyrics were written by Peter Nicholls. The first \r\ntrack is the title track 'Frequency'. It's an excellent and very interesting track where IQ also manages to join to \r\ntheir usual trademark sound an extra dose of energy and heaviness. This is really a track perfectly divided into \r\nthe antagonistic feelings, melody and aggression, old and new, which is clearly destined to become a classic IQ \r\nsong. The second track 'Life Support' features Westworth's piano and a beautiful vocal performance by Nicholls. \r\nSome subtle orchestrations and a tiny bit of guitar conclude well the first part of the song. The second part of \r\nthe song is for Holmes' guitar and Westworth's keyboards, very well supported by a delightful drumming by \r\nEdwards and a great bass line by Jowitt. The last final part of the song is a very ambient sounding piece of music. \r\nThis is another great track, indeed. The third track 'Stronger Than Fiction' represents the second great epic of \r\nthe album. This is a mid tempo song at the beginning with a melancholic singing and leading by Westworth. The \r\nsecond part of the song is more powerful and Nicholls' voice can be heard on both channels changing from left \r\nto right. The last part of the song is perfectly in the same vein of the best music that IQ could offer, carried of \r\ngreat keyboard sounds. The fourth track 'One Fatal Mistake' is the ballad on the album. The first part of the \r\nsong is compared with the second track of the album and in the second part the music contains some musical \r\nelements of ambient music as well as the first notes from the next track 'Ryker Skies'. This is in general \r\nconsidered the weakest song on the album, and there is may be some truth in that, indeed. However, this is a \r\nvery beautiful and lovely song and it's truly a pleasure to hear it. The fifth track 'Ryker Skies' is another lengthy \r\ntrack that gives once more the opportunity to each member shine. This is probably one of the most interesting \r\ntracks on the album that shows a different and modern edged side of the group. This is may be mainly due to \r\nthe presence of the two new band's members. In reality, it's a very dark track with a very heavy keyboard work. \r\nThis is really a great track with some incredible musical contributions by Westworth. The sixth track 'The \r\nProvince' is the lengthiest track on the album. It starts with Holmes' strings soon followed by Westworth's \r\nkeyboards. Again, we have good vocal performance by Nicholls especially in the acoustic first parts. The track \r\nchanges to a more powerful piece of music featuring the music sounding between Genesis and Dream Theater. \r\nThe powerful and rhythmic organ driven some musical moments which brings to my memory Tony Banks on \r\n'The Return Of The Giant Hogweed' and 'The Musical Box' of Genesis. The seventh and last track 'Closer' is a \r\nvery beautiful ballad and a very sensitive piece of music with a touch of pop music blended in all IQ musical \r\nmoments. This is a very nice way to close this excellent and surprising album from IQ.<p>Conclusion: Since their landmark fifth studio album 'Ever' released in 1993, IQ have been producing great studio \r\nworks that range from their most complex and consistent studio album to date 'Subterranea', released in 1997, \r\ntheir weaker but even excellent album 'The Seventh House', released in 2000 and their probably most brilliant \r\nalbum 'Dark Matter', released in 2004. So, until today, they are a perfect guarantee of a great quality work. And \r\n'Frequency' isn't an exception.  This is an outstanding offering by IQ and proves that with Westword and \r\nEdwards in the line up, the band is yet reaching their peak. 'Frequency' is a must for every IQ fan and is highly \r\nrecommended to all fans of the melodic progressive rock, especially for fans of Genesis in the 70's. And, as I \r\nwrote above, if you have the luck of have a copy of the special edition, you have an extra DVD as a bonus. It \r\nfeatures the wonderful full live gig in Zoetermeer, that includes two old tracks 'Awake And Nervous' and 'It All \r\nStops Here', recent tracks from 'Subterranea' and 'The Seventh House' and two new tracks from 'Frequency', \r\n'Frequency' and 'Crashed And Burned' ('Stronger Than Friction').<p>Prog is my Ferrari.

The band led by \r\nthe consolidated voice of Peter Nicholls masterfully rearranges the sound bases of the genre in modernised melodies \r\nthat flow without urgency or time parameters that limit their development, counting for the occasion on the solvent \r\nMark Westworth on keyboards and Andy Edwards on percussion, replacements for Martin Orford and Paul Cook \r\nrespectively, who left the band after the predecessor \"Dark Matter\".<p>\r\nIQ takes a very brief radio and Morse code fragment of the announcement of the controversial dropping of the \r\nnuclear bomb on Hiroshima to prelude the dense and dark \"Frequency\", a piece that kicks off an album that \r\npersistently makes use of gentle harmonic and neatly marked notes, like Westworth's heartfelt piano complemented \r\nby the atmospheric guitar delay of Mike Holmes in the ballad \"Life Support\", or the beautiful acoustic melody of \"One \r\nFatal Mistake\", or the guitar arpeggios of Holmes, both in the half-time of the intense \"Ryker Skies\" dominated by \r\nWestworth's mellotrons and synthesizers and John Jowitt's powerful bass, and in the super-progressive \"The Province\", \r\na piece that also interchanges the calm ambiences with the thrilling instrumental displays that the solid rhythmic base \r\nof Jowitt's bass and Edwars' percussion propose, surely the best track of the album, and the step prior to the emotive \r\n\"Closer\", the jubilant closing of \"Frequency\". <p>\r\nIQ sails placidly once again in the progressive oceans with \"Frequency\", not sounding repetitive but rather like crew \r\nmembers focused on continuing to explore a familiar but also naturally challenging route.<p>\r\n4 stars\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3062287#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3062287\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3062287\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, June 27, 2024</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=22188#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3062287)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nYes!
