For the casual listener, or the radical fan, Iron Maiden's debut\r\nLP was purely a heavy metal album . Not so. From day one Iron Maiden was a different\r\nband. Steve Harris, bassist\\songwriter\\band leader, was as much a fan of prog music\r\nand he was a metalhead. In their official biography, Run To the Hills, Harris tells\r\nthe story of how he was a prog fan who started playing hard rock because he wasn't\r\nskilled enough to play that kind of music at that time. He cites Genesis, Yes and\r\nJethro Tull as his favourite bands. No wonder Maiden would later record such classic\r\nprog songs like Tull's Crossed Eyed Mary and Nektar's King Of Twilight as single b sides.<p>If Somewhere in time is a classic starting point for many as one of the first prog\r\nmetal of all time, Iron Maiden hinted that as early as five years before. Many prog\r\ntrademarks were present at his songs in this brilliant record. like the suddenly\r\ntempo changes, the intricated melodies, the shifting rhythms. Although young, all the\r\nband members were excellent musicians  and it is no surprise the impact of this\r\nrecord at the time. No HM band sounded like Maiden at the time.<p>Songs like Phantom Of The Opera and Remember Tomorrow are a typical exemple of the\r\nfact you don't have to have keyboards on an album to be prog. Even on heavier songs\r\nlike Prowler or on the more lightweighted Strange World, or the instrumental\r\nTransylvania, the prog elements abound. This CD was. deserverly, a great success when\r\nit was released. It broke new grounds for heavy metal, but not only that. It showed\r\nthe excellent mix of styles that would allow bands like Dream Theatre, Symphony X and\r\nso many others that would appear many years after.  <p>I would recomend this CD to any progmetal fan, or anyone who likes heavy music with\r\ngreat melodies. An all time classic!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93032#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93032\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93032\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93032)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5630\"><strong>darkshade</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5630\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5630/zappa_1988_color_480.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nGlad to see the band is on this site, since they influenced soooo many prog rock and prog \r\nmetal bands that around these days. Most bands in general with twin guitars or even one \r\nguitar site Iron Maiden as an influence.<p>So Maiden's debut. Probably one of their finest albums and one of metal's best. There is a \r\npunk influence through most songs, but this would only be because of the speed and would \r\ninspire a lot of bands to push the envelope, tempo-wise. Songs \r\nlike 'Prowler', 'Sanctuary', 'Running Free', Charlotte the Harlot', and the eponymous title \r\ntrack are full of speed metal fury, but always with a great slab of melody and hook. The \r\nbass is VERY prominent, much like Camel's debut (which btw if you like early Camel, you'll \r\nenjoy Maiden a lot. <p>The two slower numbers 'Remember Tomorrow' and 'Strange World' are quite unlikely \r\nMaiden tunes, but still very good, the latter having a slightly space rock feel to it.<p>The stand out tracks are, of course, the instrumental Transylvania, which is probably one \r\nof the most influential songs from the band, and the epic 'Phantom of the Opera'. POTO is \r\npure prog metal, with the opening intro that's like 'Heart of the Sunrise' with more of an \r\nadrenaline rush. The piece slows down in the middle for a bit before going into prog metal \r\nheaven. That middle section is one of the best moments in music, prog metal or not. So \r\nmelodic and emotional, but kick-ass at the same time, the bass having great rythym.<p>This is considered one of Maiden's best albums and is highly recommended if you're trying \r\nto get into the band. I wouldn't start here, maybe Number of the Beast or Powerslave, but \r\nafter those get this or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

And even if the imagery they developed right from the start is a little embarrassing for an adult, one must say that this form of marketing did them wonders for the next three decades, as they were instantly recognizable between hundreds of band. Maybe what differentiated them from others where their more prog lyrics subject, not really adopting the numbing dumbness of their contemporary bands like Motorhead or Saxon.<p>This album's construction is quite brilliant for a debut alternating short hard (and more basic) tracks such as Prowler, Running Free (poking fun at disco fiends) etc. with the longer more dramatic Remember Tomorrow (and its subtle climates), the climatic Phantom of The Opera and impressive bass-induced Strange World. Yes, the bass: this is probably the main ingredient that made Maiden unique; Steve Harris is clearly the leader and the main inspiration, but unlike in future albums, he has some hard competition with DiAnno's vocals (which I always found the ultimate IM voice). Listen how the instrumental Transylvania gives perfectly way to the superb power ballad of Strange World with some awesome DiAnno to top it all of. And you just know where Klaus Mheine & Co got their inspiration for their golden power ballads.<p>This debut album is still one of my fave metal albums (along with Priest's Sad Wings, Sabbath's Heaven and Hell, Rainbow Rising) and in my heart, this scorchers was never bettered by the band. Call me nostalgic, but this is an incredibly-paced album and although not their best played, it certainly holds their best enthusiasm and does it ever show. Yes iron Maiden is one of my guilty pleasures still nowadays, but guilty maybe, embarrassing a tad, but shameful, no way!! Maiden ruled in this youth's heart but for not that much longer. <p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93152#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93152\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93152\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 3, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93152)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8024\"><strong>WaywardSon</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8024\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20071008_212030_Magic_Pie__Circ.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI remember buying this album quite soon after it was released. To be honest, it is a fairly \r\ndecent debut album,although the sound is a bit tinny and raw at times.<p>The standout tracks are \"Remember Tomorrow\", which starts off slowly and builds up into \r\nsome remarkably tight metal. (with some nice time changes)\r\n\"Phantom of the opera\" is probably the most progressive track on this album and is over \r\nseven minutes long. The twin guitars of Stratton and Murray work well in unison, while \r\nHarris almost seems to play his bass like a lead guitar at times! A great song to listen to on \r\nheadphones. \r\n\"Transylvania\" is a great instrumental with a memorable melody, that you will find yourself \r\nhumming, long after you have put this album back on the shelf.\r\n\"Strange World\" is a nice slow number with some nice laid back singing from Paul di Anno.<p>The other tracks \"Prowler\" \"Sanctuary\" \"Running Free\" (the single taken from this album \r\nand also the weakest song) \"Charlotte the Harlot\" and \"Iron Maiden\" are standard metal \r\nsongs, which are not bad songs, but they don\u00b4t come close to the classic Maiden tracks, \r\nsuch as \"Phantom of the opera\" or \"Transylvania\" \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93417#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93417\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93417\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, October 4, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93417)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is the first record of Iron Maiden. There are some progressive elements, but the album \r\nis definitely metal-oriented. The singer is not Bruce Dickinson: it is rather Paul Di'Anno. \r\nDi'Anno's voice is more gross and less refined than on the Killers album. There is another \r\ndifferent thing here: Denis Stratton plays the guitar instead of Adrian Smith: it sometimes \r\nresults in a wah-wah electric guitar sound, like on the \"Prowler\" song. However, the \r\nrhythmic guitar full of good distortion played by Dave Murray is very recognizable. Steve \r\nHarris' bass is delightful and complex, especially on the \"Phantom of the opera\" track; he is \r\nalso remarkable on tracks like \"Charlotte the Harlot\". Compared to the Killers album, the \r\nsound is more amateurish here; Di'Anno's lead & backing vocals are less flamboyant, and \r\nthe compositions are a bit slower and less elaborated. Finally, let's add the guitars are less \r\nincisive, plus the drums are less fast & elaborated. Shall I add the slight punk tendency \r\npresent on many tracks here. A strong point on this record is the VERY elastic sound, \r\nmainly provided by the bass, a bit like on the Marillion's \"Script from a jester's tear\" album. \r\nThe progressive \"Phantom of the opera\" is one of the best Maiden's tracks. There are \r\ncouples a mellow and very beautiful moments, like the sentimental, melodic and \r\nsoothing \"Strange World\" song, where Di'Anno's normal voice is VERY pleasant to hear. \r\nLet's not forget the catchy \"Iron Maiden\" track, on which the end is absolutely FANTASTIC!<p>Rating: 4.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93545#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93545\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93545\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 5, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93545)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4373\"><strong>Tom Ozric</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=4373\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/4373/image.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFrom the get go, Iron Maiden's Self-Titled debut shows a band whose compositional skills \r\nwere far superior than their contemporaries (Def Leppard, AC/DC etc.) and so presented a \r\nHeavy Metal music with abrupt tempo changes and distinctive sections within their songs \r\nwith a degree of complexity.  The mastermind behind this whole invention is Bassist Steve \r\nHarris, who possesses a unique, distinctive tone to his Bass Guitar (in the same league as \r\nJack Casady from Jefferson Airplane) and plays a big role in the trademark sound Maiden \r\nhave had throughout their career.  Phase 1 of the band featured vocalist Paul D'anno, \r\nwho has a harshish, punky attack to his singing, but can also sing softer passages \r\ntastefully.  I don't want to review track by track as you've probably read many other \r\nreviews already which do so, but sure-fire classics would have to be opener 'Prowler', \r\nwhich is a melting pot of punk/prog and metal,  the proggy 'Phantom of the Opera', the \r\nalmost Floydian 'Strange World', and 'Remember Tomorrow' with it's soft/heavy contrasts.  \r\nGreat album 4/5</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=98682#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=98682\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=98682\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, November 13, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #98682)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nA legendary debut from one of the most sophisticated of the famous heavy metal \r\nbands. Featuring double-guitar assaults, galloping rhythms, virtuosic bass playing, \r\ncompetent drumming, and the entertaining vocals of Paul Di'Anno who is in my opinion \r\nthe best singer that Iron Maiden ever had. He has a wonderful range, powerful vocals, \r\nand a wonderful vibrato in his sustained vocals. Call him the Robert Plant of metal if you \r\nwant.<p>The beginnings of Iron Maiden are very promising. The band started with a very \r\nenergetic sound that will later deteriorate a little to sound more classical and \r\nsophisticated, which I believe is what it made Iron Maiden end up being in this website. \r\nThe crunchy and fast-paced <strong> Prowler </strong> shows a catchy and energetic Iron \r\nMaiden. Another catchy song is <strong> Running Free </strong> which unfortunately is \r\nprobably the weakest song they did in the first 3 albums. It has a linear drumming \r\npattern and a repetitive chorus, and none of the complexity and hooks that make you \r\nwant to listen to it more times. <strong> Iron Maiden </strong> is slightly disappointing because \r\none might expect more from a title track of not only the album but the band's name. It \r\nis still a good catchy rocker, but nothing really sophisticated like the two songs that I \r\nwill explore in the next paragraph.<p>Those three are the least interesting ones. The rest is a hell of a ride! A highlight is \r\n<strong> Remember Tomorrow </strong>. This song's songwriting has to be admired. It has \r\nwonderful soft (verse) - heavy (choruses) in the first two minutes. The verses are just \r\nsimple guitars and Paul's gorgeous vocals until it explodes to a mighty scream and an \r\nincredibly wonderfully crafted guitar riff! Then there goes a fast paced guitar-driven \r\ninstrumental and a last verse-chorus. The other highlight, <strong> Phantom of the Opera \r\n</strong> is more impressive from a technical point of view, and is at least as enjoyable to \r\nlisten to as Remember Tomorrow. It has everything: very interesting lighting-speed \r\ndouble guitar riffs, Paul Di'Anno's best vocal performance (in my opinion), great bass \r\nplaying, tight composition, extended instrumental section, and some of the most \r\nenergetic melodic music I ever came across.<p>The other songs are very good too. <strong> Transylvannia </strong> is an energetic and \r\nvirtuosic instrumental. <strong> Strange World </strong> is the rare Iron Maiden ballad, with \r\nelegant amplified acoustic guitars, gorgeous soaring electric guitars, and Paul's melodic \r\nvocals. It works well as a moment to rest from the loud music from the previous two \r\ntracks. <strong> Charlote the Harlot </strong> is a good rocker made great by the amazing \r\nvoice of Di'Anno. It has a soft musical break around the middle with Paul's great \r\nsustained vibrato vocals in the spotlight, proving that Iron Maiden is not the typical \r\nmetal band. <p>One of their best albums and a great place to start if you are new to the band. This \r\nalbum is not really \"prog\", but it has terrific songwriting, technical playing, accessibility, \r\npowerful vocals, and more complexity than the average hard rock radio music. So, \r\neven if it is not prog, it is an excellent addition to have in your collection.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=103775#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=103775\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=103775\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, December 20, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #103775)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10439\"><strong>Atavachron</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10439\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10439/Envious-Pear-Print-I10303736.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<p>This was the record.  <p>With Ozzy's break from Sabbath and on the heels of Zeppelin's sudden demise, this \r\nLP single-handedly revived heavy rock with a new British patois of complex, linear metal, high musicality \r\nand a dark but intelligent, introspective lyrical content.  On this, the tight debut oft considered their best \r\nby old fans, the acidic rumblings of Punk that had seeped into English culture was finally met face to \r\nface with an equally organic and infectious sound.  It was as if this band was saying, \"Yeah, punk is great, hard rock is great, \r\nbut check this out-- we want to really *play*.  We want to be musical and unexpected in nature, not just \r\nrebellious.\" <p>The group is a well-oiled machine and would go on to become the hardest working rock band in the \r\nworld but at this stage they were still hungry and on a wave of local success that had gotten them this \r\nfar--   they weren't going to disappoint.  'Prowler' and 'Sanctuary' rock the house and Paul Di'Anno, in his first of two studio albums with the band, rips his vocals convincingly with a cool, drunken grunge that hadn't \r\nbeen heard in the other over-produced metal at the time.  The twin guitar attack of Dave Murray & \r\nDennis Stratton set the tone for Iron Maiden's entire career and bassist/musical director Steve Harris \r\nlays the groundwork for, in 1980, some of the most exciting and influential rock music that had come \r\nalong in several years.  The creaky & creepy centerpiece is 'Phantom of the Opera', a seven minute cut \r\nthat demonstrates Maiden's penchant for progressive arrangements, and the rest of the album satisfies \r\nwith 'Strange World', 'Charlotte the Harlot', the title track, and 'Remember Tomorrow' is a \r\nromantic haunter that builds to its climactic riff before returning to softness again.  <p>Iron Maiden was a music lover's punk rock-- a thinking man's metal with clever passages \r\nand surprising musicianship that appealed to fans' craving for new energy after Prog's demise and \r\nbefore the marketing of heavy metal as an industry...  and no one did it better.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=114881#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=114881\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=114881\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, March 12, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #114881)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10022\"><strong>The Whistler</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10022\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10022/J-Tull_Christmas--again--small.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIf you, like me, thought that eighties metal had very little to offer you, and that an album with a zombified cover and such \r\nintelligent titles as \"Charlotte the Harlot\" and \"Transylvania\" should be used largely as coasters or Frisbees, then stop yourself \r\nand give this a listen, I think you (too) will be pleasantly surprised. <p>Now, \"Prowler\" does open up like a pop metal number. But it's a real good one, clever riff, great lyrics about feeling yourself in \r\npublic (in a catchy as hell chorus no less). Except, this ain't no pop metal number, 'cause about a minute into it, it completely \r\nshifts gears, and the guitar solo ends up being playing in a different tempo. Art-pop-metal. Great start. <p>\"Sanctuary\" is a good number too, but why is it that every time I heard it, I think the chorus will go, \"Breaking the law, breaking \r\nthe law?\" Maybe someone can explain that to me. \"Remember Tomorrow\" takes a few too many turns to be a real power ballad, \r\nbut that doesn't stop it from being about as memorable as a pile of dog crap. But \"Running Free\" opens with an infectious, funky \r\ndrum beat, and it all continues from there; it's a pretty catchy, toe tappin' piece of pop metal. <p>Designed to be the album's set piece is the miniature suite \"Phantom of the Opera.\" At the surface it's an ode to dark, misplaced \r\nlove, but at the core, it's a complex series of classical and medieval inspired riffs and blistering solos. In other words, this is \r\nperfect for headbanging to at home, or while you're on your dark warhorse, charging into battle against the Huns! It's the best \r\nsong on the album, and so far, my favorite Maiden song besides. <p>\"Transylvania\" is a quick, two part instrumental based on a solid enough riff, and the first part sounds like a metalized Irish jig, \r\nand the second part contains some really kick-ass drumming. Cool. This slides flawlessly into the ballady \"Strange World,\" which \r\neither has really cool, or really stupid lyrics. But never mind that, the atmosphere is real neat, very \"Catch the Rainbow.\" So the \r\nsolo is kind of David Gilmourish; some people like that. <p>Not necessarily a highlight, \"Charlotte the Harlot\" contains one of the most classic metal themes: a dirty girl. Okay, so it's no \r\ngreat shake, but I dare you to get the chorus out of your head. It can't be done! Probably. And the \"quiet\" part is a little \r\nmuch...maybe if it were shorter. Well, hey, at least they call poor Charlotte a harlot, which gives the song an antique feel, as \r\nopposed to a whore or something...oh, wait, they do call her a whore too. Uh, ignore that. <p>And we close with the title track, which takes us out essentially as we came in; another piece of solid art pop metal. Again, really \r\nnice chorus (gotta love that the lyrics are both evil and offhanded), and it takes enough twists to be interesting. Nice ending. <p>Now, I ain't gonna lie to you. This isn't the world's greatest album. On the one hand (almost) all the songs are entertaining. Of \r\ncourse, everything sounds exactly the same too. This album is even less diverse than Long Live Rock 'n Roll, which is, in its own \r\nway, a neat little accomplishment. <p>Also, the musicianship is both technically flawless, and absolutely throwaway. Technically flawless because, well, because it's \r\ntechnically flawless. Completely throwaway because, well, nothing here, barring the odd \"totally awesome\" solo has a lot of soul. \r\nThere's less soul here than there is on a King Crimson album even, if that's believable. And no one is going to be with the band all \r\nthat long, sorry to say. <p>In fact, you shouldn't even bother learning the names of anyone in this band...except for singer Paul di'Anno and bassist Steve \r\nHarris. Di'Anno, I think, gives the band a certain uniqueness; he's not what you generally expect from an eighties metal band \r\nsinger (does he sound sorta like Mick Jagger to anyone else?). And Harris is simply an amazing bassist (\"Transylvania,\" \"Iron \r\nMaiden\"). I'm glad he's the main mover and shaker behind the Maiden instead of the drummer of something. Er, not that the \r\ndrumming's not good, it's great, as are the guitars. But I somehow think it would be harder to replace Harris. <p>Still, if nothing else, Iron Maiden can prove to you that decent music wasn't quite dead in the eighties. It can also prove that \r\nmetal can be somewhat dirty, but still be noble; all sound the same, but remain interesting up till the last note. Great album, and \r\nan okay cover too, once you get used to it. Just be sure to hide it from grandma (or, put it in her sock drawer, whatever feels \r\nright). <p>(The re-release of said record includes all kinds of neato, computer dependent extra features that are utterly useless! Well, \r\npartly true. Partly because they're so hard to view! I could only lookit them on one computer out of many, and that was at work, \r\nso I have to be fast about reviewing this. There are plenty of snippets of later albums to be sampled, but you can do that \r\nanywhere. There's also a look at the Eddie Video Game! Cool, eh? The main attraction is the two videos of \"Phantom\" and \"Iron \r\nMaiden\" from the Rainbow, which are extremely valuable if you want to see Di'Anno take his shirt off. Both are good fun, if not \r\nnecessarily standout in their own way (and neither finds syncing up image and sound all that important). They stick pretty close \r\nto the studio versions, but they're a bit more energetic...and \"Phantom\" is shorter. I don't know which is better; \"Phantom\" I \r\nguess. Diehard Maiden fans might want to raise the rating half a point for that, but all else need not bother.)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=144711#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=144711\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=144711\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 14, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #144711)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11631\"><strong>Windhawk</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11631\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11631/lpvet2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn 1980 Iron Maiden released their self-titled debut album, starting what would become a legendary career for the band. They\r\nwere one of many promising bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement at the time; and still some development away\r\nfrom being the leader of the pack. However, some historic record covers soon made them quite famous, giving the band\r\ninvaluable PR at the start of their career.<p>Musically, Iron Maiden's debut album is an inconsistent affair. They try out a number of different styles, and it is obvious\r\nthat they are uncertain of what type of music that really suits them at this point. The guitar riffs used in most tracks\r\nobviously have been somewhat influenced by the punk movement; and in tracks like \"The Prowler\" punk inspired riffs are used\r\nextensively, played in a fast and simple fashion. The overall sound also indicates the influence from 70's hard rock though,\r\nand the track has a surprisingly light pop feel about it.<p>Tracks like \"Remember Tomorrow\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\" showcase Iron Maiden's progressive influences; and the latter\r\ntrack also showcases some of the styles Iron Maiden would pursue later in their career, especially the \"epic\" chomping guitar\r\nriffing underscored by bass that the group would utilize in many future long songs.<p>Strange World is the odd one out on the album; one of the few mellow tracks ever made by the band. The slight psychedelic\r\ntouch and the detailed moods made in this track are unique in the history of Iron Maiden; and tracks like this one probably\r\nwas abandoned when the band started figuring out where to go musically.<p>The rest of the tracks here are to a greater or lesser degree mostly fast paced hard rock tunes with some metal edges to\r\nthem; relatively simple in structure and style. There are quite a few differences in detail on the tracks; but all of them\r\nshare some basic facts - punk-inspired riffs, influences from 70's hard rock to a greater or lesser degree, and high on\r\nintensity.<p>There are quite a few standout tracks on this album; and all of the songs here are seen as classic Iron Maiden tracks, apart\r\nfrom the mellow \"Strange World\". Not all of the tracks are at their best here though; the band was young and inexperienced\r\nwhen this album was recorded, which is easily heard. In many instances the later live recordings of the tracks here are much\r\nbetter than the original recordings; and as the overall sound here is much unlike what Iron Maiden would sound like later,\r\nthis is not a release that can be seen as a must buy. Indeed, fans that haven't heard this album previously will be rather\r\nsurprised on first listen.<p>Still, it's a good release as long as you're able to live with it's various shortcomings; and a must buy for anyone that\r\nwants to find out more about Iron Maiden's musical background and inspirations.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=145707#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=145707\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=145707\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 18, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #145707)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn those Purpleless years, \"Iron Maiden\" released a strong debut album which will pave the way for a new style of music. A hard-rock \r\ndeviation called heavy metal.<p>\"Purple\" of course but also \"Rainbow\" (\"Rising\" period) are the influences. To a certain extent, \"Runing Free\" has also \r\nsome \"Sabbath\" flavours. <p>My fave are \"Prowler\", a solid post-punkish opener, \"Transilvanya\" with an infernal beat, a superb bass line, some special backing \r\nvocals and of course a fantastic guitar play. These guitars are a serious asset for the band. Ritchie being the model IMO. This song \r\nis probably the more \"heavy metal\" type one from this album. It is more sophisticated than most of the songs which will be rather \r\nstraight-forward, with a simple structure.<p>Almost each song is holding a great guitar solo : \"Phantom Of The Opera\", \"Strange World\" (even if it is a rock ballad), \"Remember \r\nTomorrow\" with this great cresendo builing and the fantastic beat during the second part are some examples.<p>This album is full of energy, yet not too heavy. And I like it. In those early eighties, I wasn't into hard-rock (or related) for a long \r\ntime already  (six years). I re-discover the genre(s) only five years ago but I can definitely recommend this debut to all Ritchie fans \r\n(not his last and folkish project of course).<p>The only weaker song is \"Sanctuary\". Raw rock'n'roll. Punk is not far away.<p>Four stars for this very good debut.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=150309#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=150309\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=150309\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, November 12, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #150309)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe guy on the cover bears a striking resemblance to my woodworking teacher in highschool, but that's \r\nanother story. IRON MAIDEN's debut is so much better than I thought it would be. I remember several \r\nyears ago a guy coming into my work and I had MOTORHEAD's \"Ace Of Spades\" on, and we got talking \r\nabout Metal. He told me that Paul Di'Anno was his favourite singer and IRON MAIDEN's debut was their \r\nbest album. I had to confess that I hadn't heard their debut and didn't know Paul Di'Anno. Well I do now ! \r\nThis is raw and edgy yet you can hear their future classic sounds quite often. This is an excellent record \r\nperiod.The band were fortunate enough that year(1980) to open for JUDAS PRIEST on their \"British Steel\" \r\ntour in the UK. They also opened for KISS during their European tour that year giving IRON MAIDEN lots of \r\nexposure at home and abroad. They released two singles off this record \"Running Free\" \r\nand \"Sanctuary\". Some fantastic pictures of the band in the remastered and enhanced cd version that i \r\nown.<p>\r\n\"Prowler\" kicks things off with a bang. Love the dual guitars in the intro as Di'Anno comes in with \r\nauthority. He has such a great voice. Check out Harris 2 minutes in as the tempo picks up with some \r\nblistering guitar. The slight tempo shifts are so cool. Killer opening track. \"Sanctuary\" is another uptempo \r\ntune with a great instrumental section that starts before 1 1/2 minutes. \"Remember Tomorrow\" is a top 3 \r\ntrack for me. I like the atmosphere to open. Paul's reserved vocals recall some seventies prog singers. The \r\nheavy sections are incredible. I like the contrast.Killer guitar before 3 minutes as contrast \r\ncontinues. \"Running Free\" features some chunky bass lines from Harris. Great rhythm to this one. It's \r\nsimple but catchy. <p>\"Phantom Of The Opera\" opens with a cool guitar melody as drums and bass join \r\nin. Vocals a minute in. Almost a reggae flavour when the sound changes after 2 minutes. There is a \r\nsignificant passage after 4 1/2 minutes as we get a galloping rhythm that MAIDEN would become famous \r\nfor. \"Transylvania\" is also a top 3 track for me. This one is an instrumental that again features their \r\namazing future sound. \"Strange World\" is the last top 3 track for me on here. Lots of atmosphere as a \r\nbeautiful guitar solo rises out of it and reserved vocals join in. The guitar soars 3 minutes in. \"Charlotte \r\nThe Harlot\" is a fun, catchy and uptempo song. It gets better as it plays out. The calm that arrives 2 minutes \r\nin has a seventies flavour to it.  \"Iron Maiden\" opens with guitars and they do sound amazing. Check out \r\nthe bass solo after 2 minutes. A big finish to this one.<p>\r\nFor me there are no weak tracks, I like them all. I wished I knew about these guys in 1980, but at least by \r\n1983 I did come to know them very well through the \"Piece Of Mind\" record.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162288#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162288\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=162288\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, February 21, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #162288)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>\"Iron Maiden\"</em> is the eponymously titled debut full-length studio album by UK heavy metal act <B>Iron Maiden</B>. The album was released through <B>EMI Records</B> in April 1980. <B>Iron Maiden</B> was formed in 1975 and following a period of lineup changes, and punk music dominance, they started receiving a lot of positive feedback for their live performances during the last years of the 70s. The success of <em>\"The Soundhouse Tapes\"</em> demo (recorded on New years Eve 1978, and released in 1979) further strengthened their profile. <p>The album is usually tagged NWoBHM, which was a late 70s/early 80s heavy metal movement, which typically combined the raw energy of punk with the 70s hard rock and heavy metal sound of artists like <B>Black Sabbath</B>, <B>Rush</B>, <B>Deep Purple</B>, <B>Rainbow</B>, <B>Uriah Heep</B>, <B>Thin Lizzy</B>, and <B>Judas Priest</B>. And that is a pretty valid description of the music featured on <em>\"Iron Maiden\"</em>. The rawness and badass attitude of punk combined with the heavy, epic, and melodic elements of 70s heavy rock/metal.<p>The music on the album is generally very raw and unpolished helped along by the raw vocals by <B>Paul Di'Anno</B>, and the rather simple yet powerful drumming by <B>Clive Burr</B>. The guitar riffs, harmony leads, and guitar solos, played by <B>Dave Murray</B> and <B>Dennis Stratton</B>, and the very dominant bass playing by <B>Steve Harris</B> are usually very melodic and played at a fast pace. Even when they play most raw and simple there\u00b4s always a melodic sensibility to the playing. Although the band has often dismissed being influenced by punk there is a rather obvious punk influence on the generally fast paced tracks like <em>\"Prowler\"</em>, <em>\"Sanctuary\"</em>, <em>\"Running Free\"</em> and <em>\"Iron Maiden\"</em>. The more ballad type tracks <em>\"Remember Tomorrow\"</em> and <em>\"Strange World\"</em> at times come close to sounding like 70s prog rock. The most prog rock oriented track on the album is <em>\"Phantom of the Opera\"</em> and <em>\"Transylvania\"</em> though. <em>\"Charlotte the Harlot\"</em> is a mid tempo heavy rocker. So there is nice variation between tracks but at the same time a stylistic consistency which ensures a good overall flow.<p>The sound production is organic, raw, and very well sounding, perfectly suiting the music. So while the songwriting at times is a bit immature compared to later releases by <B>Iron Maiden</B>, this is still a great quality debut album by the band, featuring high level musicianship, catchy material, and an excellent sounding production. A 4 star (80%) rating is deserved.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162801#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=162801\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=162801\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, February 27, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #162801)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17488\"><strong>Petrovsk Mizinski</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17488\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17488/Sex.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter the band had gained a fair bit of fame and had released their very fast selling EP The\r\nSoundhouse Tapes, the band had finally released their self titled debut after they first formed in\r\n1975 and went through a few line up changes.\r\nThe line up on this album consisted of Paul Di'Anno on vocals, Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton both\r\non guitar, Steve Harris on bass and Clive Burr on the drums and a solid line up it was indeed for\r\nthis album.\r\nThe album cover itself is very evocative and just screams New Wave Of British Heavy Metal right at you.<p>The album is a bit inconsistent musically, but that isn't usually anything out of the ordinary for\r\nmany band's debut albums.\r\nThe album kicks off with <strong>Prowler</strong>, which is kinda catchy and has a cool tempo increase at 1:46,\r\nwith an unfortunately somewhat sloppy guitar solo, which I'm guessing was Dave Murray as live\r\nperformances around that time often show him bending out of tune. Even if the effect was\r\nintentional, which I hope it wasn't, it just sounds a bit off and unpleasant to the ears.\r\n<strong>Sanctuary</strong> is a pretty straight forward metal song, and like many of the songs off this album\r\nyou can hear a punk influence going on.\r\nThe next song, <strong>Remember Tomorrow</strong> is definitely one the more interesting songs on the album,\r\nfeaturing some of Maiden's progressive influences in the song writing. Excellent song, with great\r\nvocals and the rest of the band in shining form.\r\nUp next, is a pretty average and uninspiring track, <strong>Running Free</strong>.<p>But what comes next, is anything but uninspiring. <strong>Phantom Of The Opera</strong>. \r\nThe opening riff is really cool and from there onwards, the track gathers steam, and the song feels\r\nmuch shorter than the 7 minute+ track length. There is a seriously cool harmony part after the 6/8\r\nsection, featuring all stringed instrument wielding guys playing a melody in the same rhythm.\r\nAfter that section is over, we get to hear what would become a signature sound for Iron Maiden. Yes,\r\nthe galloping rhythm section just after the 4:30, and then onto a cool instrumental section which\r\nfeatures some 2 great solos from Murray and Stratton.\r\nAfter following a fairly non linear path throughout, the band finally comes back to the B (second)\r\nsection of the song form. An amazing song, with a cool progressive song writing path.<p><Strange World>  has loads of beautiful atmosphere and some very nice guitar work and oddly very\r\ntouching vocals from Di'Anno, a stunning ballad-ish type song<p><strong>Transylvania</strong> is the instrumental track on the album, with a slight progressive edge to it.\r\nMany cool guitar solos, nice emotive riffs and very well paced, never dull, never uninspiring, just\r\nvery well executed.<p>Those 3 songs are definitely my favorite songs off the album and the most progressive, and to me are\r\nthe sounds of proto-prog metal in action.<p><strong> Charlotte The Harlot</strong> is another pretty straight forward song, although I really do like the\r\ncalm section that beings towards the middle of the song, which has some really nice vocals and\r\nguitar parts.<p>I remember the first time I heard <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> and just being disappointed, because I was\r\nhoping the track that shared the name with the band would be something truly special, but it wasn't.\r\nIt's kinda catchy and a good rocker, with a cool instrumental part, but otherwise just a fairly\r\naverage song.<p>The production of the album is a little weak, somewhat thin, and although in a way I feel it suits\r\nthe feel of the album, it could have benefited from a little more strength in the overall sound.<p>While the song writing was hit and miss, there is no denying the influence this album had, it's\r\nplace in heavy metal history and the heart's of prog metal fans/rockers and metal fans alike.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=175698#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=175698\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=175698\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 29, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #175698)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs I was quite late knowing the band, I only got the first album \"Piece of Mind\" with Bruce\r\nDickinson as lead vocal. In fact, when I later found the debut album (self titled) I found Paul\r\nDi'anno's voice is excellent and..the debut album itself is excellent! It's very rare that the\r\nband's debut album with excellent quality but Iron Maiden proved it. For heavy metal fans this album\r\nis considered as an influential album in the development of the genre. Some people, in fact, mention\r\nthat this album as the foundation of thrash, speed and progressive metal. No wonder Dream Theater\r\nadore this band. <p>The music is fast, catchy, exciting, memorable and it pumps your adrenalin to run faster. There are\r\nstunning guitar work between Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton augmented by tight bass lines by the\r\nmaster mind Steve Harris. The opening Prowler, incorporates  wah-wah guitar licks with dynamic\r\nriffs, solid bass lines, and a great solo. Sanctuary blasts off with inventive bass line as the\r\nmain element of the song combined with two solos. Remember Tomorrow starts like a ballad using\r\nguitar melodies as well as harmonies on growling bass which then flows into catchy chorus. Running\r\nThree runs with a faster tempo back by excellent rhythm and jaw-dropping drum work. Phantom of the\r\nOpera and Strange World, both have great harmonies and catchy rhythm. Transylvania, is an\r\ninstrumental which features guitar backed by bass line. Charlotte the Harlot and Iron Maiden\r\nconclude the album excellently.<p>It's an excellent heavy metal album.

Certainly the album shows where the band would eventually go under the flag and\r\nlungs of their second vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, but he's not around yet (nor is the majority of the\r\nclassic line-up, but still) and neither is the fantasy sound that the band would later adopt as well\r\nas keyboards. This is a very 'street' sounding album, and the look of the guys in their leather on\r\nthe back cover only helps that image along. A strange album to review for a progressive rock\r\nwebsite, but it will be done none the less.<p>The album does have some very progressive moments, and these are the ones likely to stand out to the\r\nprog-heads thinking about purchasing this album. While the majority of the album is strait up\r\nBritish heavy metal it has to be admitted that this album was 'progressive' in its own time for\r\nbeing one of the first Power Metal albums to emerge and remains as one of the most influential to\r\nthis day. Still, if we're talking in terms of progressive rock down to the mathematical definition\r\n(which is the one most proggers are concerned about), there's still a few tunes that fit the bill.\r\nOne of the biggest standouts on the album is the 7-minute pseudo-epic <B>Phantom Of The Opera</B>\r\nwith it's stinging guitar opening and killer bass sections from one Steve Harris along with some of\r\nDi'Anno's best vocal performances. Tempo changes and a good pace make for a very\r\nprog-metal-beginnings sounding song. Along with this is the slow-to-fast speed changey goodness of\r\nthe wonderful <B>Remember Tomorrow</B>, which features some great guitar wails and vocal screams in\r\nthis unique sounding some from Maiden who's style would rarely be used in their future material.\r\nAnother more 'proggy' moment on the album is the wonderful instrumental, <B>Transylvania</B>, which\r\nseems to be tailor made to follow up <B>Phantom of The Opera</B> in a speedy way.<p>The rest of the songs on the album are all very good, but more to the metal side of things. Proggers\r\nwho don't mind raising the horns and headbanging will no doubt get a kick out of these tunes, but\r\npeople who would rather see Wakeman's cape flap in the breeze while performing the solo to <I>The\r\nRevealing Science Of God</I> may find a tough time enjoying these tunes. They're all a little more\r\nsimple, with a nice chorus section and usually some kind of great hook. <B>Prowler</B> has a very\r\nnice riff to open and moves right into metal territory with the lyric and vocal section. <B>Running\r\nFree</B> has a great crowd chant section for a chorus and a headbanging pace, while <B>Iron\r\nMaiden</B> remains a crowd favorite during concerts thanks to its fun chorus.<p>Maiden fans and fans of progressive metal alike should get a good kick out of this album. Fans of\r\nmore traditional symphonic arrangements or people who enjoy the more RIO side of things may want to\r\nsteer clear of this debut from Iron Maiden, but the quality of music from the boys at so early an\r\nage in their career is quite impressive. Were this a metal site it would be getting a higher mark,\r\nbut here it's going to receive a 3 out of 5. Excellent playing with some very impressive numbers,\r\nbut more metal than prog.

This great band start its career with this superb effort. This album is \r\nfull of musical virtuosity and great songs like Remember Tomorrow, Phantom of the Opera, Transylvania \r\nand Strange World. All other songs are excellent and there aren't weak songs. This homonymous debut \r\nalbum by Iron Maiden contains all the power needed for one excellent heavy metal album. It is very \r\npleasant that there are progressive themes implemented in this heavy metal masterpiece. Exciting\r\ndebut album by exciting band. There is something else that comes to my attention - and this is punk \r\nmoments. This album was released at the height of punk rock and probably contains something from it. I \r\ndon't like punk rock, but I adore this album. 4.25 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=200921#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=200921\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=200921\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, January 28, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #200921)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=13461\"><strong>debrewguy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=13461\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070502_212715_b&#111;nscott1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nJust finished watching Iron Maiden's Flight 666 - the Movie, and thought I'd go through some reviews\r\nwhile at PA. And surprise, I haven't reviewed any of their albums. <p>\r\nSo here goes. Following Sean's comment about the NWOBHM, my own story is that Creem had a heavy\r\nmetal issue with Maiden, Def Leppard and Krokus (???) as part of the bright new lights of metal. SO\r\nI picked up Maiden's debut as well as the other two. WHOA ! Brimming with energy & attitude like punk, but not punk. Full of\r\nvirtuosity like prog, but not airy fairy. Heavy, and metallic, but not like Sabbath, certainly not\r\nlike Judas Priest; although the JP guys often would grumble about Maiden's success compared to\r\ntheirs. Something about the twin guitar attack. which Wishbone Ash, and Thin Lizzy did before Judas\r\nPriest , and better, too. <p>\r\nNo, this was modern. Prog ... well not quite, or really , not always. Phantom of the Opera has to be\r\nconsidered as the first prog metal composition. Fantasy lyrics, flying fingers on distorted guitars\r\n, playing something way beyond yer over-amplified blooze on a 12 bar 4/4 structure. Remember\r\nTomorrow & Strange World may have shown some Judas Priest influence. But if you listen to the\r\nstructure, the organization of the songs, you may find more in common with MK II Deep Purple. \r\nD'Ianno didn't have Gillan's range, but he did share that \"how can he not be shredding his vocal\r\nchords\" singing style. And , IMHO, I find the same group energy amongst both groups'\r\ninstrumentalists. True, the Murray / Stratton tag team was no match for the fret deity that was\r\nBlackmore. But add Steve Harris forceful bass to the mix, and Clive Burr's solid drumming and you\r\nhave a musical team that had learned well from the masters. Lord, Paice, and Glover might have\r\nplayed second fiddle in the Rock God race next to Ritchie, but as time has shown, King Ritchard\r\nnever climbed the same heights without them. Versus Iron Maiden, who would only get better, and become\r\nthe best with time. <p>\r\nThe rest of the songs - Prowler, Sanctuary, Running Free, Charlotte the Harlot, Iron Maiden - still\r\nsound fresh & energetic today, even when compared to the current power metal acts. And , maybe as a\r\nreflection of my age, I've never found another power or prog metal band  that could compare. Why ?\r\nMaiden wrote songs, riffs ! The complicated and complex guitar parts seemed a natural part of the\r\nmusic, whereas too often these days, it comes across as calculated and copied from somewhere else. As if the guitar player(s) said \"O.K. where do I put my fiddly bit(s)?\".<p>\r\n Harris has always felt that the Will Malone production took away from the force of the music, but\r\nmost of his fans still vote this debut as among their best. It didn't re-invent the wheel. But it\r\ndid add an super overdrive gear and shows the first sparks of  a sophistication that showed how\r\nother bands easily get lost when laying on the heavy metal thunder. <p><p>And how accurate was Creem's view of the new scene's prospects ? Well, Krokus quickly became a\r\ncartoon. Def Leppard hit big quicker & bigger, but also faded fast after their peak. They now are relegated to the summer \"Oldies\" fair tours with other 80s' rockers relying on people looking to drive down memory lane. Maiden ?\r\nWell, there seems to have been a few people coming out to their Somewhere in Time tour. And not just\r\nmiddle aged fogeys looking to hear that hit from 1987.<p><p>Well worth any metal head's, and truly any heavy or prog metal fan's time and money.

They\r\nweren't at their songwriting peak yet and their playing wasn't as tight and dashing as it would\r\nbecome, but still, Paul Di'Anno had so much attitude and soul that I prefer these two albums to much\r\nof their later successes. <p>Even though this music sounds rather dated now, the punch and energy can still be felt. So it's no\r\nsurprise that tracks like <em>Prowler</em>, <em>Running Free</em>, <em>Charlotte the Harlot</em> and\r\n<em>Iron Maiden</em> took the mellowed-out hard-rock scene of the end of the 70's by storm. The\r\nstraightforward power, no-nonsense attitude and raw dynamism are simply irresistible.<p>But it's not those tracks that would be defining for Maiden's future music. This band had more\r\ntricks up their sleeve then fast punk-rock anthems. <em>Remember Tomorrow</em> for example is an\r\nexcellent take on the prog-metal of Judas Priest's <em>Beyond The Realms of Death</em> epic.\r\n<em>Phantom of the Opera</em> is the most progressive and most amazing track of the album, sounding\r\nlike a Jethro Tull song from <em>Benefit</em> that is taken by storm; rapid, metalized and brutal. It\r\nalso feature some Uriah Heep alike vocal harmonies and a fine balance between slow and reflective\r\nparts and fast galloping riffs. Also the instrumental <em>Transylvania</em> is fun. A personal\r\nfavourite is the delightful ballad <em>Strange World</em>, again highly in debt to Judas Priest's\r\nballadry.<p>This is Maiden's rawest album, combining elements of old-school metal from Judas Priest and Rainbow\r\nwith the rough energy and harsh sound of punk. Together with some hints at their future prog-metal,\r\nit's a combination that results in pure gold on this album.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=259397#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=259397\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=259397\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, January 5, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #259397)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23504\"><strong>Marty McFly</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23504\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23504/owl.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWhen listening to 80's metal, most of them sounds boring to me. Not Iron Maiden. Fate arranged my life in a way that I met Iron \r\nMaiden not when I was a child, but when I was in early adult years. I've get to this group as responsible, normally thinking guy, \r\nnot as part of childhood memories. Therefore, my judgment would be influenced by these conditions. Fortunately, this band has \r\nto offer a lot. <p>As I said, \"normal\" Metal is boring, not providing needed \"experiences\", or thrill if you want to say that. Yes, speaking as Prog fan, \r\nbut also as someone who came from Classic Rock origins. Irons are here, for thirty years, smiling with their creature Eddie and \r\nspitting into face of all those who dislike them. Because they had guts to stand in front of scene back then and prove their worth, \r\nmanage it all, beat all those others to background and show whole world that they should be heard.<p>Musically of course, you can't compare them with Genesis. Or can you ? Never mind, this battle can't be won by either side and is \r\nmeaningless to compare them like that. To the point: riffs are main element here. Yes, this is Heavy Metal of a new kind (as \r\nopposing to 70's HM) and so it has its attributes. However, tracks like <strong>Strange World</strong> with its exploring intro, sad solo after \r\nit and kings ending.<p>There, you can see (and hear) music with soul. Music that's Prog in a not so conventional way. Common, compare it with other \r\ntypical NWoBHM bands, you'll know who's the winner by your heart (brain). For me, it's Maiden.<p>4(+), it's Prog-Related for a good cause.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=273298#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=273298\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=273298\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, March 21, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #273298)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20672\"><strong>J-Man</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20672\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20672/10363795_667676003270041_3933815434573087984_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe self-titled debut album from famed NWoBHM band Iron Maiden is without a doubt one of the most\r\nimportant albums in the early eighties heavy metal scene. This was surely a groundbreaking album\r\nwhen it was released back in 1980, but it's always been overshadowed by some of Iron Maiden's later\r\nreleases for me and I've never really given it much attention. About a week ago I realized that I\r\nhave absolutely no Iron Maiden reviews even though they are my favorite traditional heavy metal\r\nband, so I figured that it's time for me to review their albums chronologically! I've had <em>Iron\r\nMaiden</em> on heavy rotation lately in preparation for my review, and even though I will never like\r\nthis album as much as <em>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son</em>, I've been able to appreciate it much more\r\nthan my previous lukewarm experiences.<p>The sound on this album is unquestionably Iron Maiden, but with more punk and less prog influences.\r\nI've always loved Iron Maiden's progressive tendencies and epic song structures while still\r\nultimately remaining a traditional heavy metal band, but the only truly epic songs here are\r\n<em>Phantom of the Opera</em> and <em>Strange World</em>. These are the two best songs IMO, though there\r\nreally aren't any fillers. <em>Running Free</em> and <em>Sanctuary</em> are pretty mediocre songs, even\r\nthough they aren't total throwaways. <em>Transylvania</em> is a great instrumental track, and one of\r\nthe best from the album. There are some great straightforward metal tracks like <em>Iron Maiden</em>,\r\n<em>Charlotte the Harlot</em>, <em>Remember Tomorrow</em>, and <em>Prowler</em> as well. All in all, if\r\nyou like raw sounding heavy metal with punk influences, most of the album should appeal you. Just\r\ndon't go in expecting epic, borderline progressive, metal songs that you would find on their later\r\nalbums.<p>Iron Maiden was a five-man band at this point. All of the musicians are fantastic, although they\r\nsurely improved over time. A special note should go out to my idol Steve Harris. Man, what a bass\r\nplayer! His pounding basslines are very present on most of Iron Maiden's music, and it almost serves\r\nas a lead instrument. A lot of people complain about Paul Di'Anno's vocal style, but I personally\r\nfind it to be very good. He's nowhere near the vocal prowess of Bruce Dickinson, but he is surely a\r\ntalented vocalist. Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton's guitars work mutually and really compliment\r\neach other well. The multilayered guitars really give Iron Maiden their own sound. Clive Burr's\r\ndrumming is good, but it could be slightly improved in some areas. It's hard to criticize him,\r\nthough, considering how fantastic his drumming is on <em>Transylvania</em>.<p>The production is really good for a NWoBHM album. Iron Maiden was never a sucker for crappy 80's\r\nproduction qualities, and I love how they stuck with more organic 70's sounds. However, the music is\r\nlacking a bit of a \"punch\" and the production could be a bit more powerful at times.<p><B><em>Conclusion:</em></B><p><em>Iron Maiden</em> is a solid debut album by Iron Maiden. Even though I will never like this as much\r\nas their later albums with Bruce Dickinson behind the microphone, few heavy metal bands could\r\ncompete with Iron Maiden back then. Even on this slightly immature debut, the genius of Iron Maiden\r\nshines through, though not as brilliantly as it would soon become. A 3.5 (almost 4) star rating is\r\ndeserved for this solid debut.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284077#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284077\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284077\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, May 29, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284077)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden - s/t (1980)<p>The first two album of Iron Maiden are really different from the Number of the Beast era and \r\nafter that. Lead singer Paul Di'Anno has an amazing enthusiastic rock/punk voice and the \r\nstyle of the band is a mixture of heavy rock with a lot of melodic parts (for Metal that is) and \r\nenergetic rock'n roll waves. The debut album of Maiden sounds as a debut should sound: \r\nwild, naive and rockin'! The recognizable artwork of Iron Maiden is already in place. Perhaps \r\nthe artwork is a bit too dark for the music and attitude of the band, but it become an \r\nimportant element of the bands style.  <p>There has been some debate about the recording of this record. I only have one simple \r\nthing to add to this controversy: A vinyl version of the album sounds great. <p>Well, Iron Maiden is perhaps one of the best collaborations of great musicians in the metal-\r\nworld. The shy band-leader Steve Harris and guitar-god Dave Murray form the basis of the \r\nband. People who are musicians themselves will here a special approach to the music: \r\nwhen focussed on the fact the bass-player writes most of the songs a magical world opens: \r\nAn eighties metal-band with melodic bass-lines! The guitars are amazing and the solo's of \r\nIron Maiden have always been good. <p>The songwriting is strong. No stadium-rock non-sense, no standard head-banging riffs: \r\nIron Maiden was far ahead of the bands of eighties. Prowler is an energetic rock' opener \r\nwith a remarkable use of the wah-pedal. Sanctuary focusses on the rock-side of the music \r\nwhilst Remember Tomorrow shows the great emotional part of the band. On this song the \r\nvocals are especially memorable. Running Free is a simple track, but still effective. \r\nPhantom of the Opera is Iron Maiden's first epic with very progressive songwriting and great \r\nmusicianship. The instrumental Transylvania further explores Iron Maiden's compositional \r\nand technical possibilities. Strange World is one of the bands most silent songs. It's a \r\nbeautiful atmospheric song with nice cleans guitars and a gentle distorted solo's. Great \r\ntune! Charlotte the Harlot is a great fusion between Iron Maidens rock'n roll tendencies and \r\nit's melodic emotional approach. The final track, the Iron Maiden-song, is a rocker with nice \r\nriffs and the usual energetic approach. Great!<p>Conclusion. Well, I can't think of a lot of other records of this quality of the year 1980. It's a \r\ngreat start for the band and still a great album today. Perhaps this has little to do with the \r\nprogressive movement, but Iron Maiden's style might still be very appealing to most fans of \r\nprogressive music because of the melodic and inventive approach of the band. Four stars!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284297#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284297\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284297\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 31, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284297)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25731\"><strong>EatThatPhonebook</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25731\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25731/anno-domini-high-definiti&#111;n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is one of the first important NWOBHM albums, and possibly one of the best of the early days. Together with Iron Maiden there \r\nwas Saxon, Motorhead, Judas Priest, and Def Leppard, and all of them gave a huge contribute in changing completely Heavy \r\nMetal's style. Iron Maiden was probably the most popular band, and the most important. Still today we think of IM as one of the best \r\nHeavy Metal bands ever, and some even consider them THE best.<p>When this album came out, in 1980, everything changed. Obviously the sound was different, more heavy, a mixture between punk \r\nand all those Hard Rock bands that are usually defined as Proto Metal. The album in it's entirety was at the time a sort of bible for this \r\nnew genre: songs like \"Phantom Of The Opera\" and the title track are still today considered huge classics of metal.<p>Being this the first Maiden record, it is at times a little naive and immature, but in other moments it's a monster, a true Heavy Metal \r\nrecord, or at least how a Heavy Metal record should sound like. Paul Di Anno's voice is always appreciable, too bad he left after \r\nKillers. Even though, when the bands' zenit came out, \"The Number Of The Beast\", and Bruce Dickinson replaced him, Di Anno was \r\neasily forgotten, as the new singer's brilliant and innovative voice ruled and fascinated the audience. <p>The structure of the album is very eclectic: the first two songs are powerful tracks that every Maiden fan knows and appreciates, \r\n\"Remember Tomorrow\" is a semi ballad, with some haunting moments mixed with strong and violent ones. \"Running Free\" is a true \r\nhymn to freedom and Heavy Metal, and \"Phantom Of The Opera\" is the biggest classic off this album. Follows the great instrumental \r\n\"Transilvania\", and then another ballad, \"Strange World\", much more mysterious than \"Remember Tomorrow\", but a little less \r\neffective. The two final songs are really good songs, \"Charlot The Harlot\", which started an impressive variety of related songs \r\nlyrically speaking, that are focused on a fictional character created by guitarist Dave Murray. The final track is the title track, a pretty \r\nheavy song with some really crunchy bass and interesting and innovating for the time rhythms, very fast and violent, maybe a sort f \r\nproto trash metal. <p>In conclusion, I must say that I truly enjoyed this album, since the first time I listened to it, and I never get tired of it. An Excellent \r\naddiction for any Metal or Rock fan.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284723#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284723\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284723\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, June 3, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284723)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt began with a whimper for me, the Iron Maiden debut that launched one of the most important \r\nand essential NWOBHM bands is a real let down. The singing is not up to scratch for a start \r\nand I believe once Bruce Dickinson replaced the mediocre vocal talents of Paul Di'Anno, the \r\nband really took off. Come on,you Irons, you can't tell me that 'Phantom of the Opera' was not \r\nimproved once it was covered by Dickinson, who is litrerally like an AIR RAID SIREN such is \r\nthe range of his incredible vocals, thus garnering the nickname 'AIR RAID SIREN'. There are \r\nsome awesome tracks here that are saved by blistering speed lead breaks from the talented \r\nduel guitar virtuosos, Murray and Stratton. Indeed POTO is perhaps the most progressive song \r\non the album and definitely the best thing here.<p>'Running Free' became a powerhouse live and was performed on stage for years to come \r\nfollowing this release. 'Strange World' has a quirky riff and chugs along nicely as does the fun \r\nfilled 'Charlotte the Harlot'. <p>The title track and band name 'Iron Maiden' is of course a quintessetial IM track with anthemic \r\nlyrics and a very strong beat from Burr and the rhythmic bass of Harris. It was the birth of \r\ngreatness but they were yet to reach the heights with \"Number of the Beast\". <p>I remember listening to this debut in the record store, that's right vinyl, and I remember \r\ndistinctly being turned off by the vocals. I had altready purchased TNOTB so it was a turn off to \r\nhear such powerless vocals. I still feel the same way now. 3 stars for sheer musical \r\nexcellence but this is full of throwaway material, and that has all been ignored by Maiden in \r\nconcerts to come as they rose to metal power. The best thing that happened to the band was \r\nrecruiting Dickinson and he became the voice of metal.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289802#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289802\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=289802\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 9, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #289802)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=34470\"><strong>Prog Sothoth</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=34470\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/34470/Wewe.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden's debut is quite an interesting blend of metal, punk and prog. If one were to judge \r\nby the cover alone, the metal tag would spring to mind, or maybe a Misfits style horror punk \r\nimpression would emerge, since that monster's hair is both long and spiky, but it certainly \r\ndoesn't instill one to think \"progressive rock\". But there is prog in this puppy. Good prog too.<p>The key elements are the bouncy and ever busy bass playing of Steve Harris, the abundance \r\nof tempo changes and Paul Di'Anno's vocals. Yeah, during the heavier sections he possesses \r\na punk snarl combined with some vibrato hard rock swagger, but during calm mellower \r\nsections (which this album boasts moreso than a lot of their later output), his singing reminds \r\nme of B.O.C.'s Buck Dharma with a bit more oomph...and that's a good thing.<p>Songs like Prowler, Running Free and Iron Maiden are punkish metal fist bangers that have as \r\nmuch in common with your typical prog rock band's output as actress Grace Park has with \r\nCthulhu's mother visually, but other tracks have a distinctively progressive approach. \r\nRemember Tomorrow jumps between a smooth ballad style and heavy metal with a sudden \r\nfast break in the middle that somehow feels seamless in its transitions. There's no chorus \r\neither, just soft to loud dynamics that's every bit as memorable as any chorus hook could \r\nprovide. Phantom Of The Opera is absolutely progressive metal; it actually sounds more prog-\r\nrelated than most of their later lengthy tracks with a cool trippy section after involving beautiful \r\nmelodic guitar playing followed by Harris hammering solo before the rest of the band joins \r\nand builds up the tension. It's a fantastic number, although Paul doesn't add much to it vocally. \r\nHe's great on Strange World though, a flat out space rock track that doesn't sound like an Iron \r\nMaiden tune at all, except maybe for the guitar solos which compliment the song by being \r\ntasteful and almost trippy. Charlotte The Harlot sort of blends the punk metal with bits of prog \r\npretty sweetly. <p>To be honest, I personally prefer this early era of Iron Maiden the most...there's a raw edge to it \r\ncombined with their prog influences that their more popular later eras lack.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=457990#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=457990\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=457990\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 7, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #457990)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt's time for another review streak since I obviously don't do enough of those!<p>\r\nLet me start things off by laying my cards on the table and admitting that I'm not really a big Iron Maiden fan. This band has been consciously flying under my radar for most of my life and this comes from a personal preference of mine, which is actually pretty hard to achieve here in Sweden. Swedes are generally known for loving their metal music, but there are really few acts that get the same amount of attention as Iron Maiden. Most of their records have become number one hits in our nation  charts and all of their live shows tend to sell out within minute after tickets are released to the public. All of our hard rock/metal radio stations tend to overemphasize on the singles released by Iron Maiden, Metallica and a handful chosen few, which is pretty much the reason why I haven't actively listened to commercial radio since 2002.<p>\r\nI've heard classic albums like <em>The Number Of The Beast</em> and <em>Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son</em> on many occasions all throughout my teen years but little of that has really managed to make an impact on me, same can also be said about Metallica. So why did I start to actively listening to Iron Maiden after all this time? Well, it all began a few month ago when I had my regular Iron Maiden rant in a close circle of friends and one of them suggested that I give the two Paul Di'Anno-era albums a chance before completely bearing any hopes of ever enjoying Iron Maiden. This was an interesting proposal since I have ignored those albums due to their low level of publicity here in Sweden (ince we tend to prefer the Dickinson era).<p>\r\nI began my journey with the band-titled debut album and even though my expectations weren't exactly on top before my first exposure to the material, I actually found it to be an enjoyable album! First thing that really struck me was the great production of the record where every instrument was very distinguishable in the mix. Steve Harris' bass rampage is especially notable here because it often manages to even overshadow the dual guitar attack of Stratton/Murray!<p>\r\nFrom the get-go we are treated to some of the finest tracks of this early Iron Maiden era where <em>Prowler</em> and <em>Sanctuary</em> possess an energy to them that even some of the strongest epics from Dickinson era could never achieve. It's basically this raw energy that makes this album the strong statement that it is and the band continues to surprise me by actually preforming two fine ballads with <em>Remember Tomorrow</em> and <em>Strange World</em>. The latter is often being considered the weakest track of this fine record, but I happen to disagree with that statement. I'm actually really surprised that Iron Maiden didn't indulge further into this direction with their consecutive albums since their ballads work so well here.<p>\r\nOverall, it hard to go wrong when you've got an album filled with classics like <em>Running Free</em>, <em>Phantom Of The Opera</em>, <em>Transylvania</em> and the renown fan favorite <em>Iron Maiden</em>! I know that <em>Charlotte The Harlot</em> is considered somewhat of a classic among the fans, since it spawned a storyline that would be continued on the future albums, but I honestly never liked its simplistic Heavy Metal approach that lacks in every other department.

The raw production and Paul Di'Anno's no-frills shout lends itself \r\nwell to highlighting the faster, punkish side of the band on songs like Prowler and the title track, \r\nwhilst quiet ballads incorporating loud and heavy interjections such as Remember Tomorrow \r\nand Strange World show a strong Judas Priest influence, bearing a strong resemblance to \r\nPriest songs in a similar vein such as Here Come the Tears.<p>However, the track that really points the way to the band's future is The Phantom of the Opera, \r\nwhich combines a prog-rock influenced song structure with a lyrical concept ripped from \r\nliterature and a musical delivery which perfectly balances the drama and theatricality \r\ndemanded by the concept with the balls-out aggression characteristic of this album at its best. \r\nThe classic Iron Maiden sound had not completely taken shape at this point, but it's in songs \r\nsuch as Phantom of the Opera where it can be heard the clearest, and despite the lack of the \r\nband's best-loved vocalist and one of its most talented guitarists it's a great listen which holds \r\nup well against their future classics.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=563946#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=563946\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=563946\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, November 7, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #563946)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=22970\"><strong>Conor Fynes</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=22970\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/22970/30451_10150198165215024_781110023_13173148_4731438_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> 'Iron Maiden' - Iron Maiden (7/10) </strong><p>I once spoke with another Iron Maiden fan who told me that he counted 1982's \"Number of \r\nthe Beast\" as the band's 'true' debut. To him, Maiden couldn't be Maiden without Bruce \r\nDickinson's trademark vocals. Of course, by the time Bruce had joined the gang, Iron \r\nMaiden were already running wild with potential. True enough, Dickinson's quasi-operatic \r\ntenor is now one of the band's most distinctive qualities, but this debut- and its sequel \r\n\"Killers\"- still hold up well. Even before they had truly made their mark on heavy metal, \r\nMaiden were already rocking.<p>I was first introduced to DiAnno-era Maiden through the mini-epic \"Phantom of the Opera\". \r\nNow a longtime favourite of mine, it's easily enough to foster some sort of interest in the \r\nband's early work. Especially regarding this track, it's not surprising that it took Steve Harris \r\nsuch a long time to find musicians willing to pursue this then-relatively progressive and \r\ntechnical brand of heavy metal. Fusing galloping rhythms with guitar harmonies and the \r\natmosphere of progressive rock, \"Phantom of the Opera\" is a certain foreshadowing of what \r\nwould later come for the band. Add in the trademark literature-based lyrics and you have a \r\nclassic Maiden song, in spite of Smith and Dickinson's absence. Before even discussing \r\nthe rest of the album, it's enough that one of the band's best songs is here.<p>\"Phantom of the Opera\" is above and beyond the most complex piece of music on \"Iron \r\nMaiden\", but the band gives a touch of sophistication to their aggression throughout the \r\nalbum. It's true that there is a sense of punk-ishness in large part thanks to the pummelling \r\nrhythm, but Steve Harris' progressive influences are in plain sight. Particularly on the eerie \r\n\"Remember Tomorrow\", Maiden divulge a sense of atmospherics that I've rarely heard in a \r\nNWOBHM act. On the other hand, there's raw carnage to be experienced in \"Running Free\" \r\nand the upbeat title track. One of the most common criticisms of this album is that Iron \r\nMaiden had not completely found their 'sound' yet, but in spite of the lineup differences, \r\nthese guys seem ot have had a firm idea of where they wanted to go musically.<p>Naturally, Paul DiAnno's vocal performance will be the sorest part for Maiden fans, if only for \r\nthe fact that he ain't Brucey. For one, he's certainly not as brilliant a vocalist as Bruce is, yet \r\nhis carefree, almost brutish approach to singing works well for the rawer sound Iron Maiden \r\nwere bringing at this point. I imagine the 'rawness' will turn off some of the band's softer, or \r\nmore progressively inclined fans, but it brings a more organic sound to their music than \r\nmost of their following studio work. The production is a real highlight on \"Iron Maiden\", in \r\nspite of the fuzzy distortion and busy performance, things come through feeling warm and \r\n'in-your-face'. The best way I might describe the production is that this sounds most suited \r\nfor the atmosphere of a small club show, whereas \"Number of the Beast\" onwards gives \r\nthe impression of a bombastic arena affair.<p>It's obviously nowhere near as 'matured' or 'realized' as the Iron Maiden they would become \r\nwith later albums, but this debut should not be discredited by fans or newcomers. Although \r\nthe band we know nowadays as Iron Maiden only shares two members with this \r\nincarnation, the signature sound and style is here, not to mention that \"Phantom of the \r\nOpera\" still stands as one of their greatest compositions.

My friends' older \r\nbrothers were bringing home all this hard rock and heavy metal and I found it really \r\nappealed to me. I remember my friend playing me some tracks from Number of the Beast \r\nand I was seriously hooked. But at the age of 12, my income was limited to a weekly real \r\nestate paper delivery that paid only $25 a month and cassettes were usually $9.99. \r\nHowever, it's thanks to my meagre budget (and the fact that my mother insisted that I put \r\nmost of the money in the bank) that I was forced to buy cheaper cassettes ($6.99 to $7.99) \r\nand that is how my first Iron Maiden purchase came to be not Number of the Beast but their \r\ndebut, Iron Maiden.<p><p>For a 12-year-old, the shorter tracks were the easier ones to absorb and get into: Prowler, \r\nSanctuary, Running Free, Charlotte the Harlot, and Iron Maiden. The simple song formula, \r\nthe heavy metal guitars... if there was anything progressive about these songs it went \r\nstraight over my head. Hey, I was into heavy metal, not progressive rock. I hadn't ever even \r\nheard of progressive rock.<p><p>But there was something there in those longer songs that captured my attention. \r\nRemember Tomorrow had slow parts that weren't sappy. The bass guitar stood out. The \r\nelectric guitars were mellow but effective at creating an atmosphere. The drums were subtle \r\nand controlled when necessary. Then there was the heavy chorus and rapid-paced solo \r\npart that abruptly stepped on the breaks and brought the song back down to the slow pace \r\nfor the chorus. The change in dynamics appealed to me.<p><p>Then there was Phantom of the Opera. What an unusual song! Mostly an instrumental, this \r\nwas not a lengthy jam session or guitar solo indulgence but rather a song that was crafted \r\nafter a symphonic fashion. It was heavy metal but I could imagine a symphony orchestra \r\nperforming this music (OK, at 12 years of age I didn't imagine this - I was probably closer to \r\nthe age of 17 by that time). How many other bands were composing instrumental passages \r\nthat were about the melody and building on the music rather than just music to support a \r\nguitar solo? Black Sabbath Volume 4, which I also procured for a cheap price at this time, \r\ncame to mind.<p><p>Then how about the instrumental Transylvania, a kind of continuation of the Phantom of the \r\nOpera vein, segued into the melodic and mysterious Strange World? This was again metal \r\nwith a symphonic feel composition-wise and a slow song that was not a sugary love song \r\nbut a voyage to some imaginary place that crossed Greek women of ancient times in togas \r\nand holding grapes with an extraterrestrial sea and distant space vessels gleaming in the \r\nsunlight of a pink sky. Well, that wasn't exactly what the lyrics were about but that was the \r\nimage that Strange World gave me and it has stuck ever since.<p><p>I have to say that it is very much thanks to this album that early on I learned to appreciate \r\nthat hard and heavy music didn't have to be all AC/DC and Van Halen or a four-minute, ass-\r\nkicking like Judas Priest's Screaming for Vengeance and some tracks off Black Sabbath's \r\nMob Rules. Because I encountered this creative approach to heavy music early on it was \r\neasy for me to appreciate the genius of Deep Purple and Uriah Heep, or pick out the \r\nbrilliance of Metallica's Master of Puppets. Iron Maiden by Iron Maiden taught me that heavy \r\nmetal could be compositionally creative and expansive, not just about energy and technical \r\nskill.<p><p>I give it four stars for the four longer songs I mentioned above. This may not be the taste of \r\nmany prog heads but if you are OK with progressive metal then I think this album holds \r\nsome great examples of some of the early works in true progressive heavy metal.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=798721#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=798721\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=798721\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, August 2, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #798721)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAn impressive beginning for IRON MAIDEN and their mascot Eddie. Already with their first album they\r\nwere catapulting the NWOBHM into new arenas by incorporating not only elements of punk but even more\r\nimportantly those of progressive rock bands.<p>Only two classic members here. Steve Harris and Dave Murray. Dennis Stratton although only appearing\r\non this album and then sacked due to musical incompatibilities nevertheless contributed the use of\r\nWishbone Ash dual guitar melodies that MAIDEN would make their own for their entire career.  <p> \r\nPaul Di'Anno only contributed his vocals to the first two MAIDEN albums but his unique punky vocal\r\nstyle really suits the material here. In fact, although Bruce Dickinson may be the better of the\r\ntwo, Di'Anno has a certain charm that makes the first two albums in their discography stand out.\r\nThis debut has always been on the top of my list of favorites.<p>This album has a great diversity of sounds ranging from the punkish tracks like \"Prowler\" and\r\n\"Running Free\" to the slower more cerebral tracks like \"Remember Tomorrow\" and \"Strange World.\" The\r\nreal standout is \"Phantom Of The Opera\" which showed their ability to write extended tracks with\r\nprogressive themes.<p>The band had unexpected success from the getgo in their native UK and soon afterwards in mainland\r\nEurope. This brilliant debut was only a prototype of the even better and more ambitious albums to\r\ncome. Although this is often overshadowed by the greatness of the Dickinson era, I listen to this\r\nalbum regularly as it is a timeless classic that I simply can't get enough of. 4.5 rounded up</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1117017#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1117017\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1117017\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, January 20, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1117017)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nLike many others, I avoided this debut by Iron Maiden for a long time because it doesn't feature Bruce \r\nDickenson on vocals. Bruce is a freaking legend, rightfully one of the most respected front-men and vocalist in \r\nall of rock history... but it's easy to forget that so much of what makes Iron Maiden a great band is the \r\ninstrumental work and song writing going on all around his antics and wails. Iron Maiden the album shows off \r\nthe group's band-centric nature excellently, with the early lineup pounding out well-crafted hard rock/metal with \r\nsavage gusto and ambition. And DiAnno's vocals are pretty great after all!<p>The album opens very strongly with \"Prowler,\" making it apparent that Iron Maiden isn't just a noisy punk or \r\nthrash group. The instrumental work is precise and energetic, and thanks to an excellent production, we can \r\nhear every note of it. Harris' iconic bass stands out powerfully (not quite galloping yet).<p>\"Remember Tomorrow\" shows the group striving for creativity and tone, with a thoughtful beginning that builds \r\nand builds to blistering crescendo of riffs and power chords. Very strong, very effective. The slow and quite intro \r\nto this song also shows the band playing softer than I think they ever have, with the exception of the mid-point \r\nto \"Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.\" <p>There's a fair load of more straight forward rockers, such as \"Sanctuary,\" \"Charlotte the Harlot,\" and \"Running \r\nFree,\" but the standout tracks of \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Transylvania\" are legitimate highlights in the \r\nband's library. \"Phantom\" especially; it's a dynamic and instrumental piece which, while not so complex as \r\nsome of the instrumentals of the bands that they've inspired (such as Dream Theater), is probably more \r\neffective. Unfortunately the guitar work by Murray and Stratton isn't up to the same level that we'd hear later with \r\nMurray and Smith, and the drumming is pretty forgettable. However, Iron Maiden the album keeps its emphasis \r\non composition, which keeps the lackluster soling to a minimum. <p>The album as a whole has a throaty rawness which hints at the band's metal or punk club origins, but don't let it \r\nfool you. There's a lot of exciting stuff going on here. Fans of Maiden need to listen to this simply for historical \r\nvalue, and hard rock listeners in general well find a lot to like, even if you're turned off by Iron Maiden the \r\nband's later offerings.<p>Recommended!<p>Songwriting: 3 - Instrumental Performances: 3 - Lyrics/Vocals: 3 - Style/Emotion/Replay: 4</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1477943#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1477943\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1477943\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 20, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12923#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1477943)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=21556\"><strong>DamoXt7942</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=21556\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/21556/KEISHIRO_BY_EETU.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAmazing connection with various rock subgenre elements, they had (and have).<p>This album can be thought as one of the vanguards that merge punk, hardcore, (so-called) progressive, and especially pop, into heavy \r\nmetal basis. Yes we should consider the reason they would have got to be a popular combo all over the world. Like to say that pop / \r\nmelodious hard rock might be one of their early strategies for splashing their creation out into the worldwide rock scene in 1980s. Their \r\nmethodological heavy riffs should addict us so slowly, gradually as if we might continue getting little poisonous liquid again and again or \r\nget a bunch of body blows.<p>Their artistic methods can be summarized and condensed into one of their masterpieces here \"Phantom Of The Opera\", we can get \r\nnotified. Not only massive drumming expansion or violently explosive guitar sound bullets along with uptempo verse-chorus-interlude-\r\nverse-chorus repetitions but also intentional irregular rhythmical alterations via theatrical variations can be heard ... we must get \r\nsurprised and amazed in such a musical development over 3 decades ago! Nope they were too innovative to avoid such an approach for \r\nmetal freaks.<p>Anyway it's so cool to know their ballad number \"Strange World\" be beautiful and flowery, psychedelic, enough blended with hard, \r\nmetallic sound delight.
