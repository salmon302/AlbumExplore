Proggish! \r\nMaybe too early to judge yet but i'd say many of the tracks on this album show the  \r\nLundun boys with a new lease of life and would stand up  very strongly to anything \r\non \"Number of the Beast\" - how's that?\r\nThere is an almost \"Celtic\" flavour here and there, such as \"Pilgrim\" and did i detect a \r\nZeppelinesque eastern feel on \"The Pilgrim\" ?? The opening tracks \"Different Worlds\" \r\nand \"These Colours Don't Run\" are CLASSIC Maiden, all their signatures are there, heavy \r\ncrunching riffs, great hooks and time changes,  with amazing vitality. There are very \r\ncatchy riffs on all the tracks, hard to pick a favourite though \"Brighter.....\" (epic!), \"Pilgrim\" \r\nand \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" stand out, the pace hardly lets up throughout \r\nthe album apart from a few  \"breathers\", young Bruce sounds so different when loud and \r\nquiet don't 'e?, hardly believe it's the same geezer! Third spin and the album is growing on \r\nme as fast as a nettle rash,  highly recommended, an essential addition to any collection of \r\nProg Related...or...er....Prog Metal??? who knows.....\"only time will tell!\" <p>\r\nMUSIC RATING 4/5  PROG RATING 3/5</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93084#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93084\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93084\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93084)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10195\"><strong>Queen By-Tor</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10195\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10195/reefer-madness1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>Another reincarnation of Iron Maiden</B><p>This album follows it's predecessors like <I>Dance Of Death</I> and <I>Brave New World</I> with it's \r\nsound. The songs are longer, better put together, and all in all have a better sound. \r\nReally, the band has simply continued the sound they seemed to have put on hiatus \r\nafter their <I>Seventh Son...</I> album. This new Maiden is more up with the times without \r\nappealing to the mainstream. Even the first single was deemed to long to make charts, \r\nbut still scored big with the fans.<p>We start with a sheer rocker, <B>Different World</B>. While it does sound awfully familiar to \r\nthe openers of the last albums (<I>Wildest Dreams, Wicker Man</I>), it is still a good song to \r\nbang your head to. The guitar hasn't been better and Bruce even pulls a fast one on us \r\nby having an oddly melodic chorus instead of a chaotic one familiar to us maiden fans.<p>The next song starts the main theme of the album (which is, of course, war). <B>These \r\nColours Don't Run</B> can be compared to <I>Ghost of the Navigator</I> from the <I>Brave New World</I> \r\nalbum, in structure anyways. This song is a bit harder to get into, and at some points \r\nmakes the audience feel like it shouldn't be able to get into it.<p><B>Brighter Than A Thousand Suns</B> is much the same, hard to get into. Clocking at over 8 \r\nminutes with heavy riffs, fairly repetitive choruses, this song is fairly menacing. But \r\nwhat Maiden music isn't? After you're able to see the direction the band was taken on \r\ntracks like this you're better able to listen to this song, making it very very well done.<p><B>The Pilgrim</B> is another short rocker, giving us a small break from the almost overwhelming \r\nprevious two tracks. It's not as well put together as the last tracks, but this is mainly \r\nbecause it's shorter in length, and short songs are often hard to make as good as their \r\nlonger counterparts. All in all, however, another enjoyable heavy song.<p><B>The Longest Day</B> is one of the standouts of the album. It, like most other songs on this \r\nalbum, starts slow and finishes fast, while keeping a fairly mid paced air about it. This \r\nsong again refers to the album's main theme, and once again, is not very \r\napproachable, albeit, this one more so than the last. This one's more catchy than the \r\nrest, whether this is a strength or a weakness I suppose is up to you.<p>Every album needs a low point, and I suppose <B>Out Of The Shadows</B> is this album's. It is \r\nthe most approachable song on this album, but that is only because it is very \r\nrepetitive, very basic, core rock. Yes, it is a good track, but to me it doesn't fit in with \r\nthe complexities of the rest of it's brother songs. This track sounds too commercial in \r\nsome senses, but that's not it's biggest downfall in the end.<p><B>The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg</B> was a strange choice for a lead single, being as \r\nlong as \"uncatchy\" as it is. in the end, that's what makes this song. It starts eerily, \r\nleads into a long rock segment and ends eerily. What's so appealing about this track is \r\nthat it's more experimental than other Maiden singles (<I>2 Minutes To Midnight</I>, for \r\nexample). Really, it was a strange choice as a single, but it is probably one of the \r\nstrongest tracks the album has to offer.<p>If there was a title track to the album this would be it. <B>For The Greater Good Of God</B> is \r\na hard hitting song that states the underlying premise of the album and throws the \r\ntheme right back at you again. It's structure is near perfect, and though it's the longest \r\nsong on the album you'd never know it after you get lost in the sonic barrage that is \r\nthis song. Another very strong track.<p><B>The Lord Of Light</B> always seemed short to me, being between two 9 minute songs. It is, \r\nof course, long than Reincarnation..., but I guess we tend to forget these things. \r\nAnyways, this is a song reminiscent of the <I>Dance of Death</I> album, both in story and \r\nsound. A nice revisit to the past if you're a fan of that album. (I for one am.)<p>The coda of the album is probably the strongest Maiden track ever recorded. <B>The \r\nLegacy</B> is probably what landed Maiden on this website, as it is very proggy. Looking \r\nfor a prog track, you found it. With powerful vocals, lyrics and instrumentation alike this \r\ncould be Maiden's crowning glory. But I guess you'll have to listen for yourself.<p>All in all a strong offering. In some cases, yes, this album is very hard to get into. The \r\nsound is unapproachable, as I've said many times, but once you're in, you're in. One \r\nthing maiden could have done better on this album would have been to leave in their \r\navant gard song writing and story telling as they've had on albums such as <I>Dance of \r\nDeath, Virtual XI, Seventh Son...</I>, and <I>Somewhere In Time</I>. One thing that pulls me \r\naway from labeling it as maiden's absolute best is the fact that the album almost gets \r\nlost in it's theme, and doesn't give us any of that fantasy maiden goodness. This album \r\nis very very down to earth. Which, ultimately, is good and bad. Still an excellent addition to your collection. 4 stars!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93434#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93434\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93434\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 5, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93434)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nYeah . Iron Maiden is back now with new album (2006) : \"A Matter of Life and Death\".\r\nAs the CD is produced locally at my country, I purchased the Cd at first release\r\ncouple of weeks ago. This fact proves that there are many die hard fans of Iron\r\nMaiden. I have seen it with my own eyes when i-Rock! conducted regular jamming\r\nsession, on last month event there was band that covered Iron Maiden who really burnt\r\nthe venue! I myself not a die-hard fan but I can enjoy most of  Iron Maiden's music. <p>For me personally, this is an excellent album where the roots of Iron Maiden's music\r\nin 80s can be heard from this album. Most tracks are written beautifully in\r\npractically straight forward rock music with triple guitars. Most tracks were written\r\nby Steve Harris and co-written with Bruce Dickinson, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers.\r\nThe music flows excellently to my ears from the opening track \"Different World\"\r\n(straight rock) to \"These Colours Don't Run\" (rock with quite dynamic style) and then\r\nto the rest of tracks. I especially enjoy the triple guitar work the band offers here.<p>One track that can be considered as prog track is \"For The Greater Good of God\"\r\n(9:24). It reminds me really to \"Rhime of The Ancient Mariner\" of Powerslave album.\r\nThe music flows wonderfully with Steve Harris bass guitar forms the basic rhythm\r\nsection augmented with multi-layered guitar sounds. Steve is I think one of great\r\nbass players in rock music. Bruce Dickinson voice is powerful and pretty clear during\r\nthe course of the song. <p>Overall, this is an excellent hard rock music album with some prog elements. Keep on\r\nrockin' ..!<p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=95892#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=95892\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=95892\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, October 27, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #95892)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4373\"><strong>Tom Ozric</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=4373\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/4373/image.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHaving just acquired this new IM album as double pic-disc LP for a Christmas present, I am \r\nlistening to it attentively, and comparing and contrasting it with the previous releases.  It \r\nkind of has a 'business as usual' feel to it ;  the same formula of quiet intros, 'galloping' \r\nrhythms, tempo changes (Maiden trademarks, I guess)....so it looks like its just another \r\nMaiden album, a sure-fire winner, with the band not taking many risks, but this is only \r\nsuperficial. The sound is little raw - quite similar to the sound of 'Number of the Beast' but \r\nheavier.  The album possibly takes some of the stronger elements from the previous two \r\nalbums and incorporates them into the new compositions on this release.  Quite a number \r\nof tracks are credited to Smith/Dickinson/Harris, with the masterpiece, epic closing \r\ntrack, 'The Legacy', credited to Gers/Harris, proving that Gers has come a long way since \r\nhis days as guitarist in the band 'Gillan'.<p>\r\nOpening with an out-'n'-out rocker, 'Different World', nothing really special with this one, a \r\nsong that's very close in structure and mood to 'The Wicker Man',  'These Colours Don't \r\nRun' is a decent, mid-length track, 'Brighter Than a Thousand Suns' is the first 'big' track \r\nand a mighty one at that - full of tempo changes, chunky riffs (even a nice riff in '7'), a \r\nvery strong piece indeed.  'The Pilgrim' has an eastern sounding riff, and is a quality \r\nMaiden track, 'The Longest Day' is very good - it starts and finishes with a moody section, \r\nhas a catchy chorus, but an impressive instrumental passage soon puts thing right.  'Out of \r\nthe Shadows' is a rare IM ballad, harkening back to 'Wasting Love' - its similarity is \r\nundeniable, whilst not the most exciting song here, still gives one a 'breather', for the most \r\nengaging tracks are to follow. <p>\r\n'The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg' is the only contribution from Dave Murray (with help \r\nfrom Harris, of course) and is excellent - starting out quite dark and mysterious,  the main \r\nsection features a great melody and solo (Murray, at a guess) and again finishing how the \r\nsong began.  'For The Greater Good of God' is the longest track (9.24) and is superb, with \r\never-shifting tempos, awesome melodies and riffs and an intense vocal from Dickinson.  \r\nSome quite impressive guitar soloing during the instrumental passage is worth paying \r\nattention to.  'Lord of Light' again starts out quiet and dark, gets heavy, returns to dark \r\nand quiet, fires up again, solo and ends.  Closest comparison would be to the material \r\nof 'The X Factor'.  'The Legacy' (9.20) is another classic epic, beautifully constructed and \r\narranged.  The first section is highly acoustic (an idea the band don't utilise too often)  \r\ngiving way to some breath-taking progressions and impressive vocals, then the \r\ninstrumental kicks in with the band playing their hearts out, Harris included, and finishes \r\nwith some acoustic strumming.   A well deserved 4 stars, and they also bettered their last \r\nrelease, 'Dance of Death'.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104488#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104488\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=104488\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, December 25, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #104488)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nYet another strong and sophisticated album from Iron Maiden. They keep getting better\r\nand better! This is in my opinion their strongest album, tied with the debut and\r\n\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". The style of the album is a combination of Dance of\r\nDeath and X-Factor, making this album their proggiest in my opinion, and one of their\r\ndarkest. The production is a slight letdown, but not enough to annoy the listener.\r\nMost of the songs are somewhat long, but not enough to bore the listeners. I do not\r\nthink that this album has 'filler'.<p>\r\n<strong> Different World </strong> begins the album as the typical straight ahead rocker like\r\nWicker Man or Aces High. Nothing too special but never dull or irritating. <strong> These\r\nColours Don't Run </strong> begins with an inspired mellow acoustic intro and develops\r\ninto a dynamic mid-lengthed Iron Maiden song with time changes, extended instrumental\r\nsection, strings, and effective double guitars. <strong> Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\r\n</strong> is a menacing, multi-segmented epic with beautiful heavy riffs and solos, making\r\nit the heaviest song of the album. <strong> The Pilgrim </strong> is an enjoyable rocker with\r\nan eastern feel, and a main guitar riff that recalls Led Zeppelin. <strong> The Longest\r\nDay </strong> is a mid-paced epic with a catchy chorus and a very memorable guitar riff\r\nplaying during the verses. The instrumental section sounds a bit like Dream Theater\r\nwithout the keyboards, very technical. <strong> Out of the Shadows </strong> is a lighter song,\r\nalmost like a ballad with electric guitar in parts. A very pleasant listen and a\r\nbreak from the heavier songs. <strong> The Reincarnation </strong> is a song where its riffs\r\nare the best element about it. Like most songs here, it starts softly. The vocal\r\nperformance is very good here. <strong> The Greater Good of God </strong> is slightly\r\nrepetitive, but the musicianship is great, the chorus very memorable (guitar and\r\nvocal-wise), the other chorus where the title of the song is chanted has a great\r\nguitar riff, and it has a great instrumental section too. <strong> Lord of Light </strong> is a\r\ntypical mid-lengthed Iron Maiden song that could have been in their previous album,\r\nnot a highlight, but not weak either.<p><strong> The Legacy </strong> is the highlight of the album along with \"Brighter Than A\r\nThousand Suns\". Again, i think of Dream Theater here. The acoustic part I mean. While\r\nthis song doesn't have Dickinson's vocals on par, the acoustic introduction is as\r\neffective as the one in \"Dance of Death\". It is a symphony of acoustic guitars, the\r\nfast paced theme being very beautiful. Also, the epic riff uses wonderful chord\r\nprogressions, and sounds dramatic when they put the other layers in it. The rest of\r\nthe song is heavy metal and has excellent songwriting and musicianship. The ending\r\nbrings back the acoustic guitars and a very powerful last chord that ends the album.<p>Iron Maiden keeps getting better and better. I highly recommend this album to fans of\r\nprog metal.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106689#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106689\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=106689\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, January 8, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #106689)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4892\"><strong>laplace</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=4892\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/4892/jemnez2.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt's been a while since Iron Maiden redefined the heart of metal, but here we are again.<p>The first two tracks are typical sloganeering, propulsive Maiden - good fun, and no\r\ndoubt the proverbial olive branch offered to their long term fans. The first track,\r\n\"Different World\" actually has a tired mid-section that sounds a lot like Guns 'n'\r\nRoses or even Bon Jovi, but luckily this is as close as we come to cheese this time\r\naround.<p>What follows this double-barrelled metal opening is what's really important to us\r\nprog rock fans - eight songs brimming full of progressive references to the likes of\r\nWishbone Ash, Rush and the like (while avoiding the regressive pitfalls associated\r\nwith them); all the tracks are of extended length and Maiden capitalize on this by\r\ndeveloping themes instead of repeating them. Semi-unusual time signatures are\r\nemployed - 7/8 surfaces in \"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\" (a song that also features\r\nthrilling if questionable leaps in tempo) with a lurching intro that blossoms into a\r\nnatural and heavy verse, while other songs evolve past classic metal songwriting by\r\ninvolving A and B sections (think Metallica) and variations upon a song's theme -\r\neven a simple transposition from one key to another is a lovely gesture and one of\r\nthe many reasons why Iron Maiden continue to be considered a step-above your average\r\nheavy metal band. In \"The Longest Day\" you can sense them seizing back the double-axe\r\nmelodic trademark from bands such as Blind Guardian. The best part is that none of\r\nthis filigree ruins the purity or epic qualities of the choruses you'd expect, which\r\nis why this reviewer rewards \"A Matter of Life and Death\" with five stars...<p>...personally, that is. Since this is not a true prog record it doesn't seem\r\ncomfortable or right to assign this any value higher than three. But let's call this\r\na ***+ since, outside of the world of progressive rock, this was the greatest album\r\nreleased in 2006.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=118361#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=118361\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=118361\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 14, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #118361)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=114\"><strong>richardh</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=114\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/114/af5d2032-17c8-4974-b74e-8526b424a141.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI've been giving this a lot of play on my in-car CD play recently.Maiden have been a class \r\nabove the opposition for some years with a style that sends them very close to prog if not \r\nexactly diving in head first.Here they explore some contemporary ideas with the occasional \r\nnods to Dream Theater and Tool and with less of the full on metal that was more their \r\ntrademark in the early days.I really like the meaty production and Nicko has never sounded \r\nbetter behind the drums for my money.The songs are all around the 6-7 minute mark..well \r\ndeveloped but not overdone.This is classy stuff and one of the most enjoyable albums I've \r\nlistened to for a long time.I'll leave it up to you to decide whether its ''prog'' or not but for \r\nme its a safe 5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=118779#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=118779\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=118779\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, April 18, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #118779)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n With satisfaction I start to write my last review in my series of Iron Maiden's albums. I've covered all records since THE NUMBER \r\nOF THE BEAST and maybe one day, when I have enough money to throw away in cd's I already know I'll very rarely hear, I'll get \r\nthe two first, Paul D'Anno-fronted albums and give my opinions on them. For now, let's rest. <p>DANCE OF DEATH was not a great album. After three great consecutive releases, the Irons couldn't keep on track and delivered \r\na so-so record that lacked in melodies, good choruses or memorable instrumental sections. Though the music was still OK, it was a \r\nhuge step down from the glories of BRAVE NEW WORLD. Even Dickinson sounded a little bit uninspired in the 2003 album, \r\nrepeating himself, as did the whole band. <p>A MATTER OF LIFE AN DEATH is a return to form of sorts for Iron Maiden. It's not as brilliant as the earlier albums, but it's much \r\nbetter than it's predecessor. From a progressive standpoint, it may be one of their most progressive albums to date, picking up \r\nwhere they left at in BRAVE NEW WORLD. The retro-sounds of DANCE OF DEATH have all but disappeared and we're once again \r\nin the company of a band playing music that looks into the future. Let's talk about the songs. <p> Different World (9.5/10) Now we're talking! Pure energy, pure vitality, this is the kind of opener I've always come to expect from \r\nmy Maiden. A great riff, full speed but with melody, and an unusual chorus sung by all the voice in a low key, not typical of \r\nMaiden, more melodic than heroic, but very good nevertheless. Yes, what happened in the previous album was just the \r\nexception to the rule. A great first track. The Beast has risen again. \r\n <p> These Colours Don't Run (8.5/10) The guitars and the bass open this track in a haunting mood. A melodic start that can stick on \r\nour mind. When the main verse starts, it's the same melody but with full force. Dickinson's back on track again, sounding as the \r\npowerhouse that he's usually been. The chorus is slower and while not fantastic, is good, better than the forgettable choruses in \r\nDANCE OF DEATH. The middle section with a relentless rhythm and synth help enhance this track and make it feel more epic, \r\neven more so when the traditional Maiden <em>chants</em> appear near the end.<p> Brighter Than a Thousand Suns (9.5/10) An atmospheric start leads the way towards a very Queensryche-like main riff. The \r\nverse is more metallic than anything Maiden has done as of late, sounding more like progressive-metal than the typical Iron \r\nMaiden heavy-metal with prog elements. The second section that precedes the chorus is sung by Dickinson at the top of his \r\nlungs. After a repeat of both sections, we get the chorus; it kicks off very quietly, but grows into a powerful, desperate cry from \r\nDickinson sounding as good as ever. A fantastic song. <p> The Pilgrim (8.5/10) Drums kick off this track. The main verse is very fast, then the chorus is, like the one in the first song, sung \r\nin a low register and volume, but very good anyway. A few eastern-flavored melodies serve as bridge between sections. \r\nAnother success. <p> The Longest Day (8/10) An atmospheric start that reminds us of THE X-FACTOR. The opening lines could've been sung by \r\nBayley, though we can't say the same about what unfolds, where only the powerful chest of Dickinson could live up to the \r\nenergy and demands of the Iron machinery. The chorus is a little odd, good but not brilliant. A good song, somewhat in the same \r\nlevel as the epics in DANCE OF DEATH: enjoyable but not memorable. <p> Out of the Shadows (7.5/10) This song starts quietly, Dickinson singing very melodically. The beginning is the best part of the \r\nsong, as it gets lost just like many of the tracks in the previous album did. Good. <p> The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg (7/10) Another start that could've sung by Bayley, very quiet and in a low register. The \r\ndifference is how Dickinson can actually sing a different melody than what the guitars are playing. The main riff is, again, very \r\nprog-metal, a la Queensryche (as I said a million times, Maiden revisits its own music, it's full-circle influence here). The tracks is \r\nnot memorable, but a good listen. Only the middle section makes it stand out somewhat. <p> For the Greater Good of God (9/10) A somber beginning; Maiden continues to travel progressive waters. Then Dickinson appears \r\nand sings a great melody, this doesn't sound retro at all. Everything grows more restless and then the epic chorus attacks; the \r\nguitars help make this feel rather heroic. After a few average songs, The Beast gives us another excellent short-epic. <p> Lord of Light (7.5/10) After the melodic, pensive beginning, the music gets rather typical for Maiden, though nobody could \r\naccuse Dickinson of uninspired singing. Great playing by all the musicians, the track is not remarkable but enjoyable. <p> The Legacy (9.5/10) The opening acoustic lines are great, with Dickinson marvelously flowering over them. A very progressive \r\nstart. After a brief pause, we hear doubt, the guitar doesn't know whether to attack or to play a tuneful melody. A fantastic \r\nopening that stands out from almost any other in this album. The synth dominates the sound, this is almost full-blown prog-metal. \r\nThe chorus is sung over acoustic guitars, synth, very atmospheric, and with the voices following the descending riff from the \r\nguitars. Very, very good. Halfway down Maiden interrupts all this progressiveness with a 100% Iron Maiden moment that takes \r\nus back to the POWERSLAVE years. \"The Legacy\" is, as of today, a great legacy that the Beast has left us, chessy pun intended. <p> My final word: a great album, with some weaker tracks that bring the rating down a notch, but full of great moments and, \r\nspecially, very progressive in nature. A great comeback after the slightly-above-average DANCE OF DEATH. <p>Recommended for: Iron Maiden fans, fans of Progressive metal, fans of good metal and good hard rock in general.<p>. this makes me wait anxiously for the next album. Until then, this series has been a pleasure to review. We'll wait for the 15th \r\nof The Beast. \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=128131#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=128131\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=128131\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, July 11, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #128131)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nA very polished and finely produced release from one of my favorite metal bands, featuring what many fans will find to be some of \r\nthe band's most interesting and dynamic compositions to date-- especially in songs like \"Brighter Than a Thousand \r\nSuns\", \"Reincarnation of BBreeg\" and the sweeping \"Great Good of God\".  Of all the members, I was most impressed by Nicko \r\n(drums) and Steve (bass), who in my opinion deliver their finest performances; the iconic guitar work is surprisingly lacking \r\nthroughout, at least in the solo department-- although the listener can easily hear the added complexity in most of the instrumental \r\nsections which are spread across all of the lengthy, usually epeic songs.<p>\"Life and Death\" is likely the band's most ambitious album to date, and it doesn't disappoint.

Let's hope that \"Different World\" \r\nwill set the pace for this work.<p>The journey has been quite long since their first and excellent \"Iron Maiden\" album (1980). IMHHO, the band never released a \r\npoor album, even if \"No Prayer For The Dying\" was probably their weakest one (two stars).<p>As during all their albums, prog will be hard to find. All tracks are seriously metal oriented here, but we all know that it was their \r\nstyle and nothing else, right? <p>And when one listens to \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" there is absolutely nothing than an reinforcement of this FACT. But \r\nwhile the band was rather creative during his long numbers (epics?), I have to say that this one only sits shy to the great \"Rime \r\nOf The Ancient Mariner\", \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\" or even \"Alexander The Great\" to name a few. A good number with \r\nsome great guitar moments, but no more.<p>The Oriental mood during \"The Pilgrim\" is rather unexpected and brings this otherwise average song to a stronger level. But the \r\nmiddle part of this album is a little weaker. The archetype of the heavy metal genre is featured during \"The Longest Day\". The \r\nballad \"Out Of The Shadows\" sounding as a poor AOR tune out of the eighties. Strange because the band didn't fall into this trap \r\nvery often in their long career.<p>I can't really say that this is a great album. Even \"Dance Of Death\" (their previous album) was better IMO. \"A Matter Of Life And \r\nDeath\" holds nothing else than average numbers. Over-extended and somewhat useless, unfortunately (\"The Reincarnation Of \r\nBenjamin Breeg\"). They just sound as an average heavy metal band, and to be honest they were much, much better than that.<p>The Maiden will try hard to cope with their brilliant past and will deliver more long songs in this album than on any previous album. \r\nBut long is not always a guarantee of great, even if \"For The Greater Good Of God\" is another killer song. One of the best of this \r\nwhole offering (with the opening number).<p>Almost ten minutes of the most vigorous beat, and the power of those three guitars are quite an experience. They work quite \r\nwell together but the attempts to a solo are not convincing. But this is probably the problem of this album : no real highlights to \r\nbe found.<p>A few good songs, but this is not enough to fill over seventy minutes of music. As such, it is longish, uniform and a bit dull. If you \r\nare fully in heavy metal, maybe that you will appreciate this album more than I do.<p>I'm afraid that two stars is the max I can rate this album. And The Legacy is not good enough to turn it higher.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=157852#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=157852\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=157852\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, January 5, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #157852)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15928\"><strong>progrules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15928\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15928/cover_1325619920091.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAbout a year ago I bought many Iron Maiden albums because they were for sale and because the band is on our site which made it possible to review them all. I only owed one album at that point, one I already possessed as a vinyl and that was Somewhere in Time, their album I to date still consider their magnum opus. Right after this in the quality line-up we find Brave new World and Matter of Life and Death, that is measured to my personal taste.<p>And the funny thing is that both last mentioned are from this century which means that Maiden is not dead by a long way for me. It could even be they get better by aging. But I don't want to go that far just yet. I will give brief opinions about each song now.<p>Different World is a fine opener but not really one of the better of the album. 3,25*. <p>These Colours don't Run is a much better effort and is indeed one of the better. 4*.<p>Brighter than a thousand Suns goes on in the same strong way and is even better than previous. One of the highlights. 4,25*.<p>The Pilgrim is like the opener one of the lesser and I believe it's no coincidence that it's also one of the shorter tracks (like 1st). 3,5*. <p>The Longest Day is bringing things on the right track again and is another cracker. 4,25*.<p>Out of the Shadows is a slower paced track, almost a ballad. Very good, though not excellent. 3,75*.<p>The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg is in between two previous songs. Almost excellent this time. 4*<p>For the greater Good of God is more epical than former. This time I like the instrumental bits better than the vocal ones. Dickinson does a great job on this album and also on this song. The problem is the chorus though. The solos are once again top notch. 4*.<p>Lord of Light has a light intro but after the first two minutes the band breaks loose once again to do another great performance. 4*.<p>The Legacy is almost an example of \"save the best for last\". Well, I'm not sure if it's the very best track of the album but at least one of the best. 4,25*.<p>\r\nWith Iron Maiden the task is actually to describe the measure of progressiveness because it's a prog related band and their presence on PA is often questioned. Iron Maiden is a hard rock monument that deserves every praise by at least all hard rock and metal fans but that's not really the point now. Not every band makes it through the ballot here and therefore I believe the measure of progressiveness is essential. For IM standard this album is progressive enough to deserve its place on this site. It could even be their most progressive album to date. The songs are long, inventive, pretty complex and at least far more than plain hard rock let alone pop.\r\nAnd that's immediately the reason I love this album so much. Overall it could even be a better album than Somewhere in Time but - and then we come to the only slight weakness - contrary to SiT this albums lacks a real highlight. It's a very stable and equable album. One that deserves 4 stars without any reserve.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=163883#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=163883\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=163883\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, March 14, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #163883)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n4.5 stars. An improvement over the previous album \"Dance Of Death\" especially the cover art. Haha. \r\nThis is the most progressive release from MAIDEN since \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\". I can't get \r\nover the variety here, even with Bruce's vocals. I really think they're trying to mix it up a bit more on \r\nthis album and for me it works big time.This album has taken me longer to get into as well compared to \r\ntheir past albums. One complaint is that at 72 minutes it's too long, but when they finish the way they \r\ndo with those last four tracks it's hard to complain.<p>\r\n\"Different World\" is an uptempo rocker and Nicko is all over this one. It's the most straight forward \r\ntrack though. \"These Colours Don't Run\" opens with some atmosphere with Harris adding some \r\nsynths. I like when it picks up and the vocals arrive. More synths after 3 minutes followed by some \r\nripping guitar. \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" is a top three track for me. Like most \r\nsongs it opens in a laid back manner before kicking in. Huge bass when it does as the guitars grind \r\naway. Blistering guitar solo after 3 1/2 minutes. It gets intense a minute later. Some really good \r\ncontrasts on this one between the heavy and more laid back sections. Check out Adrian Smith on the \r\nsynth-guitar after 7 minutes. <p>\"The Pilgrim\" is a fast paced tune with Nicko once again keeping very \r\nbusy. Bruce is giving his all vocally. Nice and heavy with deep bass lines. \"The Longest Day\" is mid \r\npaced to start with a heavy soundscape and vocals with attitude. It kicks into gear but it's not as \r\ndark. These contrasts continue. A killer instrumental section after 4 1/2 minutes. Heavy stuff. \"Out Of The \r\nShadows\" opens with outbursts of drums before it settles with reserved vocals.This is a powerful mid-\r\npaced track that changes 3 1/2 minutes in with some great bass. \"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin \r\nBreeg\" starts slowly as usual before almost spoken words come in just before a minute. It settles then \r\nhere we go ! Check out the rhythm section ! Very cool track. \"For the Greater Good Of God\" opens with \r\nfat bass lines and is very atmospheric. Reserved vocals come in with synths. It kicks in around 1 1/2 \r\nminutes. Great sound ! Amazing sound after 6 minutes as they rip it up. Nice and heavy too. <p>\"Lord Of \r\nLight\" is a top three track for me. It's all pretty reserved until after 1 1/2 minutes then all hell breaks \r\nloose. It settles after 4 minutes as contrast continues. \"The Legacy\" is the other top three tune \r\nalthough \"The Longest Day\" and \"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\" are all right there for me. So \r\nthat's my top five I suppose. The final track starts off with acoustic guitar as reserved vocals come \r\nin.The tempo starts to pick up. It's even fuller after 3 minutes. Check out the guitar after 5 1/2 minutes \r\nthen Harris joins in. Another guitar solo follows and then it ends as it began.<p>\r\nDifficult for me being such a fanboy not to give this five stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=210636#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=210636\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=210636\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, April 6, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #210636)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> is the fourteenth full-length studio album by UK heavy metal \r\nact <B>Iron Maiden</B>. This is the third album release after the band re-united with lead \r\nvocalist <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> and guitarist <B>Adrian Smith</B>. I was very happy about \r\ntheir last album <em>Dance of Death (2003)</em> and my expectations for this album were as a \r\nconsequence very high.<p>The music is no surprise if you\u00b4re familiar with the trademark <B>Iron Maiden</B> sound. \r\nMelodic heavy metal with an epic edge. As on the last couple of albums there are a few faster \r\npaced rockers on the album but most songs are mid-paced and pretty long epic tracks. Songs \r\nlike the strong power ballad <em>Out of the Shadows</em>, the really heavy <em>The Reincarnation \r\nof Benjamin Breeg</em> and my favorite on the album <em>Brighter Than A Thousand Suns</em> \r\nreally prove that <B>Iron Maiden</B> still have lots to offer even after all these years. The guitar \r\nsolos and guitar melody theme work is excellent and <B>Iron Maiden</B> really make full use \r\nof their three guitarists <B>Janick Gers</B>, <B>Dave Murray</B> and <B>Adrian Smith</B>. A \r\nfew times I\u00b4m almost reminded of the multilayered guitar harmonies on <em>...And Justice for All \r\n(1988)</em> by <B>Metallica</B>. The rythm section is as always impressive and tight like hell \r\nand it never cease to amaze me how powerful and commanding <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> \r\nsounds. <p>The production is powerful and really gives the music the right punch. Much like the sound on \r\nits predecessor the sound on <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> really means that this album \r\nsounds heavier than what we\u00b4ve been used to from <B>Iron Maiden</B> in the eighties and in \r\nthe nineties. I really enjoy this newfound heaviness. It makes them sound fresh and inspired.<p><em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> is another great album by <B>Iron Maiden</B>. Their basis \r\nquality level is so extremely high that even though <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> doesn\u00b4t \r\nreally bring anything new to <B>Iron Maiden\u00b4s </B> sound it\u00b4s difficult to rate it with less than a \r\n4 star rating. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=234997#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=234997\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=234997\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, August 25, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #234997)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23199\"><strong>Dobermensch</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23199\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23199/me.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSame old, same old, I'm afraid. How is it possible to have a recording career as long as theirs \r\nand show so few signs of development? Dickinson still has the same old operatic vocal style that \r\nhe's used continuously for 29 years. Fair do's though - he still sounds good. It seems as though \r\nIron Maiden just release the music that's expected of them. \r\nTake any one of their albums from the last 10 years and guaranteed - they all sound \r\nidentical. Still, it's better than the previous 10 years before that. Now there was a grim time for \r\nMaiden fans.<p>I may seem negative towards this LP but I just feel there's so much more they're capable of, as \r\nthey're undoubtedly good musicians.<p>I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe while listening to this. Despite its healthy \r\nrating I find 'A Matter of Life and Death' to be instantly forgettable. There's no new ideas, no 'lets \r\ndo something completely off the wall and unexpected', no tampering or experimentation with \r\nthe guitars, no deviation from the straight drums. Iron Maiden seem to be caught between two \r\nstools. Do they go all out attack or stay safe? It's the latter I'm afraid and safe isn't good enough \r\nthese days.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=510353#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=510353\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=510353\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, August 27, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #510353)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe third in Iron Maiden's extremely consistent run of albums to follow their reunion with Bruce \r\nDickinson finds the band continuing to explore the matured post-Seventh Son of a Seventh \r\nSon sound they have pursued from Brave New World onwards.

I hate to say \r\ngimmick but some selling point, as if they needed that. Of course the return of Bruce Dickenson on vocals was the greatest thing that \r\ncould have happened to Iron Maiden, and with Adrian Smith back in the line-up as well things couldn't have looked better as the band \r\nopened the new millennium. In 2003, 'Dance of Death' was recorded all on analogue tape, and 'A Matter of Life and Death', according \r\nto the Wiki article, was not mastered but just put straight to disc to give it that 'what you hear in the studio' sound. Later came 'The \r\nFinal Frontier', which many thought might be the final Iron Maiden album, and then in 2015 we had Maiden's longest album yet with \r\nan epic song that featured Bruce on piano.<p><p>From my perspective, Iron Maiden spent the first four albums perfecting their sound. What we hear on 'Piece of Mind' is THE Iron \r\nMaiden sound. They added a long composition for their fifth album 'Powerslave', guitar synthesizers for 'Somewhere in Time' and a \r\nconcept album for 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'. After that, I don't know where they went, though I know many felt 'No Prayer for \r\nthe Dying' was substandard and 'Fear of the Dark' was an attempt to keep Iron Maiden in vogue with the grunge scene happening all \r\naround. The Blaze Bailey albums, I don't know about. Perhaps I'll find out one day. I think many people agree, however, that from \r\n'Brave New World' Iron Maiden were back in their soundscope and playing what us old fans love to hear.<p><p>Now honestly, I was not thinking to give this album four stars. After 'The Book of Souls' came out, I was impressed enough to buy the \r\nfour albums from 'Brave New World' and on because I hadn't bought anything since 'Seventh Son'. Each album had some excellent \r\nsongs with all the trademarks of excellent Iron Maiden songs. For a couple of weeks I listened to almost nothing but new Iron Maiden \r\nwith a bit of the old classics thrown in for enjoyment's sake. But as months passed and loads of new music came to me, the thrill of \r\nmany of the songs on this album faded. Recently I put some songs on mixed playlists and I found that I was not as impressed. The \r\nsound was too muddy. Dickenson's vocals were not clear and even sounded weak in parts, like he was straining his voice to keep the \r\nnotes. When a song from this album followed a song from 'Powerslave' I really noticed the difference in recording clarity; 'Powerslave' \r\nsounded just so much better!<p><p>So tonight I cued up 'A Matter of Life and Death' and let it run through my ear buds and I found myself once more pleasantly \r\nsurprised. The sound is a bit thick or muddy at first. I did feel that Bruce Dickenson's vocals don't stand out in the mix as they should. \r\nThe band rocks out with the opening track 'Different World' and 'These Colours Don't Run' is slower but heavy as a Maiden song \r\nshould be. Neither of them warmed my feelings toward the album though because of the recording quality.<p><p>So I notched the volume up one.<p><p>That made a big difference. From here on in, each song delivered things to impress. Some featured excellent heavy riffing like 'Brighter \r\nthan a Thousand Suns' and 'The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg'. And many songs include what I call the Maiden musical journey. \r\nThis is where the band go into an extended instrumental segment that is only partly devoted to guitar solos but is otherwise used for \r\nadding in new rhythms and riffs and changing tempo and meter. In a couple of tracks there were some surprise heavy riff parts like in \r\n'The Longest Day' that don't crop up anywhere else in the songs. And in 'Lord of Light' I was surprised to hear a high wailing sound \r\nthat turned out to be an electric guitar played in a way I've never heard done on a Maiden album. 'The Legacy' has an acoustic guitar \r\nand electric bass intro that I swear touches on renaissance music though I am no expert there at all. Bruce Dickenson still delivers his \r\npowerful vocals, and song after song just seems to sound great, some more so than others.<p><p>Where I feel there might be any reason to be disappointed other than the sound which could have been clearer is basically in the Iron \r\nMaiden formula approach to the song writing. I mean, Maiden established their sound and style over the first four albums and I feel \r\nthat 'A Matter of Life a Death' treads barely any discernable new territory. Why should no mastering of the recording be a big selling \r\npoint? This album is the same as the previous two with some long songs over seven or eight minutes and some shorter ones under six \r\nminutes. There's a standard approach of intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, repeat, instrumental journey interlude, pre-chorus, chorus, \r\nrepeat the song title 8 to 12 times, and return to the intro to wind the song down. Six of the ten songs begin with a slower intro of clean \r\nelectric guitars and bass and most of those end the same way, sometimes seemingly unnecessarily so. 'Let's just play the slow intro for \r\nthe last few bars, gentleman, after the big thundering finish, you know, to make it all tie together'. The beginning of 'Out of the \r\nShadows' harkens back to 'Revelations' from 'Piece of Mind'. And some of the drum rhythms are the same, in particular the \"ONE...\r\ntwo... three... ONE... two... three\" approach that's in 'The Pilgrim' and 'For the Greater Good of God', which is also in songs on their other \r\nrecent albums.<p><p>In a way, Iron Maiden have what I call AC/DC syndrome, which is where the band basically follows the same approach album after \r\nalbum, musically and lyrically, and every album has its great songs that typify the band's ability and style but also have some songs \r\nthat just seem to rely so heavily on that formula that they sound redundant.<p><p>Okay, that sounds like some harsh criticism and a reason to not buy this album. But as I mentioned earlier, once I started listening to \r\nthis album all the way through, there were great moments in every song with some being greater than others. I was feeling really good \r\nabout the songs and believing the album to be actually worthy of four stars after all.<p><p>Yes, I guess it is too late in Iron Maiden's career for them to pull an Opeth and go off in a very different direction and I think no one \r\nwould want them to. Their fans know what they're going to get on an Iron Maiden LP and that's what the band is expected to deliver. \r\nAnd they do. Very well. And this album is no exception.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1524632#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1524632\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1524632\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, February 3, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12942#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1524632)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs Maiden's modern 2000 and on Dickinson/Smith reunion era material goes, I'd say A Matter of Life and Death deserves its place soundly in the middle - better than The Final Frontier and Dance of Death, but not as solid and consistent as Brave New World.
