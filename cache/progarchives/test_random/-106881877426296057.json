Otherwise, the album only consist of 90's hard-rock \r\nmaterial.<p>Speaking non-prog now, this is a very good hard rock album and I personally like several of \r\nthe songs, and Im sure that fans of the band will enjoy this release too.

As I've said before, my introduction to \r\nwhat in my mind I conceive as \"good rock\" was The Doors; but my introduction to the \r\ngenre that probably has taken most of my listening-time these last years, metal (and \r\nprogressive-metal) came in the shape of two particular albums: Sepultura's CHAOS AD, \r\nand Iron Maiden's FEAR OF THE DARK. As it's pretty much obvious that I can't review \r\nthe former in this website, I've decided to talk about my feelings towards one of the \r\nweakest, yet most-beloved (by me) albums in the catalogue of the group that, in my \r\neyes, truly finished making the goal of having <em>good</em> metal an achievable one. <p> I remember how I got this CD, many, many years ago. I kind of borrowed from a friend \r\nwho liked all kinds of music just because the \"Iron Maiden\" name had always generated \r\ninterest in my mind. The covers with the ugly skeleton-like creature (later I knew what \r\nits name was) made me think that the music inside would be truly \"devil's music\". You \r\nknow, after being raised with classical music and The Doors being the utmost \r\ndeclaration of \"rebellion\" in my then-poor musical-world knowledge, a CD with such a \r\ncover, such a name, and coming from such a \"evil\" band (as they were hailed) was \r\nreally something quite extreme. So I borrowed the CD alongside Sepultura's album \r\nwhich, at least in the cover department, was far less \"demonic\". Little did I know that \r\nthe music inside was much more violent. <p> I didn't immediately love Iron Maiden but I DID immediately fall in love with a particular \r\nsong, the title track. In a rather absurd way of acting, I was kind of \"ashamed\" (please, \r\nI was VERY young) to like a track by Iron Maiden, and kind of put it aside. But time \r\nbrought me back to the Irons. After all the metal that I put into my brain soon after my \r\nfirst experience, \"Fear of The Dark\" was no longer a menace nor something you had to \r\nhide. It was just music, metal music. And, I gradually realized, <strong>fantastic metal \r\nmusic</strong> at that. I already had experimented with lots of noise and machine-like \r\nbands like Pantera, Slayer, so Maiden's music wasn't extreme anymore, but now I could \r\nappreciate it with more musical background in my head and almost zero pre-conceptions \r\nand judgments in my mind and heart (those truly reached the ZERO years later, past \r\nadolescence, as with all of us). Years later, when progressive-metal and progressive-\r\nrock in general had crushed all of my earlier favorite bands and sent them to oblivion, \r\nonly a couple of the original remained, and only one metal band stood beside The Doors \r\nas the only one I dare to put in the same level as the Dream Theaters, Flower Kings, \r\netc: Iron Maiden. (with time finally those \"levels\" have disappeared allowing me to \r\nenjoy music more for what it is rather than for what some weird idea makes us want it \r\nto be). <p>About the album (yes, let's talk a little about it), it's not really Iron Maiden's best. In \r\nsome ways is one of the worst, as it has a sound that at times reminds us of Guns N' \r\nRoses (?!), Def Leppard (?!) and other bands that, while good, are not usually what we \r\nassociate with Maiden, and which write much better music in <em>their own</em> styles \r\nthan what Maiden manages to do when sounding like them. But the few pure Maiden \r\nsongs that we can find in FEAR OF THE DARK are some of the best in the catalogue, an \r\nstrange happening this record where we can find true gems alongside true bore-fests. <p>Be Quick or Be Dead (9/10) What energy this song has! It's no wonder why Nicko \r\nMcBrain is always smiling while playing: believe me, as I drummer I have tried, \r\n<strong>there's no way to play this song with a cold, uneventful face</strong>. Excellent, \r\nthough maybe not groundbreaking and not as fantastic as other Maiden fast songs \r\nas \"Aces High\". <p> From Here To Eternity (6/10) Here the problems start. This song is weak, sounds like \r\nanother band's, even Dickinson trying to sound different (in a bad way). A very weak \r\nsong. At times it sounds like AC/DC.<p> Afraid To Shoot Strangers (10/10) The lack of congruence in this albums is evident \r\nhere, as suddenly we encounter one of the best songs in the bands' catalogue. Divided \r\nin three sections, the first one melodic, the second epic, the third energetic and with a \r\nfantastic guitar lead, it stands as one of my favorites from The Irons. <p> Fear is The Key (6.5/10) This one sounds like a weak rocker by another band, not \r\nincredibly bad but so uninspired. <p> Childhood's End (7.5/10) The beginning sounds like Iron Maiden, that's a true Maiden \r\nguitar, the always-great Harris' bass. The song itself is not up to the level of the band's \r\nbest tracks but it's enjoyable. <p> Wasting Love (6.5/10) The start of this track reminds us of Def Leppard's early \r\nrecordings (Bringin' On the Heartbreak). Could be logical as both bands belonged to the \r\nstart of what was called the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\" (Def Leppard really \r\nleaving that path very soon), but this is 1992 we're talking about, Iron Maiden shouldn't \r\nsound like another band sounded 10 years ago. Not awful, but not too Maiden. For \r\nsuch a slow song, it should have more melody, as Maiden is capable of delivering. <p> The Fugitive (6.5/10) This sounds like Iron Maiden but not at their best. It has some \r\nenergy but lacks inspiration. The chorus gets old very soon.  <p> Chains of Misery (6/10) Another strange mix of Iron Maiden and a few other bands. \r\nThe songs lacks a hook and the chorus could get annoying if heard too many times. <p> The Apparition (5/10) The worst song in the album, even Dickinson sounds weird here. \r\nThe music starts very similar to \"Fear is the Key\" but then lacks a chorus or any good \r\ncatch. Bad, bad song. <p> Judas be my Guide (8/10) At last we got some Iron Maiden back. The song is not truly \r\nmagnificent as it's pretty generic, but it has energy, melody, a great, catchy, \r\nmemorable chorus, and the guitars sound like Maiden's, not somebody else's. It's a little \r\ntoo short and unoriginal but just for the entertainment factor it could get even a higher \r\ngrade. <p> Weekend Warrior (5/10) The Guns N' Roses moment in FEAR OF THE DARK, it sounds \r\nlike a track straight from USE YOUR ILLUSION I, and not one of the most inspired \r\nprecisely. Dickinson even sounds like a poor-man's Axl Rose at times (I think Dickinson \r\ncould run circles around Rose at singing <strong>when  sounding like himself, not like \r\nRose</strong>). Another melody-less song, the other bad valley we have to walk upon \r\nbefore climbing at last. <p> Fear of the Dark (10/10) After such a weak album, the finish is nothing short of \r\nextraordinaire. From the first, haunting, menacing notes to the explosion of energy in \r\nthe main part, from McBrain's thundering drumming to Murray's and Gers' magnificent \r\nguitars, from Harris' perfect bass to Dickinson's unrivaled powerful vocals, this tracks \r\nhas everything a Maiden track could have, even a section that in live concerts can \r\nreally be chanted along. A true anthem in all the Maiden Catalogue, it remains as \r\nprobably one of my three favorite Iron Maiden songs ever, and I know it's not only \r\nbecause of my sentimental attachment to it, but also because it's really that good. <p> All in all, as uneven an album as it gets, for alongside utterly boring songs we have a \r\ncouple of the best tracks the British machine ever gave us. I can't rate it lower than 3 \r\nstars, I just can't when \"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\" and \"Fear of the Dark\" are here. \r\nBut I can't go higher, either. And without those two songs, this album probably could've \r\nreceived a truly disastrous rating. From a progressive standpoint, not the most \r\nprogressive Maiden ever released, but at least it has two songs that make up for that \r\nweakness. <p>Recommended for: Iron Maiden fans, good metal and progressive-metal fans, good \r\nmusic fans, if only for a few moments throughout the record. <p>Not recommended for: People that can't stand heavy-metal or that can't stand their \r\nIron Maiden sounding like a lot of bands at the same time, none of those actually being \r\ncalled Iron Maiden.<p> .But get it anyway. The two song I've mentioned till exhaustion WILL make you \r\novercome your fear of the dark.   \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=125464#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=125464\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=125464\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, June 11, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #125464)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWELL, I'M JUST A MODERN GUY...<p>The last Dickinson album (first period) as lead vocalist is not the best Maiden one.<p>Some pure heavy metal formatted song (\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\",  ) heavier ones (\"From Here To Eternity\") and even some good \r\nones.<p>At times, some better shaped songs like in the good old days will make their appearance. \"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\" is one of \r\nthese, for sure. Wild beat, superb guitar. Almost seven minutes of happiness. But such song is scarce on this album. A highlight.<p>I prefer to listen to a band that is faithful to its roots (Maiden could have turned AOR maybe.) than to one which is changing its \r\nstyle like a hundred ones maybe; The Oriental mood of a song like \"Fear Is the Key\" seriously reminds me \"Purple\" (Mark II B) and \r\nat the end of the day, it is not as bad as that.<p>A funny fact that arose my attention already in their previous album, is the use of titles. <p>\"The Assassin\", \"Hooks In You\" featured on \"No Prayer For The Dying\" while \"Childhood's End\" is another one from this album. \r\nSuperb guitar, powerful and catchy guitar and a great beat. One of the best song here and a highlight as far as I am concerned.<p>Needless to say from whom these titles are coming from.<p>It is difficult to write that this album is really bad. So far, Maiden has always taken care that their work could be considered at \r\nworse as average. IMHHO, it will still be the case with this album. Not a lot of grandiose numbers of course, but this work needs \r\nto be regarded for what it is : one out of many albums of a leading heavy-metal band in the music history. Full stop. <p>Loads of \"progressive\" metal bands are just a pale copy of this excellent band. Even if not great, this album could still show the \r\nway to go to most of the so called \"great\" prog-metal offerings.<p>The very first seconds of \"Chains Of Misery\" automatically reminds me of \"The Passenger\" from Iggy Pop of course. Unfortunately, the fantastic beat of the original won't last for long but I can't say that it is \r\na complete waste. Just average. What I know for sure is that I'll just play this incredible song (\"The Passenger\" of course) just \r\nafter this album.<p>If ever you would like to listen to one of the most metallic, most heavy metal Maiden offering : do grab this one. If ever you \r\nwould like to listen to five seconds of prog music : don't grab this one (nor any Maiden ones actually). A song as \"The Apparition\" \r\ndoesn't belong to this site of course. AT ALL.<p>\"Judas Be Me Guide\" is another great and energetic song. Just to confirm that the band has not forgotten to write catchy metal \r\nanthems.<p>This album will still peak at the first spot of the UK charts.Not in mine. As ANY Maiden album, there is no prog to be expected. \r\nBut I had nothing to do with their inclusion on PA. Very little reviews with comments for this album. But this is a global tendency \r\nunfortunately : after the first and famous albums of a band, reviewing of later work really seems of no importance.<p>It is the reason why I tend to review as many albums as I can form a band. To analyse their evolution and to be able to depict \r\nsome ups and downs in their career. This means of course that it is not always a great experience. Still, this album is OK.<p>Three stars. Just listen to the excellent title and closing track to be convinced. <p>I'm rushing now to \"The Passenger\" from the album \"Lust for Life\".<p> \"OF COURSE, I'VE HAD IT IN THE EAR BEFORE\".</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=154794#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=154794\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=154794\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, December 8, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #154794)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10195\"><strong>Queen By-Tor</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10195\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10195/reefer-madness1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>I guess they weren't quick enough.</B><p>While it's true that the '90s were going to be just as much of a change for the big bands of the\r\n'80s as was the change from '70s to '80s, but who knew that these cult giants were going to be\r\naffected so much? While <I>No Prayer For The Dying</I> showed a significant change in style with the\r\nband moving further and further away from the fantasy flavored music they'd become so good at\r\nplaying, this one only further proved that the band were confused with what they were doing. The\r\nlack of Adrian Smith also proved to be a nuisance, even with a talented gent like Jannick Gers at\r\nthe helm of one of the dual guitars, and with Bruce about to embark on his solo ventures it just\r\nsounds like the band is falling apart here.<p>What's unfortunate about this album is that it just feels, for the most part, like filler. Some of\r\nthe songs simply lack the energy and passion that Maiden usually shows. Very few tracks really jump\r\noff the page, and while the music seems to have gotten darker (something that works for a lot of\r\nband such as this) it doesn't seem to help very much. Still with some catchy hooks (the same kind\r\nthat saved <I>No Prayer.</I> from complete disaster) in songs like the blistering <B>From Here To\r\nEternity</B>, the dark and eerie <B>Judas My Guide</B> and the heavy classic <B>Be Quick Or Be\r\nDead</B> the rest of the album simply ceases to get some feet under it.<p>There's mixed feelings about the longer songs on the album. <B>Afraid To Shoot Strangers</B> is a\r\nmournful lament which really gains speed at the end. This one is definitely one of the standouts on\r\nthe album, with Bruce's emotional delivery and the screaming guitars put forth by the ax-men.\r\n<B>Fear Of The Dark</B> is the other long track on the album, but really - this one was always\r\nbetter live. While complex and enticing in structure with that ever fun story behind it, it's always\r\nseemed that the studio version of this song just lacks that energy that the live performances of the\r\nsong has. This is with the ability of hindsight of course, because without knowledge of impending\r\nblistering performances of this song, it would still be a great standout on the album.<p>Standouts aside, this one is full of filler. Still a good album for those who love the band, the\r\nrest of us should just leave it to them. If you're a huge fan of the title track after hearing live\r\nversions of it, then it's actually better to leave it that way unfortunately. This one is going to\r\nget a 2. Luckily (in a weird kind of way) the masterminds of this band would soon part to take on\r\nseparate ventures leaving them completely reinvigorated come time for the next classic line-up\r\nalbum. Unfortunately, that's not until the turn of the century.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=170359#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=170359\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=170359\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, May 9, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #170359)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/1stars.gif\" alt=\"1 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI'll be honest-- I love Iron Maiden; their axe-work energizes, Dickinson's vocals remedy any gloom, and \r\ntheir over the top style is brilliant.  This, and more, makes me want to shrivel up and cry when I listen \r\nto Fear of the Dark-- a fantastically bland failure on so many levels.  <p>To start, is the simple fact that this album is dominated by Bruce's lyrics-- which deserve credit for at least \r\nbeing <em>slightly</em> different thematically than his previous ones (no songs about WWII?!) but which \r\nreally come down to words for the sake of filling the page.  This, combined with his overbearing, and now \r\nbanal, vocals simply make this one a chore to get through.  But he's not the only culprit.  The \r\ninstrumentalists here distincly phone this one in at all levels.  Their instensity-- blah; their creativity-- \r\nehh?; their solos-- good enough; their song writing-- formulaic.<p>Bottom line, ignore this one like the plague and keep your worthy vision of Maiden intact!

Besides that, I've regained much interest in this album since I was able to find this great double vinyl, it sound's great. <p>Now, about this Fear of the Dark album. The many differences in reviews are quite puzzling here. Most of the reviewers seem to agree on the fact that Iron Maiden has a very mature sound, but the quality of the song-writing and the performance of the band is debated fiercely. <p>After Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which is perceived as a masterpiece of progressive metal, the band had turned to a different direction that would evoke both memories of their first albums as well as allegations about going commercial (mainly due to songs like 'Holey Smoke', 'Can I play with Madness' and the currently reviewed 'From Here to Eternity'). It is definitely truth that Iron Maiden got a more main-stream sound on the Fear of the Dark album, but by doing that they also embraced a specific art-rock sound that would mix very well with Maiden's great sounding guitars. This album always felt 'different' from all Iron Maiden albums, though X-Factor would have a resembling sound (albeit still very different due to the change of vocalist). <p>Fear of the Dark has it's own mind-set, a new way of doing things. 'Be Quick or be Dead' would be the heaviest opening song of all Iron Maiden albums. It's very energetic and I love the almost frantic guitar-playing in the riffs. Of course the solo's are all great! 'From Here to Eternity' is a more commercial effort with simple melodies and a stadium-rock sound, but the lyrics are actually quite funny and the way you'll hear the motorcycles during the instrumental section is actually quite exciting. <p>'Afraid to shoot Strangers' is the first epical track that really showcases how different this album is. The long low-volume opening section with sensible and intelligent political lyrics (quite rare in rock-music) and a brilliant melodic, bombastic instrumental ending section. The guitarsolo's are again some of the best ever played on a metal-track. 'Fear is the Key' has a distinctive, slightly dark atmosphere that some can dislike. The bridge is however very strong and the song evolves very interesting. <p>Childhood's End is another unique Maiden song that has a great sound a perhaps some folk-influences (in the instrumental theme). A really strong emotional effort in my book. 'Wasting Love' is a hard-rock ballad with great guitar arpeggio's in the couplet-theme. I like some of the lyrics, like: \"Maybe someday.. I'll be an honest man\". <p>'The Fugitive' is one of Iron Maiden's stronger progressive metal songs. The troubled atmosphere of the song-writing and the fear in the vocals of Bruce Dickinson are great during the couplet themes and the refrains are very strong. The lyrics about an innocent fugitive who tries to clear his name are some of the strongest of the Maiden discography. Besides that, the instrumental themes are very original and the use of acoustic guitars during some parts is very intelligent. With \"Chains of Misery' the band tries to write commercially adaptable material, but fails. In this case, it isn't much of a problem; the song just has a to much of distinctive atmosphere to be suited for the masses. Still the stadium-like sound is present.<p>'The Apparition' is again a very original song. With a un-Maiden like atmosphere during the couplet theme on the beginning and ending of the song and a great instrumental theme in the middle it's just a bit unconventional. Again we get to listen to lyrics with a story and vocals of Bruce that show how much the song owes to his brilliant interpretation of the guitar-themes. The instrumental section is very strong and the solo's.. again.. those brilliant Iron Maiden guitar solo's. Can't get enough of that. \"Judas be my Guide' is a more conventional song, but Iron Maiden presents itself as a very melodic metal act. I love the main riffs and warm, almost tender atmosphere of this song.  <p>'Weekend Warrior' is a song that has much in common with before mentioned 'The Apparition'. Again lyrics with a political involved story (about the abuse of football hooligans) brought from the eyes of a single hooligan. \"And afterward's you feel so ashamed, and after all; it's only a game!', sings Dickinson. The melodic, sensitive instrumental section of this song is perhaps the most beautiful of the album. The title track 'Fear of the Dark' is again one the strongest songs of this album. The opening double-guitar melody can rightfully be named legendary and the atmosphere of the couplet theme is a thrill. The lyrics are brought very convincingly and the refrain and instrumental sections are all as memorable as can be. The \"Feaaaar of the Daaaark\" ending section with it's nice melodic guitar's is a real way to treat your fans live with a feeling of togetherness. Brilliant track back then and it still is brilliant today, only topped by some of it's even more convincing live versions. <p>Conclusion. This is an Iron Maiden record you can really spend some time on. One day you think you know all about it, another day it seems like there's still so much more to it. With it's twelve songs, of which I would call seven songs masterpieces and five songs 'just great' it's a long album. If I'm not mistaken the first studio effort by Maiden that would be printed on a double vinyl. On the Fear of the Dark album Iron Maiden renews itself and comes with a lot of delicate song-writing, a great sound, very strong vocals by Bruce, the best guitar-solo's and many memorable instrumental parts with those recognizable twin-guitars. Still it is not a typical Iron Maiden album and even fans might have some trouble with it's distinctive approach. I fell in love (three times already) with it's diversity, it's song-writing & composition and it's professional sound and perfect production. I think I'll call it a masterpiece of prog-related metal. Recommended to every-one who doesn't claim the be the one who knows how Iron Maiden SHOULD sound.  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=202327#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=202327\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=202327\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, February 10, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #202327)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>A more mature maiden!</strong><p>Fear Of The Dark was very much an anomaly in my CD player in the 90's, during which I \r\nmainly listened to alternative rock bands like Soundgarden and Pearl Jam. But unlike all \r\nthose alternative bands, or anything else I listened to in those days, this album has staying \r\npower. Fear Of The Dark was the first Iron Maiden album I ever heard and for a very long \r\ntime it was the <em>only</em> Iron Maiden album I had ever heard. It is fair to say that this was \r\n<em>the</em> Iron Maiden album for me during my early years as a music lover. <p>I certainly wouldn't call myself an Iron Maiden fan - not then, and not now - and also not \r\nreally a metal fan in general, but this album holds a very special place in my collection. \r\nIndeed, it cannot be excluded that this album actually influenced my personal musical \r\njourney towards progressive rock (even though in those days I did not know what \r\nprogressive rock was). However, I honestly do not think that my personal relationship with \r\nthis album affects my present rating in any way that makes it biased. It really is my (re-)\r\nconsidered judgement that this is one of the very best Iron Maiden albums! It is needless to \r\npoint out how vastly superior this album is compared with the previous, and very \r\ndisappointing No Prayer For The Dying. <p>Fear Of The Dark may not be as progressive as Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son or Brave \r\nNew World but it is highly melodic with very strong and memorable melodies and riffs and \r\nloads of great guitar solos. In my view there is not one weak song on this album and \r\nseveral of the songs are excellent. There is just one great melody after another and most of \r\nthe songs have a progressive touch. The progressive leanings can be found mostly in the \r\narrangements and in the details, but especially also in the many interesting tempo \r\nchanges and mood changes often within the same song. Like on Seventh Son Of A \r\nSeventh Son there are discrete keyboards in the background on several songs that adds a \r\ngreater depth to the music than on most earlier albums.<p>Afraid To Shoot Strangers is one of the more progressive songs here. I remember how \r\nimpressed I was by the several tempo and mood changes and great, highly melodic guitar \r\nparts and good solos. And today, I am still impressed with it! There is much progression in \r\nthis song too. Every time the main guitar melody returns, it is played slightly differently than \r\nthe last time around which proves that Iron Maiden can be intelligent when they want to. \r\nSubtle intelligence, in a way.<p>Wasting Love has a great guitar melody and is an unusual type of song for Iron Maiden to \r\ndo - it is something of a (semi-)ballad. This helps to make this album varied and \r\ninteresting throughout. It might be compared with Deep Purple's Wasted Sunsets from the \r\nPerfect Strangers album. Indeed, the voice of Bruce Dickinson sounds even closer to that of \r\nIan Gillan on this album than on other Iron Maiden albums, I think. On some parts of Fear Is \r\nThe Key you could easily believe that it <em>is</em> Ian Gillan singing!<p>The title track is a classic that, if I'm not mistaken, has become a live favourite for the band \r\nuntil this very day. It is a great song!<p>Many Iron Maiden fans seem to dislike this album, and that might be because it is a bit \r\ndifferent from many of their earlier albums - both lyrically and musically. Personally, I find \r\nthis album much more mature than most of their early albums. I find some of those early \r\nalbums somewhat naive and lacking in substance, especially some of the (supposed) \r\nepics that I often find repetitive and overlong. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son was to my \r\nmind the first great Iron Maiden album (and my all time favourite by them). Fear Of The Dark \r\nhas a nice diversity and also consistency.<p>I am always very restrictive with my higher ratings, but I do not hesitate to give this album \r\nfour stars. (And I do not do that to compensate for other people's low ratings, I never do \r\nthat!)<p>A very underrated album! Recommended even for people who are not Iron Maiden fans.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=218592#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=218592\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=218592\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, May 27, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #218592)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>FOTD</em> marks a good improvement over the <em>No Prayer</em> disaster.

It lacks epic qualities but on the other hand, the commercial tendencies\r\nthat got in the way of enjoying <em>7th Son</em> are at least done much more professionally now. The\r\nlesson learned being: if you're going to do AOR, at least do it competently. Especially the ballads\r\nare quite pleasant.<p>It's nothing that justifies rounding up the 2.5 stars though.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260768#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260768\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=260768\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 14, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #260768)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>Fear of the Dark</em> is the 9th full-length studio album by UK heavy metal act <B>Iron \r\nMaiden</B>. The album was released in May 1992 by <B>EMI Records</B>. The original \r\nalbum contains 12 tracks while the 1995 re-issue comes with a bonus CD with 7 additional \r\ntracks. <p>The music on the album continues the more hard rock influenced heavy metal style of the \r\npredecessor <em>No Prayer for the Dying (1990)</em>, but the sound is still unmistakably the \r\nsound of <B>Iron Maiden</B>. <B>Bruce Dickinson\u00b4s</B> distinct and strong vocal delivery is \r\nas always one of the defining elements in <B>Iron Maiden\u00b4s</B> sound, but the twin guitar \r\nleads that the band are known for are also present on <em>Fear of the Dark</em>. The \r\nmusicianship in general is excellent. Tracks like the fast-paced <em>Be Quick or Be Dead</em> \r\nand the two epic tracks <em>Afraid to Shoot Strangers</em> and the title track, are the tracks that \r\nmostly sound like the earlier output by the band while tracks like the more hard rock tinged \r\n<em>Weekend Warrior</em> and <em>Childhood's End</em> represent the other side of the album\u00b4s \r\nsound. Tracks like <em>The Fugitive</em>, <em>From Here to Eternity</em> and <em>Judas Be My \r\nGuide</em> fall somewhere in between.<p>The production is powerful and clean. The sound suits the music well.<p>While <em>Fear of the Dark</em> isn\u00b4t exactly a revelation and the album could have used a few \r\nmore metallic sounding songs, I actually find myself enjoying the album quite a bit. Either the \r\nyears have softened me or maybe the album isn\u00b4t as bad as I remembered it ( I used to dislike \r\nthe album, save for a few tracks). The bottom line is that even the hard rock tinged songs on \r\nthe album are enjoyable when I listen to the album today and I\u00b4ll go as far as to give the album \r\na 3.5 star rating.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=375389#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=375389\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=375389\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, January 7, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #375389)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=22970\"><strong>Conor Fynes</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=22970\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/22970/30451_10150198165215024_781110023_13173148_4731438_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> 'Fear Of The Dark' - Iron Maiden (7/10) </strong><p>Despite having one of the band's best-known crowd favourites, Iron Maiden's 'Fear Of The Dark' is a\r\nsomewhat less successful album for the legends, at least critically speaking. My first experience\r\nwith the band, the album may have more of a personal significance to me, and while proving to be one\r\nof the band's less consistent works, there is some great music here from the band. While not as good\r\nas the true classic material of the band, 'Fear Of The Dark' is an at-times wonderful collection of\r\ntracks from one of metal's most enduring acts.<p>'Be Quick Or Be Dead' kicks off the album in a fairly classic Maiden fashion; a fast pace, galloping\r\nrhythm, and Bruce Dickinson's howl makes this track one that I would not have been surprised to see\r\none of the earlier records. 'From Here To Eternity' also somewhat follows this formula. Truth be\r\ntold though, Iron Maiden does take the rest of the album down a somewhat different lane. While it's\r\ncertainly nothing alien to what Iron Maiden had already been doing, the music is perhaps a little\r\nmore conservative in terms of speed, with many of these tracks veering towards Judas Priest's\r\n'older' sound. Cutting straight to the point; this is done very well at times, but some songs fall\r\noff the wagon, and this may be why some fans of the band do not regard this album as highly. 'The\r\nFugitive' and 'Judas Be My Guide' are two more straightforward tracks that really rock. While the\r\nintensity is toned down a bit, the riffs are in much the same style that Maiden had done before.\r\nDespite the subdued angle, there is still the care taken to the dual guitar harmonies. Weekend\r\nWarrior' is the only miss of a track here, with fairly uninspired guitars and facepalm-inducing\r\nlyrics. Here, Iron Maiden virtually declaws their music, and despite being released in '92, 'Weekend\r\nWarrior' sounds like it would have been some arena rock track from the heyday of the '80s. One bad\r\napple aside, I don't think it hurts the rest of the songs.<p>Bruce Dickinson's voice is a point of contention for some, especially seeing as he would leave the\r\nband for the next two albums after this. Although some of the melodies are not so inspired or\r\nmemorable, his voice was still in top shape, although he does not quite sound like himself here. At\r\ntimes, he sounds like Rob Halford- a good thing- and at others, he ad-libs away in the style of Axl\r\nRose- a decidedly bad thing. 'Fear Of The Dark' certainly has some weaknesses to contend with, but\r\nthe album's two most involving songs take it from being merely decent, to a very good album. Those\r\ntwo are the famed title track, and the lesser-known 'Afraid To Shoot Strangers'. The first of these\r\nevokes a maddening response from the crowd whenever its played live, and for good reason. It begins\r\nwith a classic riff, then takes a breath as it gently builds into the most intense passage of the\r\nalbum. 'Afraid To Shoot Strangers' proceeds in much the same manner, with perhaps a more progressive\r\ndirection. With these two songs alone, 'Fear Of The Dark' is more than worth a listen to a fan of\r\nthe band.<p>Iron Maiden have gone through many phases, and 'Fear Of The Dark' falls on the brink of a rough\r\ntransition for the band. All the same, there are many good songs, and even some gold to hear with\r\nthis one. A painfully underrated album.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=572408#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=572408\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=572408\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, November 21, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #572408)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFor many die hard fans of Maiden this album is considered as weak compared to its \r\npredecessors for many reasons. As I am not one of those but I enjoy the Maiden music, I still \r\nconsider this as a good one to enjoy. Fear of the dark was Bruce's last record with Madien for \r\nquite a while and man is it a good one. Some consider this one sounds like a comeback to the \r\nclassic sound of Iron Maiden. A true Maiden album for even non-Maiden fans like me, and a \r\nmore than adequate followup to 1990's half-flop \"No Prayer for the Dying\", 1992's \"Fear of the \r\nDark\" delivers quite well musical composition. <p>I still engoy the double guitar work by Dave Murray and Janick Gers as well as powerful \r\nbassplaying by Steve Harris. From the opening track \"Be Quick or Be Dead\" to \"From Here To \r\nEternity\" I can feel the taste of Maiden's classic. Of course my favorite is the album title track \r\nwhich spans a longer duration with great bass guitar and double guitar harmony. As many of \r\nyou know that this track appears anywhere in their live concerts. In fact, the reason I purchased \r\nthe CD of this album was actually from one of their live CDs because I really enjoy the track \r\nperformed live and now I enjoy the studio version which is also excellent.<p>Overall, the album differs from previous Maiden records. It's like a mix between No Prayer for \r\nthe dying and Powerslave. My favorite is Seventh Son. Best cuts, I think : Be Quick or be dead, \r\nAfraid to shoot Strangers, Judas be my guide, Weekend Warrior and the best favourite track is \r\nFear of the dark.

When i first \r\nheard the 9th studio album FEAR OF THE DARK i reacted like many having experienced their \r\ndiscography more or less in chronological order by reacting positively to a few tracks such as \r\n\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\" which mimicked their classic anthem metal sound, but quickly \r\ndismissed most of this album and shelved it and moved on to other things. I just recently \r\npicked up the 90s IRON MAIDEN releases and gave them the modern day scrutiny. Wow. \r\nWas i surprised with this one. I guess i wasn't ready for this back in the 90s when i first heard \r\nthis and after many years of discovering the more progressive side of the rock world, i have \r\nonly now come to realize i had a gem in my midst for all this time from one of my favorite \r\nbands!<p>The stats: Bruce Dickinson would have enough and jump ship after this album but would \r\nreturn for 2000's \"Brave New World.\" First album to be produced by Steve Harris but last to \r\nfeature long time producer Martin Birch. Together they made a wonderfully sounding album. A \r\ntorch has been passed here. Also produced in Steve Harris' barn but the barn was converted \r\nto a full-fledged studio eliminating all the nasty gory details that plagued \"No Prayer For The \r\nDying.\" The album cover was the first NOT to be created by Derek Riggs. That spooky tree \r\nturned to creepy dude of the night was inspired and created by Melvyn Grant. Michael Kenney \r\nwas called in as a session musician for keyboards.<p>FEAR OF THE DARK actually has a suitable title for IRON MAIDEN fans. It was something \r\nthat included just enough of what came before but provided a whole bunch of different ideas \r\nthat actually made this album sound like a hodgepodge of ideas giving it a very disjointed type \r\nof feel. That is why i and many others just didn't warm up to this one as much as the previous \r\nofferings. This album was all about experimentation and at the time of first listening i was \r\nhaving none of it, but these days i'm finding this to be a much more sophisticated album than i \r\never could have realized despite not being perfect nor the best the band has to offer.<p>As with the previous album, the band eschews the fantasy and literary inspired lyrics and \r\nsticks to social and more reality based themes. The opener \"Be Quick Or Be Dead\" lures fans \r\nin with the classic galloping melodic metal that everyone would expect but things suddenly \r\ndrift in another direction with the second track \"From Here To Eternity\" which is actually the \r\nfourth song to continue the \"Charlotte The Harlot\" saga. This track has a new sound for the \r\nband. It is kinda like their old sound but has a rather speed ska feel to the verses. Once we \r\nget to the third track \"Afriad To Shoot Strangers\" we get a strange slowed down rocker that \r\nstarts out with that classic MAIDEN intro a la \"7th Son\" but morphs into one of those classic \r\nMAIDEN riffs with a nice atmospheric background that eventually becomes a recognizable \r\ngalloping metal frenzy.<p>\"Fear Is The Kay\" kinda reminds me of \"Holy Diver\" from Dio but MAIDENized of course. A \r\nslow tempo \"Childhood's End\" follows which actually continues the albums mood by having a \r\nmuch slower and alienating feel that most MAIDEN fans will not immediately warm up to. Still \r\nplenty of metal riffage accompanies. The rest follow suit with the exception of the out of place \r\n\"Weekend Warrior\" which honestly sounds like Bruce Dickinson sat in on the \"Back In Black\" \r\nsessions by AC/DC and incorporated a throwaway track. My least favorite. Finally the title \r\ntrack which became a fan favorite sing along in concert. Nice riffage, nice developments and a \r\nperfect mix of slow and fast elements. One of my original faves. \r\nAfter many years of having this on the shelf i'm surprised that i like this album so much now. It \r\nwas incubating somewhere in the cobwebs of my mind and now that i've unleashed its time-\r\ncapsule charm i am impressed. No, it will not usurp the throne of the most classic of MAIDEN \r\nalbums any time soon, but i highly recommend to anyone who wrote this off and shelved it to \r\ngive it a spin again to see if it may have aged well without their knowledge. It sure was the \r\ncase for yours truly.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1463371#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1463371\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1463371\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, September 14, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1463371)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11816\"><strong>Modrigue</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11816\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11816/PA-Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Maiden's most uneven release</strong><p>2.5 stars<p>In 1992, IRON MAIDEN's ninth studio album navigates in troubled waters. The recent explosion of\r\ngrunge highly overshadows traditional heavy metal bands. Furthermore, Harris and co.'s last opus,\r\n\"No Prayer For The Dying\", saws a clear lack of inspiration and renewal. \"Fear of the Dark\" roughly\r\nsuffers from the same problems than its predecessor, however with the difference that, this time,\r\ninteresting tracks are more numerous and especially more remarkable. Result: good and great titles,\r\nsometimes reminding the past glory, are surrounded by fillers ranking from average to bad. If the\r\nmusic neither possesses the ferocity of the first years nor pursues the progressive approach\r\ndeveloped at the end of the 80's, the epicness is (partially) back. Another noticeable point is that\r\n\"FOTD\" features the first songs co-written by guitarist Jannick Gers for the group.<p>Let's talk about the 5 interesting tracks first. From the beginning of the disc, you can hear an\r\nimprovement compared to the previous opus. Composed by Dickinson and Gers, \"Be Quick Or Be Dead\" is\r\na typical MAIDEN-ien raging, fast-paced opener, much more convincing than \"Tailgunner\". Steve\r\nHarris' \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" is one of the two little gems of the record. Setting up a\r\nmysterious and haunting atmosphere, the musics turns melancholic, until the gorgeously powerful\r\nbridge. A very catchy composition, on the level of the group's eighties' standards! \"Childhood's\r\nEnd\" is quite pleasant and epic, while \"The Fugitive\" is enjoyable. As you may have guessed, the\r\nother little gem is the well-known title track, the best of the album, a metal hymn worthy of\r\nMAIDEN's past grandeur.<p>The other songs are mostly flat or boring. Dickinson and Gers' \"Wasting Love\", the band's first\r\npower ballad, which dates back to Dickinson's first solo effort \"Tattooed Millionaire\", is rather\r\nso-so. Without \"Judas Be My Guide\" and \"Weekend Warrior\", \"FOTD\" would have been a correct release.<p>80's fans will have a strange impression after listening to \"Fear of the Dark\". An uneven album,\r\nwhere nice titles, and especially two of MAIDEN's best 90's compositions, are interlaced between\r\nmediocre ones. Nonetheless, these aren't numerous enough to make a convincing record. Why too much\r\nfillers? 2 or 3 of them could have been avoided. As a result, this ninth opus is better than its\r\npredecessor, but overall ranks as average. However, if you enjoy the group's 1982-1985 era, you'll\r\nstill have to give it a try, at least for the few songs cited above.<p>One year later, charismatic frontman Bruce Dickinson will left the band. Since ten years, his\r\nsinging greatly contributed to the epic ambiances and the success of the metal quintet. Then... what\r\nfuture for IRON MAIDEN?</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1674419#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1674419\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1674419\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, January 1, 2017</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12936#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1674419)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSome amazing  epic highlights ( Afraid to shoot Strangers and Fear of the Dark), some solid Iron Maiden  short songs (be quick \r\nor be dead, and at a lesser degree Judas my guide), some original but non maiden material like Wasting love or fear is the key \r\nwhicjh have their good moments, some class\r\n...
