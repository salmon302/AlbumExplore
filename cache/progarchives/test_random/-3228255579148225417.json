Sound-wise the band hasn't changed much since ' The Seventh House', but on this album the band \r\nhas finally revolutionized their composition style, arrangements and production. The symphonic layering by \r\nNeil Durant has this adult feel, reminding me of 'Tilt' era Scott Walker or 'Blackstar' era Bowie ' yet drenched \r\nin a Bladerunner like delicate sci-fi universe. Somehow this album sounds like a collaboration of the band IQ \r\nand... well a new 'force' that can look beyond its songs, its verses, its solo's and its refrains. Because of this \r\n'force' the band has also given new meaning to the prog epic. On 'Resistance' a prog epic isn't just a multi-\r\nsong. Don't take me wrong ' I really like a track like 'The Narrow Margin' ' but on this album the longer tracks \r\nreally make sense from a songwriting point of view. Bare with me. Like a in a small song, where a bridge can \r\nadd to strengthening the final refrain ' IQ manages to intelligently intervene and keep the song growing \r\ntowards that final refrain. Furthermore, the first cd, which is 'the album', flows like a continues experience. \r\nAlmost like a movie, including some modern cinematic sound-effects. What also becomes apparent after a \r\nfew spins is the absence of leaning on catchy refrains, which gives the music a modern feel ' at times almost \r\nhinting at modern classical music. <p>Peter Nicholl's voice doesn't allow for much variation, but because of the distinctive atmospheres of the songs \r\nhis performances do tick the box every time. This material doesn't need catchy line A or B, it needs a \r\nperformer. The rhythm section of the band has found a perfect balance between fusion styled sophistication \r\nand adding to the effectiveness of the material. Guitar player Mike Holmes somehow comes off as a bit left \r\nbehind in the old IQ with his Marillion/Floyd styled guitar solo's. On acoustic guitar his contributions strike me \r\nas more imminent ' like on 'Perfect Space'. If the band ever aims to top this album in the future ' which would \r\nprove extremely difficult I guess - the electric guitar will need to contribute in more diverse ways. <p>Now about that second disc, which I will describe in a bit more detail because most reviewers will probably \r\nfocus on the first disc. If that were an album; the 22 minute 'The Great Spirit Way' alone would suffice for an \r\nindispensable purchase. Personally, I think this song is placed right after the rather dark and soundtrack-like \r\nfirst disc because it matches best stylistically. 'Fire and Security' is a more traditional IQ piece ' albeit a bit \r\nbleak - with a balled type opening, some darker passages and a melancholy ending section with some strong \r\nlead guitars. On 'Perfect Space' the band drives its jazz/fusion influences to the max, which will perhaps turn \r\nof some ' but I like it. The second epic, the 20 minute 'Fallout' is a bit more relaxing, abstract and dreamy. In \r\nits second halve the band experiments beautifully with sophisticated chord progressions, which also allows \r\nfor Holmes' most interesting guitar solo. <p>Conclusion. Without a doubt this will become the progressive album of 2019 and I hope it will inspire a lot of \r\nother neo-progressive bands to elaborate and expand on their Marillion/Genesis/Floyd roots and take the \r\nmusic to a next level of artistry. This album will probably outshine the nostalgic likings of many of its listeners, \r\nbut it may also attract listeners that have previously written off the neo-prog genre. Can't wait to receive my \r\n3LP version of this grand album. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2264357#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2264357\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2264357\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, September 29, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2264357)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18139\"><strong>poslednijat_colobar</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18139\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18139/Ic&#111;na_prog_1.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> Staggering, poetical, profound, complete, powerful, inimitable... </strong> <p> The second best decade in the history of \r\nprog continues to astound by the verge of its end. Maybe this time even more than before... When you hear \r\nbeautifully wonderful lyrics entwined with the powerful keyboard lines and precise guitar solos most probably you are \r\nlistening to IQ. Their newest album <em> Resistance </em> is genuine and profound story for the music and history of the \r\nmusic more than ever. It is amazing how the calmness of this undisputible masterpiece has been implicated into every \r\nlittle sequence of the notes, and even into the intervals between the bass tunes. It is charming how this highest level of \r\nproduction, musicianship and songwriting abilities of the band members do not need any aspects of the music / \r\nmeans of expression to be extreme - neither the hardness, nor the intensity, or the complexity. They just accomplish \r\nthis staggering album with a balance. These musical heros just play with time signatures, intervals between tunes and \r\noctaves like the child with a toy. This is what could be called a natural balance of the abilities. <em> Resistance </em> \r\ncontains more music, more senses, more poetry than one can even imagine prior to the listening. It is rich, it is \r\nflourishing, it is a manifesto of making a sublime music and art. <p> <em> Most probably the best prog album of 21st \r\ncentury so far! </em> <p> <em> The most abundant prog album of all time! </em></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2267336#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2267336\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2267336\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, October 9, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2267336)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt's IQ! They're back with yet another attempt to celebrate and emulate the sounds, styles, and spirit of late 1970s GENESIS and YES. What they've achieved here is, in my opinion, a full step better than the dull, unmemorable monotony of 2014's Road of Bones. Resistance contains (mostly) excellent sound and production, as well as lush, melodic themes, inviting song constructs, and awesome solos. There are, however, Peter Nicholls' usual weird, nondescript, undecipherable-though-perfectly-enunciated lyrics sung in his usual steady, almost lazy, pleasant voice. As opposed to Road of Bones, there are high points (CD One's \"Rise\" through \"Shallow Bay\") and far fewer lows.<p>CD 1 (52:58)<p>1. \"A Missile\" (6:40) opens with some heavy riffing from the guitar, bass, organ, and drums while Peter Nicholls enters with his more insistent voice while always maintaining careful and clear diction. The song is hard-driving but does nothing for me either sonically, emotionally, or lyrically. It feels routine, robotic, one-dimensional, and, ultimately, forgettable. (11/15)<p>2. \"Rise\" (6:49) opens with apocalyptic wind noises and orchestral hits before a backwards sound loop takes over. Slowly, Peter's gentle voice sings over the atmospheric loop. At the end of his first chorus a very bass-heavy whole-band motif starts and drives powerfully forward. A strange chamber strings interlude breaks in for half a minute before we bounce back to the frenetic sonic lashing that is the second motif. Some nice, simple, but noticeable synth work is mixed into the thrum as well as some lead guitar work behind Peter's singing. In the sixth minute all kinds of Middle Eastern sounds and computer-effected vocals are introduced, but then they back off for a return to Peter's singing being the central focus. The final minute is simple, with Peter's vocal tying things up over that atmospheric loop from the beginning. Decent song! (13.5/15)<p>3. \"Stay Down\" (7:55) a long, slow, bare bones introductory period of electric piano arpeggi and synth washes and, later, chamber strings and 12-string guitar picking, allows Peter Nicholls to shine at his sensitive best. Mellotron voices and bass pedals add a great GENESIS feel. In fact it's four minutes into this one before anything changes--but then it gets tense, ominous, before breaking into a PORCUPINE TREE-like heaviness for its instrumental peak just before the five minute mark. When spaciousness is restored for Peter to sing around the six minute mark, it's merely a teasing pause before re-launching into that heavy PT territory for a final burst before some tick tocks. Powerful, seasoned prog with no fill and full power throughout. A top three song for me. (14/15)<p>4. \"Alampandria\" (3:48) opens beautifully with middle eastern pipe over sustained synth white noise synth. I love this! Then there is a developmental shift at 1:45 into more GENESIS-like Neo Prog territory. (Think deep throbbing parts of \"Supper's Ready\" or The Lamb). Small Mike Nicholls dramatic vocal, seering guitar solo, and organ finish this off. (8.9/10)<p>5. \"Shallow Bay\" (6:21) sensitive solo piano opens this one until the full band kicks in around 0:40. It quickly establishes itself as a melodic, syrupy song in the vein of radio-friendly prog hits. Drumming is outstanding--even a little flashy--throughout, and then the mood shifts quite dramatically at 3:00 into a more COLLAGE \"Moonshine\"-like vein. Very pretty--especially the keys--while the drumming remains quite showy and impressive. Beautiful song. Excellent emotional guitar solo in the fourth and fifth minutes with great band and Mellotron support. <p>This is where the advantages of a seasoned band shine through. Definitely a song I'll be listening to over and over for a long time. Perfection. A reminder of why I keep listening to new releases. My favorite song on the album. (10/10)<p>6. \"If Anything\" (6:03) cool drum machine opening before synth wash joins in giving it a MIKE AND THE MECHANICS or \"Captain of My Heart\" feel to it. Fretless bass enters just before Peter Nicholls enters singing in a whispy upper register voice--which is unusual for him. Real drums join in at the end of the second minute. I have to admit that I really like the work of the synths, fretless, and voice. Acoustic nylon string guitar seals the \"Captain of My Heart\" reference. A very nice, gentle, pretty song for late night wine and fireplace sitting--at least until the second half of the fifth minute when things get E.A. Poe dark--sound effects, scary church organ and all! The only thing it lacks is a true 'hook\" to make it memorable. (8.75/10)<p>7. \"For Another Lifetime\" (15:22) opens with weird circus calliope/squeeze-box-like chord sequence. Peter begins singing and it doesn't quite fit; Peter's nondescript melody line does not blend well with the synthesized calliope/squeeze box--nothing does, even the \"Entangled\"-like eerie synth added over the top. Just before the three minute mark Peter's voice is mute-distorted to try to create an even eerier feel and then the band breaks into a full on \"As Sure as Eggs is Eggs/Apocalypse in 9/8 imitation, trying to make it their own by adding some music box tinkles and some Duke-era bass synth chords. Halfway through the sixth minute the pace quickens and a more HACKETT-like section ensues. At 7:00 the music begins to feel more like ASIA or LOVERBOY. The \"resistance\" chorus just lacks ... hooks. Another switch into full on GENESIS territory at 8:20 while Peter continues singing as carefully, succinctly as ever. Power chords and more eerie organ and synths in the ninth. The music keeps bouncing around, trying to vary its pace and palette, no doubt, until finally finding its \"pocket\" in the twelfth minute with the \"for another lifetime\" chorus and ensuing excellent lead guitar solo. The voice Mellotron sound definitely makes it feel like some crescendo moment in a GENESIS song. Then we devolve to a bare piano in support of Peter's end vocal passage from 13:30 to the \"holding on\" line and the gorgeous TFK-like end. Pretty awesome song if derivative and perhaps overly complex. The band definitely put some work into this one. A strange dichotomy is that eerie circus-like motif used for the first half and then disappearing the more powerful the song became. (27/30)<p>CD 2 (55:39<p>1. \"The Great Spirit Way\" (21:45) Prog by the numbers trying to be Hammond-centric. In the first half, none of the individual instrumental threads works--especially the drums, bass, and guitars; they all seem to be at odds with one another. The second half gets spread out and less dense with some electric piano and \"acoustic\" guitar picking before a spacey synth diversion settles us (and Peter) down. Interesting \"xylophone\" over strings. But, unfortnuately, it's all so obviously MIDI-computer keyboard generated. In the sixteenth minute they try to GENESIS/WAKEMAN the music back up to engage us but it's all so familiar (thought the drumming finally gets good). After the crescendo in the 17th minute, the YES-like d\u00e9nouement is a big letdown. (38/45)<p>2. \"Fire and Security\" (5:26) the welcome sound of steel-string acoustic guitar strumming opens this one. Peter's vocal starts out rather typical but then gets very emotional. As a matter of fact, there are sections here that I display vocal affectations that I can't remember hearing in his voice very often. Very nice guitar soloing throughout the second half. (9/10)<p>3. \"Perfect Space\" (8:33) cymbol play, snare, bass, and classical guitar make this one sound a little jazzy or Latin-infused. Peter's voice is even mixed more forward than usual. Interesting! A new sound palette! The little electric guitar solo at 1:38 can't even destroy the feel of this one but the organ and bass pedals at 2:36 for the chorus does. The bass and drums are trying admirably to hold it together but those organs! Then the guitar turns metal and we've lost that loving Latin feeling. The return of \"Get 'em out by Friday\"! Let me out! Nice first half; poor second. Not even the walking bass play in the sixth minute or some solid electric guitar soloing in the final minute can recapture that awesomeness. (16.5/20)<p>4. \"Fallout\" (19:55) \"CTTE 2\"? What kind of lyrics are these? Nonsensical? The first three minutes sure seems so. At four minutes we finally get into some meat. I like the clavichord and rolling bass line. The singing harmonies are great but the lyrics are still so innocuous. GREAT transition into the instrumental section in the sixth minute (bass and electric guitar)--a powerful section that sustains its engaging sounds and play for several minutes. Nice drumming in the next instrumental section. And fretless bass! At the eight minute mark we go soft and spacey again (very GENESIS-like). Another sound (and key) switch in the eleventh minute: piano-base, more cymbal play, going into an instrumental section with piano solo, MIDI-ed tuned percussion, and chord section into a late-\"Gates of Delirium\" section for the fourteenth and fifteenth minutes. (A little too similar to \"Gates,\" even through the guitar solo and drum end, even into the pre-\"Soon\" quiet, spacey section). The final two minutes is, unfortunately, also an embarrassing imitation of the \"Soon\" finale of \"Gates of Delirium.\" Very nice sound. I'd rate it higher if it weren't so derivative. (34/40)<p>Total Time 108:37<p>Can we be tired of Peter Nicholls' melodies, pronunciation/elocution, and phrasing, please? Can we be tired of the Duke-like drum machines and differently engineered & effected tracks that are so blatantly and poorly spliced-together, please? Can we say we've had enough imitation and blatant derivation of the 1970's \"classics?\" Still this is SO MUCH BETTER than the high-acclaimed yet soulless \"album of the year\" from 2014, Road of Bones.<p>B=/four stars; if one stays away from the three epics, this is an excellent addition to any prog lover's music collection and one of the better displays of Neo Prog of the 2010s.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2277777#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2277777\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2277777\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, November 2, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2277777)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThrough a consistent string of albums that date back to 1993's \"Ever,\" IQ has established itself as\r\nsomewhat as the new godfather of the neo-prog world as well as one of the superstars of the\r\nprogressive rock world in general. Carefully crafting each album and polishing them like fine\r\ngemstones which on the average has taken about five years between albums, IQ returns in 2019 with\r\nthe band's 11th album RESISTANCE. Consisting of the same lineup as 2014's \"The Road Of Bones,\"\r\nRESISTANCE continues that album's direction with even bolder atmospheric statements, new touches of\r\nsymphonic orchestration and a knack for amalgamating intricate melodies with tight instrumental\r\ninterplay all accompanied by Peter Nicholls' distinct and instantly recognizable vocal style.<p>While \"The Road Of Bones\" was released in two formats: a single album release and also as a double\r\nalbum, RESISTANCE goes for the gusto and has appeared only as a double album that is essentially two\r\ndistinct albums with the second half exhibiting a different atmospheric mood that sets itself apart\r\nbut never strays too far from the consistent IQ sound that permeates each and every album. With a\r\ntotal running time of almost 109 minutes, RESISTANCE comes across as a sprawling epic that takes the\r\nneo-prog paradigm further into the 21st century. With \"The Road Of Bones,\" IQ upped the ante as far\r\nas instrumental deliveries go. The band saw the new keyboard talents of Neil Durant as well as\r\nformer members drummer Paul Cook and bassist Tim Essau rejoining the ranks.<p>RESISTANCE in many ways is the continuation of its predecessor only five years into the future where\r\nit feels like technological gains have taken the band into a new futurist paradigm shift. While the\r\nclassic IQ rhythms, melodies and neo-prog essentials are the backbone of RESISTANCE, the album\r\nexcels in many ways. Firstly, Neil Durant has expanded his keyboard duties to include a whole host\r\nof new techniques and sonic timbres that expand in myriad directions. It's almost as if the mere\r\nrole of keyboards as been expanded into the entire sprawling genre of progressive electronic, where\r\nTangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze surreality has created a complete secondary backdrop to the rock\r\naspects but only used tastefully. <p>Also taking the band into further fields of complexity is the excellent drumming skills of Paul Cook\r\nwhose percussive drive seemed to lead rather than follow on \"The Road Of Bones\" and continues that\r\ntrait on RESISTANCE however in many cases he backs off and takes on the traditional role as merely\r\nkeeping the beat while the atmospheric constructs and melodic development of the themes expands its\r\ntentacles into the sprawling behemoth tracks that tackle the usual suspected emotional tugs and\r\nmusical dramatic flair that IQ has mastered so well. While the heavy guitar parts were toned down\r\nbeginning with the last album, they still existed and used as contrast and that is still the case\r\nwith much of the album seeming almost devoid of guitar sounds and others such as the Floydian\r\n\"Shallow Bay\" providing the Steve Hackett wailing guitar licks and others like \"Rise\" showcasing the\r\nheavier bombast not so prevalent on this album.<p>With this much music there's always bound to be a throwaway track or two and RESISTANCE is not well\r\nresistant to including such filler. Tracks like \"If Anything\" seem a little too tame and derivative\r\nof past glories and pale in company of the stronger tracks but at the same time they are not\r\ncompletely gag reflex inducing, just a bit tame and verge on the border with AOR sensibilities. \"For\r\nA Lifetime\" on the other hand is one of the strongest tracks with carnival music providing the main\r\nmelodic theme which allows an interesting array of creepy atmospheric gloom and a slinking theremin\r\nsound that ratchets up the dread. Perhaps the most unique IQ track ever as it breaks into slow-tempo\r\nrock and meanders over the 15 minute mark.<p>The second disc features the two longest tracks of all. \"The Great Spirit Way\" just missing the 22\r\nminute mark is one of the strongest of the lot. In many ways the build up reminds me of some aspects\r\nof 90s Dream Theater in how the guitar stomps slowly build but the atmospheres and keyboards are\r\nclearly in IQ's neo-prog turf. Durant creates some of the most memorable ambient backdrops on this\r\none. He also creates dramatic keyboard stabs that remind me of classic 70s rock bands like The Who.\r\nOverall the track meanders through a vast territory of past and present ideas. It includes cool\r\npassages that exhibit wind chimes and orchestrations. It flows perfectly and shows IQ at its most\r\ninnovative. <p>The second lengthiest track is the near 20 minute closer \"Fallout,\" which features a heavenly\r\nambient intro that incrementally ratchets up the tension and extends the ideas of a single track\r\ninto a monstrous behemoth of a track. Notable for not merely being a bunch of ideas stitched\r\ntogether but feeling like a consistently morphing track that sticks to a theme. So all in all,\r\nRESISTANCE is another excellent development in the IQ universe with two stellar discs worth of\r\nimpeccably produced material that finds the aspects of the album in perfect cohesion. The greatest\r\ndevelopment is clearly the highly developed ambience and atmospheric constructs however the band has\r\ncontinued to become bolder as time goes. <p>Once again, i find the latest IQ release to be an excellent album but as with most of the band's\r\nefforts, it seems to fall short from perfection. My main gripe with these grandiose instrumental\r\ndevelopments is that Peter Nicholls still exhibits the exact same style without expanding the vocal\r\npossibilities. Add to that a few filler tracks and the album tends to become a bit of a chore to sit\r\nthrough at least in one sitting. While there is plenty to love for neo-prog fans here, i just wish a\r\nfew of the shorter tracks were edited out and that Nicholls would find a way to sound less\r\nmonotonous as every album starts to sound like the same vocal motifs despite the musical\r\naccompaniment. Perhaps a second vocalist adding counterpoints would solve this. Still though, a well\r\ndone album and an instant prog classic.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2278896#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2278896\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2278896\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, November 7, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2278896)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nYou'd have thought that sooner or later IQ would have released a bad or mediocre album to break the run of top-\r\nnotch studio releases they've been on since 1993's Ever, but that day has not come yet; Resistance is another double-\r\nalbum of high-quality neo-prog from a band who've been the undisputed kings of the style for the last quarter of a \r\ncentury.<p>In latter years IQ have been cautious about the pace of their studio releases, affording themselves ample time to \r\npolish their material before unleashing it on our ears. This time around, they reward patient fans with an abundance \r\nof material, with the album running to two CDs as standard. (The Road of Bones also had two discs in its special \r\nedition.)<p>As others have noted, the new twist IQ offer this time around largely comes in the form of the keyboard work of Neil \r\nDurant, who'd spent Road of Bones acclimatising himself to his new role. Here he expresses more of his own \r\ndistinctive sound, rather than mimic IQ keyboardists past, and with it adds a certain wistful, cinematic flair to \r\nproceedings. With songs ranging from heavy, crushing hard prog to almost pop-like ballads to more standard IQ fare, \r\nthis is an album which is easily as diverse as the similarly melodramatic Subterranea, and I look forward to unfolding \r\nits secrets for many years to come just as I have with that piece.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2284523#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2284523\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2284523\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, November 28, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2284523)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5\"><strong>maani</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Founding Moderator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5/klaatu_hopef.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ and Marillion arguably \"started\" neo-prog (with their near-simultaneous 1983 releases, Script for a Jester's Tear and \r\nTales from the Lush Attic, respectively).

And although I don't agree with many of my colleagues here that Resistance is BETTER \r\nthan Road of Bones, it is certainly equal (or almost so) in its relentless brilliance of lyrics, musicianship, and sound.  \r\nFew bands can provide the stunning beauty of If Anything, the progressive fireworks of A Missile and Stay Down, the \r\nextended progressive magnificence of for Another Lifetime and The Great Spirit Way, and the sonic intensity of \r\nAlampandria all on one album?  Peter Nicholls continues to write some of the most wonderful, if often esoteric, lyrics, \r\nand he has been and continues to be  my favorite current vocalist in prog.  And the band, with keyboardist Neil Durant \r\nnow comfortably ensconced, continues to write and play some of the most compelling music in the genre.  As others \r\nhave pointed out, IQ is most heavily influenced by Genesis (as were so many early neo-prog bands), but as I have \r\nnoted ad nauseam on these pages, for me the success of a neo-prog band is in the way in which they channel those \r\ninfluences through their own individual filters.  IQ (and Marillion) does this better than anyone: I have always felt that \r\nthey essentially continue to re-write Genesis' long-form songs (everything from Watcher and Friday, to Can Utility and \r\nSupper's Ready, from Firth of Fifth and Cinema Show, to Lilywhite Lilith and One For the Vine), particularly with \r\nHolmes' sound (the reverb and echo-heavy sound that Hackett made his own) and playing (Hackett's style is quite \r\nevident).  This is not a criticism, it is the highest of compliments.  I don't think there is a band whose new albums I \r\nanticipate more than IQ.  They are simply a wonder.  The consistency of their writing and performance, and the \r\ntechnical virtuosity of their playing, as well as Nicholls' expressive vocals, make them among the best of the best of \r\nprog.  Bravo.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2286753#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2286753\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2286753\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, December 11, 2019</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2286753)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23657\"><strong>rdtprog</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Heavy, RPI, Symph, JR/F Canterbury Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23657/131270147_3536190126417926_2125830169311317071_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter the excellent \"Road To The Bones\", I was not sure if the band could surpass themselves with another double album. From the first song, we get hooked by the heavy driven music. The genuine melodic ease of the band is present throughout this long journey that contains some new melodies never heard before and some brilliant arrangements with attention to detail for the production and the clarity in the sound. The band uses the latest technology with some electronic effects and at the same time, they open up with an oriental passage in the song \"Alampadria\". The guitar is quite heavy on the first titles and the music can't get as intense for too long and after one hour, I felt the need to take a break. You can't enjoy as much this double album if you listen to one take, even more, when the second album begins with a big epic. After repeated listening, this one is now my favorite IQ album. It's rare to see a band make great albums after 36 years. IQ is the perfect model for all the New Neo-Porg bands out there not only because the band is at the top of their class, but they can also teach you how to come close to perfection!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2311217#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2311217\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2311217\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, January 31, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2311217)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5626\"><strong>kev rowland</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Reviewer / Special Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5626\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5626/computersmash.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSince 2004's 'Dark Matter', IQ may have slowed the release schedule in that this is only their third album since then, \r\nbut they show no sign at all of slowing down in terms of consistency and sheer power in their music. Neil Durant \r\njoined the band back in 2010, but this is only his second new IQ album, and it is now that he is allowing his musical \r\nwings to spread. There is a confidence here from a keyboard player who doesn't feel that his primarily role is just to \r\nreduce the average age of the band (Mike Varty of course filling exactly the same position in Credo), but instead knows \r\nhe can take control when he wishes to with soaring keyboards and multiple banks of sound at his command. This has \r\nalso allowed the rest of the band to relax and the result is one of the best releases from the IQ canon, and given they \r\nhave very rarely produced anything apart from essential, that is quite some statement.<p><p>\r\nStrangely enough, the person who seems to be relishing this most is Paul Cook, the man who has been behind the \r\ndrums for all except one of their albums, 2009's 'Frequency'. I have never heard his playing to be quite so dramatic, \r\nquite so in your face, and it is down to his rhythm partner Tim Esau to keep things pinned down to allow Cookie the \r\nfreedom to be more expressive. Esau has also settled back into the band, actually being the \"new boy\" having only \r\nbeen back in the fold since 2011 ? strange to think he has now been back in the band as long as he was in it first time \r\naround ? and keeps everything simple, yet complex at the same time. As for Michael Holmes, the only person who has \r\nappeared on every single IQ release, he is relishing the opportunity to produce some of the heaviest guitar I have ever \r\nheard from him, but yet again he has the confidence to not play at all for whole passages, letting Neil and Peter have \r\nthe show to themselves if that is the right thing to do.<p><p>\r\nAh, Peter Nicholls. I do love the two non-Peter albums, and indeed play them frequently still, but Peter is the real voice \r\nof IQ and his stage presence is unsurpassed. Here he provides us with multiple persona, whether it is being reflective \r\non \"Stay Down\" or being the rocker on 'A Missile\". When talking about the album, Michael said: \"It's taken a while for \r\nthis album to develop, but to my mind that's given it a nice 'organic' feel with some quite diverse atmospheres. The \r\ninitial idea for Resistance was to have a single CD with an accompanying 'extras' disc, but the closer it got to the \r\nrelease the more we felt that everything just gelled as a proper double album. That's also meant we were able to give \r\neach track just the right amount of breathing space, whether that's a three-and-a-half-minute thing or a more \r\nsubstantial twenty-two minute 'workout'.\"<p><p>\r\nMichael describes the album as organic in the way it came together, but for me this is all about confidence. The \r\nconfidence of a band who have been atop the progressive world for so many years, nearly 40 years since they came \r\ntogether, and 36 years between the debut and their latest (with four of the five musicians involved in both). Simply \r\nbrilliant in every way, essential, superb.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2347356#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2347356\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2347356\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, April 3, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2347356)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=21717\"><strong>lazland</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=21717\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/21717/C9F46CF2-046E-4575-B1C8-33DFCCEEC05A.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI bow to no one in my admiration of this fine band, and the prospect, following a long wait, of a new album was mouth watering, \r\nespecially given the fact that, to these ears, the predecessor album, Road of Bones, remains one of the best in my collection.<p>By God, though, I have struggled with this. Of course, those of us who have listened to prog for many years, and have the privilege \r\nof writing down our thoughts, will be familiar with many exceptional works which on the first few listens sound average or even \r\ndreadful, but, with growing familiarity turn out to be that belter of a classic five star work.<p>I know that this is going against the grain somewhat, but I do not think that \r\nResistance is one of those albums, and, sorry, I think this is the weakest IQ album since Peter Nicholls returned gloriously to the fold.<p>To the ears of Lazland, the fault lies with the first cd. Very little of it progresses seamlessly. It is almost tuneless in parts. I dislike \r\nopener A Missile intently, with the overly layered keyboard effects hammering the theme somewhat relentlessly. Rise reminds me in \r\nparts of tracks from Frequency, but, unlike that fine work when the band worked together, this sounds very much like some post-\r\nproduction vocals stuck on top of a hotch potch of sounds, and guilty of the abiding sin of this whole work, which is far too much \r\nproduction, by which I mean the lack of emotion and emotive music, which to me are the hallmarks of this band.<p>The quieter pieces on Road of Bones dripped with menace and emotion, whereas Stay Down is merely rambling. I like the opening \r\npipe on Alampandria, but could have done without the synth backdrops, again rather over-produced. The song then segues into a \r\nby-numbers IQ riff. <p>Shallow Bay is a somewhat typical late period IQ track, and is very good, and the first time on the album that the band make me sit \r\nup and take notice of proceedings, especially with the marvellous rhythm section of Esau and Cook work throughout, and a \r\ntrademark Cook guitar solo.<p>Much of If Anything could have been transposed onto a late period Genesis album.  Not that there is anything wrong with that. I like \r\nlate Genesis. But the quieter moments on Seventh House, Dark Matter, Frequency, and Road of Bones were welcome and emotive \r\nparts of a whole body of work. It must be me, but I simply don't get how this fits into whatever narrative is being told here, and, once \r\nagain, the sound effects towards the end strike me as simply being a noise. The church organ could have been marvellous, but feels \r\nway out of place.<p>None of this, however, comes anywhere near the awfulness of the closer on cd 1, For Another Lifetime. I hate this bloody track, and I \r\nreally have tried to feel otherwise. The circus theme is damned annoying. The sound effects which come with it are shocking, and (I \r\nnever thought I would say this about one of my beloved acts) it is soporific. Nicholls' vocals are soporific. The keyboards are, yes, \r\nsoporific. I like experimentation. It is a critical part of musical excellence, but this is damned depressing. Different for the sake of \r\nbeing different, and I struggle like hell to see how it fits within whatever album narrative is being expressed to us. The rest of it is \r\nformulaic, but mostly I simply switch off well before this.<p>I doubt that I will listen to cd1 ever again, unless I am in a self-harm mood.<p>Thankfully, cd2 has much to recommend and please. <p>There are two huge epic tracks, opener The Great Spirit Way, and closer Fallout. The commencement of the former has a lovely, and \r\nthoroughly welcome, feel of a band jamming its way to the theme, but with surety and purpose. Cook and Esau thunder along, and, \r\nfor the first time on the album, Durant's keyboards support, rather than dominate, the music. Nicholls, again for the first time on the \r\nalbum, sounds as if he not only means what he is singing, but he does it in time with the music. Some of Holmes' work is delicate \r\nand quite lovely. The whole track has some exceptional moods, signature changes, and soars wonderfully in places. There is a rather \r\nlovely piano and acoustic guitar passage in the middle section, and then thoughtful keys before the track reasserts itself in \r\ngrandiose fashion. So, yes, an IQ epic, and whilst I would not put it up against classics of yore, in all honesty, it is so welcome after \r\nwhat came before, you cannot help but love it.<p>Fire and Security is of a muchness with much of the first cd, and is, therefore, somewhat forgettable. Not bad, but not much of \r\nanything.<p>Perfect Space opens thoughtfully, and is interesting, especially the snare, bass, and guitar interplay before we are transported back \r\nto more familiar IQ fare in the shape of Holmes guitar and Durant whirling away. Not a classic by any means, but okay, and could \r\nhave been great had the opening themes been explored far more.<p>All, though, is almost forgiven when you listen to album closer, Fallout. This most certainly is a classic IQ epic track. A thoughtful and \r\nambient opening sequence moves into darker territory. Once again, Cook and Esau absolutely shine in pushing the music along, \r\nHolmes dominates when he soars, and (I really hate to say this, because I think he is an excellent musician) Durant pulls off a \r\nmarvellous Orford contribution - by this, I mean he complements the music with some delicate and thoughtful touches, rather than \r\na sampled mess. This is a monster of a track, and thoroughly enjoyable. It has been placed as a worthy addition to the Lazland IQ \r\nplaylist.<p>So, to a rating. Three stars for this. A generous two stars for cd1, and a probably equally generous four stars for cd2. I like to think \r\nthat IQ have at least one more classic in them. Unfortunately, Resistance is not it.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2374479#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2374479\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2374479\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 25, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2374479)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=14399\"><strong>Hercules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=14399\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/14399/Wrapped_up_parrot_Hercules.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is going to hurt me. A lot.\r\nI love IQ. They are indisputably one of my favourite bands and make up a large part of my listening schedule. I \r\nlove each and every album with Peter Nichols and even like the Menel ones. I wondered if they could produce \r\nanother masterwork without the genius that is Martin Orford, but they achieved it with The Road of Bones, an \r\nalbum so good that even the bonus CD is better than most albums by anyone else. So when the new album was \r\nannounced, my vinyl order was in immediately and, when it arrived, it was straight on to the TT.\r\nTwo hours later, I was sitting in bewilderment. This was clearly IQ, but the wonderful melodies, variation of \r\nmood and the flow from part to part that was so characteristic of their music was missing. There's none of the \r\nbeauty of Constellations or the drama and menace of the title track of The Road of Bones itself. The \r\nmusicianship is, as ever, exceptional, and both Paul Cook and Tim Esau spread their wings more than on TROB. \r\nNeil Durant's keyboards are well played if a bit dominant; he hasn't found the consistent magic that Martin \r\nOrford had of being both bombastic yet supportive of and complementary to his bandmates. Mike Holmes, who \r\nis one of the truly great guitarists but seemed slightly subdued on TROB,  stretches out with more of his \r\ncharacteristic solos than on TROB. Peter Nicholls has improved as a vocalist too since the early days and is now \r\na very fine singer. However, the lyrics on this album are a bit like someone took 10000 words on a bit of paper, \r\nthrew them in the air and sang them as they landed. A bit like Yes, in fact, and not like the coherent story telling \r\non some previous tracks.\r\nThe problem is none of these guys' playing: it's the material. I've listened to this album about 5 times and I really \r\ndon't think I will ever listen to it again. The composition of the music is uninspired. IQ have done marvellous \r\nepics like Harvest of Souls or The Narrow Margin, but the ones on here are just nothing special. The whole first \r\nCD (or its vinyl equivalent) is just desperately substandard for IQ.\r\nThings do pick up a bit on CD2. The Great Spirit Way has its moments and Fallout is excellent, but I just wish I \r\ndidn't have to wait almost 100 minutes for it.\r\nIn truth I had warning that the new album might be a let down: I saw them live at The Met in Bury in 2018 and \r\nthey played 2 songs from the new album they were working on, which were both instantly forgettable.\r\nI hope IQ will keep going and produce another master work. Sadly, this album is not it.\r\n2.5 stars, which I will round up to 3 because I'd have to commit seppuku if I gave them 2.\r\nGod, writing that review REALLY hurt.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2411463#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2411463\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2411463\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, June 8, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2411463)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe perfect album to listen to during lockdown. I adore \r\nFrequency album and Road of Bones are both \r\nmasterpieces of prog and I did not think they could be \r\nbettered. Resistance is yet another masterpiece, making \r\nIQ one of the most consistent prog bands of recent \r\ntimes. <p>Resistance is a very dark concept and yet very uplifting. \r\nIt begins with beautiful synth lines and builds into an \r\naggressive power riff with pounding bass and drums; IQ \r\nin full flight are a wonder to behold. A Missile starts the \r\nalbum with a blaze of prog time switches and segues \r\ninto one powerhouse track after another. Stay Down is a \r\nglorious track with emotional vocals from the amazing \r\nPeter Nicholls. Shallow Bay is absolutely incredible \r\nmusicianship and it ends with the mindblowing For \r\nAnother Lifetime that has a running time of 15:22 and \r\ntakes us on a soul searching journey with astonishing \r\nmusical excellence and some chilling vocals. <p>CD 2 opens with the magnum opus The Great Spirit Way \r\nwhich is just short of 23 minutes long. It is a masterful \r\nmulti movement suite with shades of light and dark and \r\nby the end I was moved to tears by its emotional power.  \r\nFire and Security and Perfect Space are excellent also, \r\nleading to the epic 20 minute finale Fallout. This last \r\ntrack is brilliant, and the sweeping keyboard passages \r\nare so moving and majestic, absolutely beautiful music.<p>Peter Nicholls, Michael Holmes, Neil Durant, Tim Esau \r\nand Paul Cook are outstanding and IQ are one of the \r\nbest bands out there. I look forward to what else they \r\nhave in store. Their music is about as good as it gets. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2755457#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2755457\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2755457\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, May 20, 2022</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2755457)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n4.5 stars. I just can't give that fifth star despite wanting to. I want to because I like how they have changed things up on \r\nthis album. It reminds me of when \"Dark Matter\" came out with that heavier sound, well this one just sounds different \r\nbecause of the new keyboardist Neil Durant who joined the band on the previous effort \"The Road Of Bones\". We get \r\nthe same lineup as the previous recording in fact. <p>There's more space on this album, more atmosphere. My first spin \r\nthrough that second disc had me consciously saying I've never heard so much organ on an IQ album. Peter Nicholls \r\nsounds better than ever if that is possible. If you don't like Peter's vocals you probably don't like this band because he \r\ndominates each album as he does here. <p>Great album cover, that gate fold opens up looking apocalyptic then \r\nopening the package we get cold and ice as everything is blue and white. Contrasts right? Both apocalyptic but \r\ndifferent. We get plenty of contrasts on here. Album of the year on here for 2019? A Neo Prog album? Says something \r\nright there because that was a first for this site. I like how balanced this record is although more heaviness would have \r\nbeen appreciated as they do seem to meander a lot in those spacey moments. Again I'm okay with this I'm just excited \r\nat how good this one is and how slightly different it is as well. <p>We get three massive tracks with the 15 1/2 minute \r\ncloser \"For Another Lifetime\" on disc one plus the 22 minute opener \"The Great Spirit Way\" on disc two along with the \r\n20 minute closer \"Fallout\". \"The Missile\" and \"Rise\" the first two songs off disc one start the recording off perfectly in \r\nmy opinion, that nice heavy crunch plus some emotion is what this band is all about.<p> Without question a top five \r\nalbum for me for 2019 and really the only other Neo band that comes close right now in the '20's is PENDRAGON.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2950622#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2950622\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2950622\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, September 10, 2023</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=62629#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2950622)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt might seem I'm a hater of IQ... &#128514; not true, I've enjoyed their albums (at least some of their songs).
