Albums \r\nlike \"Somewhere In Time\" (this album) and \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" are \r\ndefinitely progressive enough to be included here, as well as the rest of their \r\ndiscography, considering that their post-\"Fear of The Dark\" albums all featuring strong \r\nprogressive elements to them.<p>Released at the top of their career, \"Somewhere In Time\" was stepping even further \r\ninto progressive territory and saw Iron Maiden experimenting with guitar synths, \r\ngiving the music a dark and spacey atmosphere throughout the album. It also has a \r\nbright epic feeling to it due to the spacey mood of the music and the cover for this \r\nalbum should give you an idea of this fact. Some Maiden fans found this album \r\nirritating and \"cheesy\" because of that when it was released back in 1986, but I think it \r\nworks extremely well, especially on the album opener \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" \r\nwhich sets the mood for the album perfectly. This album is less heavy than 1984's \"Powerslave\", which is their heaviest, and best, but not any less good. This \r\nalbum could be considered as a concept album since the song titles match each other as \r\na story of sorts, but it really isn't, though I'm not exactly sure yet. I would say this is \r\ntheir most progressive album in their 80's period.<p>The songs are for the most extremely good, very good performance from the band \r\ntoo. The production fits the music well and the only weak thing about this album \r\nis \"Heaven Can Wait\" which is to me the worst track here, though still being good. \r\nBruce Dickinson's voice sounds great here and he masters the lyrics well. He might go a \r\nbit overboard sometimes, but you'll get used to it. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray's \r\nguitars are clear and not too heavy, though their usual heavy riffing also is present \r\nhere. Nicko McBrain's drumming is excellent too; His powerful drumming style is defined \r\nwell here without getting out of control. The album is greatly supported by an amazing \r\ncover art by Derek Riggs, who also drawed most of their other covers.<p>The best tracks here are \"Caught Somewhere In Time\", \"Stranger In a Strange Land\" \r\nand \"Alexander The Great\". This is to me Iron Maiden's 2nd best release, only towered \r\nby \"Powerslave\". I'll give it 4.6/5. Recommended to any prog-metal collection, at least!<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93006#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93006\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93006\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93006)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFor the first time, Iron Maiden use synthesizer guitars through a sound quite similar to their \r\nprevious Powerslave album; this gives a real modern & slightly futuristic sound to the \r\nwhole: it even may make you think there are modern keyboards played in the background; \r\nunlike on the Judas Priest's Turbo album, the synthesizer guitars here rather sound \r\natmospheric. Looking at the complete art cover, one may inevitably think about the Blade \r\nRunner movie. The rhythmic electric guitar riffs are very sustained: their sound is however \r\nless razor & incisive, a bit more fuzzy and unclean than on Powerslave. Dickinson's voice \r\nhas a slight permanent echo: he still adopts a repetitive, complaining & angry tone. One \r\ncan notice Harris' omnipresent typical spring-like noise produced on his bass strings. The \r\nexcellent drums are restless and they sound like on the Powerslave album. The \r\ncompositions are certainly progressive related. I find the Somewhere in Time album a bit \r\nfaster than the Powerslave one. There are some excellent backing vocals like on \"Heaven \r\ncan wait\" and \"Alexander the Great\". There are many slightly echoed guitar solos, and the \r\nlong one on \"Alexander the Great\" is absolutely memorable. <p>Rating: 4.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93550#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93550\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93550\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 5, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93550)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9486\"><strong>Cristi</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Crossover / Prog Metal Teams</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9486\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/9486/12032204_10153127475862308_2338569412835506363_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n    Iron Maiden's Somewhere in Time is my favourite IM album; it's different from the\r\nother previous albums, mature and complex. After a strong album such as Powerslave\r\nand an amazing live album (IMHO) Life after Death, the band needed to comfirm their\r\n\"rock giants\" status; they surely did, and the '86 album comfirmed their value. There\r\naren't any filler songs here; the use of keyboards is great and a surprise to all\r\nfans (at that time). From the first song to the last, the musicianship is amazing,\r\nthe guitar duo Murray/Smith doing an outstanding job (again IMHO). Bruce Dickinson's\r\nvocals sound fresher and better than ever; the rhytms section bass/drums worked\r\ngreat. And we all know what Steve Harris is capable of when he picks up his bass\r\nguitar and his work on this album makes no exceptin - an excellent work.<p>   All these being said, I highly recommend this album to all prog-rock and\r\nprog-metal fans everywhere, get this album quickly if you have the chance, you won't\r\nregret it. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94679#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=94679\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=94679\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 16, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #94679)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n3.8 stars<p>Somewhere in Time is marks a progression within a band that will later lead into\r\ntheir highly-acclaimed \"Seventh Son of the Seventh Son\". I believe Somewhere in Time\r\nis a transitional album with the band experimenting with a more symphonic sound, with\r\nthe help of guitar synths that sound like keyboards. This album is in my opinion\r\ntheir most enjoyable album since the debut. <p><strong> Caught Somewhere in Time </strong> is an energetic and sophisticated composition that\r\nis worthy of opening the album. From the beginning, you can hear the guitar synths\r\nworking well with the introductory guitar melody. A big portion of the song is\r\ndevoted in guitar soloing. <strong> Wasted Years </strong> is a relatively simple mid-paced\r\ntrack focused on melodies. <strong> Sea of Madness </strong> is another melodic tune but with a\r\nfaster pace and a darker tone. The guitar playing is very good here. <strong> Heaven Can\r\nWait </strong> is an interesting song, with catchy melodies and a wonderful section with a\r\nsort of \"football-chant\" melody on top of guitar soloing. <strong> The Loneliness of a\r\nLong Distance Runner </strong> is a good long song with a great instrumental section. <strong>\r\nStranger in a Strange Land </strong> is another of those tunes with well-constructed\r\nchoruses, but this one has a wonderful instrumental section with good use of the\r\nguitar synths. A guitar solo plays at the end, which is something new for Maiden. <strong>\r\nDeja-vu </strong> is a nice fast-paced rocker. I especially like the guitar melody after\r\nits choruses.<p><strong> Alexander the Great </strong> is the highlight of the album and their \"proggiest\" song\r\nup to this point. IT is very classical in terms of arrangements, as it is supposed to\r\ntake you back in time. It begins with a military kind of beat and a nice and soft\r\nguitar solo, then the beat progresses and a wonderful guitar melody prepares you for\r\nthe song. The synths are prominent in this song, very effectively used. The\r\nsongwriting in the verses-choruses are excellent Afterwards, an fast paced\r\ninstrumental with guitar noodling tricks you with its shifting time signatures until\r\nwhen you least expect it, an incredibly full and heavy guitar solo floors you. The\r\ninstrumental continues with guitar melodies and a very long guitar solo that is very\r\ngood. Another verse/chorus finishes the song.<p>I highly recommend this album for any progger interested in knowing what Iron Maiden\r\nis all about. This album is an excellent blend of both their sides: the energetic and\r\nthe sophisticated. You won't have brainless 3-minute rockers nor a long dullfest that\r\nis \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104748#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104748\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=104748\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 28, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #104748)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1003\"><strong>chessman</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1003\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/eye_storm.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI just got the remastered and expanded versions of this, and Seventh Son, for \u00a310 the \r\ntwo at musiczone. A wonderful bargain!\r\nNow, I am no fan of heavy metal, and not a particular fan of most of Maiden's output. \r\nTracks like 'Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter' leave me cold.\r\nBut this album is different. It certainly has progressive elements, and whilst the guitars are \r\nriffing and screaming, as befits the genre, they also provide some subtle touches at times, \r\nand Steve Harris' bass playing is a delight.\r\nEvery track here has something of value in it; no weak songs on this album.\r\nMelody is in abundance all over the place, and Bruce sounds really powerful and at the top \r\nof his game here.\r\nMy favourite track must be the epic 'Alexander The Great' which closes the record, \r\nbut 'Sea Of Madness' and 'Stranger In A Strange Land' run it close.\r\nMy least favourite is probably 'The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner' but even that \r\nsong is highly listenable and has some excellent playing on it.\r\nAll the songs contribute to the atmosphere on this album, yet all are different enough to \r\nremain in the memory long after the cd has stopped, and you may well find yourself \r\nhumming segments from different tracks to yourself for days after!\r\nHighly recommended!\r\nAlthough not strictly prog, it is still a strong four star album.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106448#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=106448\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=106448\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, January 7, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #106448)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe eighties were a great time to be an IRON MAIDEN fan, from 1982-1988 they put out 5 \r\nclassic albums. \"Somewhere In Time\" is a melodic and reflective record from the band that is \r\none of my favourites.The futuristic album cover is pretty cool as well.<p>\r\n\"Caught Somewhere In Time\" opens with an interesting guitar melody, and the bass lines are \r\ngreat ! The melody picks up tempo until were galloping.The interlude is filled with some \r\nfantastic guitar solos. \"Wasted Years\" is my favourite song on the record. It's so melodic, as \r\nthey look back on the good times. What an uplifting tune ! Again like the opening song the \r\ninstrumental interlude is amazing. \"Sea Of Madness\" opens with a flury of drums and some \r\nfat bass in this heavier song. We are treated to some screaming guitar as well. Steve Harris \r\nis all over this song.<p>\"Heaven Can Wait\" is an uptempo rocker that isn't as good as the first \r\nthree. \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\" opens with tranquil guitar that is blown \r\naway by fast paced drums and guitar. Being a long distance runner myself this song has \r\nspecial meaning. \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" has lots of heavy drums and riffs. When Bruce \r\nsings of the\" land of ice and snow\" I can totally relate to that right now up here in \r\nCanada. \"De ja vu\" has a haunting intro that turns into a fast paced tune. \"Alexander The \r\nGreat\" has a nice relaxed guitar melody while the drums pound away.The song picks up \r\nspeed as Dickinson's great vocals come in.The guitar melodies are beautiful and the bass is \r\nfantastic !<p>\r\nFor me this is just a notch below \"Powerslave\" but it's no less a masterpiece.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=109847#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=109847\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=109847\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, January 30, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #109847)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8266\"><strong>Melomaniac</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8266\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070809_163315_cover_183172332.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nRight after the release of their most successful studio album at that time and following \r\nwhat might be one of the biggest tour in those days, Iron Maiden took some time off... \r\nwell, most of Iron Maiden anyway.  Adrian Smith was working on writing the majority of \r\nwhat would become Somewhere in Time.  Having reached the top of their game with \r\nPowerslave, it was time to try something a bit different.  Guitar synths and keyboards \r\nwere thrown in, and to amazing results, though many fans were bewildered at this bold \r\nmove at first.  What cannot be denied, anyhow, is the effect this album has had on the \r\ndevelopment of metal, and is definitely what should be considered as a proto prog-\r\nmetal album, if not the first modern prog-metal album.<p>From the opening notes of Caught Somewhere in Time, Maiden makes it clear ; they \r\nhave made something new and exciting, yet they still have their trademarks : dual \r\nguitar harmonies, thomping and clacking bass lines, tempo changes, high caliber \r\nmusicianship and intelligent songwriting.  We find an energized and original Nicko \r\nMcBrain, giving it his all.  And what about Bruce Dickinson ?  He delivers what I consider \r\nto be his finest vocal recording ever, and that throughout the album.<p>On with the songs.  Caught Somewhere in Time kicks of the album with an amazing \r\nguitar harmony, complete with synth guitars.  The intro then incorporates drums and \r\nbass, climaxing into the song's main pattern at high velocity.  Amazing theatrical vocal \r\nperformance courtesy of Dickinson.  And the band are up to it : intricate arrangments, \r\ntime signature changes, great solos.  The addition of sinth guitars adds A LOT to the \r\natmosphere of this song, and throughout the album.<p>Wasted Years is the most popular single off Somewhere in Time, and I understand it \r\nthough it must be my least favorite song from this album, even though I love it (and \r\nthat says it all about an album, when you enjoy even your less favorite track).  The \r\nmain guitar motif has become an anthem.  Anyway, the song is a straight-forward hard \r\nrocking tune with beautiful arrangments and, again, wonderful vocals.<p>Sea of Madness is a gem.  You know when bands make a song that is different from \r\nwhat they usually do and are incredibly successful doing it ?  That's the case here.  \r\nHard rocking and galloping when it needs to be, uplifting and beautiful in other \r\nmoments, all the while offering a great display of musicianship and mastery of their \r\ncraft.  A truly progressive song.  <p>Another anthem is found in Heaven Can Wait, a classic Harris penned number with a \r\ngreat sing along chorus.  The band takes us, once again on a few mood swings \r\nthroughout this song.<p>The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner is a very fast song, bringing to mind the \r\nstrides of a runner in a race.  The song is so relentless you can almost feel breathless \r\nwhen it ends.  Great arrangments and vocals here too, and McBrain never gives up in \r\nthis one.  I suspect he is the runner here.<p>Next comes another gem (as in my description above), Stranger in a Strange Land.  \r\nRight from the start, you cannot help but either headbang or tap your foot, and when \r\nthe guitars kick in, you just do it harder.  Such a mean and original riff!!!  The \r\nambiences created through the song are amazing, as is the way the song builds up.<p>Dave Murray's only penned number on SiT, D\u00e9j\u00e0-Vu, is another great track, not unlike \r\nThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (if I am not mistaken, they share the same \r\nbpm).  It is surprising this song fits so well in the context of the album considering it was \r\nMurray's only contribution.  <p>What better way to end an album than an epic ?  Alexander The Great is a biographical \r\nresume as much as it is an amazing epic, complete with time changes, odd time \r\nsignatures, complex arrangments and yet again an amazing deliver from Dickinson.  <p>The production fits the theme of the album, and at that time was unlike anything \r\npreviously heard.  Futuristic, spacey, yet hard and heavy.  <p>This is one of Maiden's really prog albums, and as such, deserves a rating as a prog \r\nalbum alone.  Considering the lasting influence this album has on prog, metal and prog \r\nmetal, considering the groundbreaking factor and the amazing quality of the material \r\npresented here and the high caliber of every musician involved, this album deserves \r\nnothing less than five stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=121421#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=121421\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=121421\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, May 9, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #121421)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWithout a doubt, this album has one of the best covers in all the Iron Maiden/Eddy \r\ncatalogue, with a futuristic approach and even some irony. Not that this matters that \r\nmuch for a musical standpoint, but I thought I had to mention Maiden's covers at least \r\nonce in my series of reviews. <p>This album arrived two years after the preceding one, POWERSLAVE, which means that \r\nfor one year there was no new studio record by the British. 1985 only viewed the \r\nrelease of LIVE AFTER DEATH, Maiden's first proper live album and one that would \r\ncapture the hearts of its fans even more. It seems that that hiatus from the \r\ncompositional stage worked, as SOMEWHERE IN TIME is, in my eyes, far superior to \r\nPOWERSLAVE, to the point that it may well be, alongside SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH \r\nSON, my favorite Maiden disc with Dickinson on vocals. <p>This album presents a slight change of style in Iron Maiden's music. If the focal point of \r\nthe music in POWERSLAVE seemed to be speed and energy, in this record we find, \r\nalongside fast, pure-adrenaline tracks, more atmospheric moments,  more use of the \r\nguitar synth, and a couple of songs which are absolutely progressive, maybe the first \r\nones since \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\" and much more so. The use of textures, of \r\nguitar harmonies, the dialogues between the two guitars get more complex, more \r\ninteresting; Harris' bass continues to astound with its marvelous mix of simplicity and \r\nvirtuosism; McBrain's drumming is just as tight as always but he seems more secure in \r\nthis album, like if he finally felt himself 100% a part of Iron Maiden. And one of the \r\nfactors that I love the most about this band is showcased here to a great extent: the \r\nability to create ultra-fast metal pieces but filled with lots of catchy, even beautiful \r\nmelodies. If there is something that no metal band has managed to do is to write fast \r\nmusic so tuneful. All the bands that have hopelessly tried to emulate Maiden (mostly \r\npower metal and progressive metal outfits) are yet to match the wonderful experience \r\nthat some tracks in this album can produce in a fan, that sense of hearing music that \r\n<em>belongs to you</em>, metal that's yours. A fan gets to become one with the songs, \r\nand the songs are designed to do that. More on that later.<p> Caught Somewhere In Time (9/10) A typical Maiden-esque melody in guitars opens this \r\nfast track that, unlike most Maiden openers, lasts over 5 minutes. The main verse is \r\nfaster, like a horse galloping at full speed the bass takes us through this journey. At \r\nevery moment we're dazzled by short but glorious little melodies by the guitars. \r\nDickinson sings even better than usual here. It has a long instrumental section with a \r\ngreat guitar solo and some truly inspired bass work. Another fantastic opener by the \r\nIrons, maybe not as instantly memorable as others like \"Aces High\", but surely more \r\ncomplex and easy to grow with time.  <p> Wasted Years (10/10) Not much can be said about this anthem of anthems in the \r\nalready-full-of-anthems catalogue of The Beast. Speed, energy, beautiful guitar \r\nmelodies, a sense of weird melancholy and nostalgia, the years that passed us by are \r\ngone and the song makes us pay them homage but also leave them as relics of an \r\nancient, dead past, making us look for the future. Smith and Murray just blow their \r\naxes away with a magnificent display of guitar playing and one of the best solos in the \r\nband's catalogue. The chorus can't be more memorable. This song is the stuff of \r\nlegends. The first song ever by Maiden that I need the urge to give a 10/10 to, but \r\ncertainly won't be the last (as my chronologically-wrong review of FEAR OF THE DARK \r\ncan easily attest). <p> Sea Of Madness (9.5/10) The opening verse of this song is quite unique, the rhythm \r\nhas a certain weird groove to it. The chorus is very good again, but the relentless stop-\r\nand-go main riff of the song is what truly makes it instantly recognizable. The middle \r\nsection is slow and quiet, more melodic, atmospheric almost, with another great display \r\nof prowess by Harris. Great song. Another grower. <p> Heaven Can Wait (10/10) This track may well be THE anthem by Maiden, and in this \r\ncase almost <strong>literally</strong> so. It starts very quietly, haunting, only strings (bass \r\nand guitars it's what I mean; they work with strings after all). Then another energetic \r\nverse with a breathless delivery by master Dickinson. The chorus is very likeable but \r\nrather generic. The song is going great but as it is up to this point would be just \r\nanother good fast song. Then we start going upwards, the guitars stars dueling with \r\neach other, the battle seems unstoppable. A sudden change in speed, a little slower, \r\nDickinson sings and then we're invited to join in a true <em>anthemic</em> moment made \r\nfor stadium chants and for uniting all the thousands of fans of The Beast. A moment \r\nthat, if maybe not incredibly fantastic from a musical point of view, some may see it as \r\ncheesy, but is just magical because it unites the music and the fan, both are made into \r\none. The speed comes back and the guitars' fight reaches a climax where neither one \r\nseem to be able to win, and they just join forces, as we already did with this music. This \r\nrollercoaster of a songs started like a regular decent track and by the end became one \r\nof the all-time greats by The Beast. <p> The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner (9.5/10) The beginning of this song sounds \r\nlike future albums like THE X-FACTOR will sound. The bass goes up and down, one \r\nguitar plays chords, the other a soaring high melody while the hi-hat provides the touch \r\nof heart-less mathematics to such a warm start. The main verse \r\nstarts, Dickinson delivers as usual, some great double melodies by the guitars ensue, \r\nmelody after melody. Excellent.   <p> Stranger In A Strange Land (8.5/10) The bass and the drums open this one in unusual \r\nfashion, and then the guitars come in and we're fooled for a second into believing this is \r\na ZZTop track (please, stop the violence, only for A SECOND). The use of guitar synths \r\nis clear here, the song is not so fast as the preceding ones, but is more atmospheric, \r\neven futuristic at moments. The texturing work is just great as in every track in this \r\nalbum. The chorus is good, not great. This song is another proof as to the \r\nprogressiveness in Maiden's metal. (Harris' most important influences were Squire and \r\nRutherford among others, as he himself has recognized and, most importantly, as the \r\nmusic SHOWS.) Very good slow track. Only the slightly average chorus deters it from \r\nbeing excellent.   <p> D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (9.5/10) Another slow, melodic start where the three string-based electric \r\ninstruments seem to dialogue with each other. And then suddenly one of those \r\nlegendary lightning-fast riffs by The Beast attacks. McBrain adds to the energy while \r\nDickinson forces his throat to the limits. A fantastic fast track, very melodic all the \r\ncraziness notwithstanding. At moments sounds like a <em>\"progged-up\"</em> version \r\nof \"Killers\", the title track of Maiden's sophomore release.  <p> Alexander The Great (10/10) The longest and most progressive song in SOMEWHERE \r\nIN TIME, it starts like a slow march filled with evil, dark spirits. Guitar melodies fly over \r\nthe marching snare-drum rhythm and the pedal. Then the main verse comes into scene. \r\nThe tempo is similar to that of \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" in POWERSLAVE, but the \r\nsong as a whole is much more progressive, varied, complex. Instrumental sections \r\nabound, guitar solos inhabit this epic track as the most honorable of citizens of the land \r\nof melodic metal. Another superb song that deserves a perfect rating, even if it hasn't \r\nreached my heart as much as the other two, but maybe that's because of exposure, as \r\nthis is another example of why I love Maiden. <p> This album is better than almost any other in all of Iron Maiden's catalogue (bar, in my \r\nopinion, SEVENTH SON and X-FACTOR), but it's definitely a \"grower\": one has to give it \r\ntime, and it will grow; one has to give it a few listens, an it will show its true face. The \r\nfirst true masterpiece by The Beast, it gets a 5 from me, and I think the rating is in \r\naccordance to PA guidelines, for this is a true <em>progressive</em> album. <p>Recommended for: Every Iron Maiden fan and every Metal fan. But give it time to grow \r\nwith you as it did with me.<p>. and be ready to chant in communion with The Beast, and tell Heaven that it will have \r\nto wait... at least till you finish listen to SOMEWHERE IN TIME.  \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126561#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126561\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=126561\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, June 22, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #126561)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12866\"><strong>Prog Leviathan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12866\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12866/Capture.PNG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nA very slick and highly polished Iron Maiden release with a classy sound and line up of songs, creative guitar work, and clever use of \r\nthe band's varied talents; however, none of the songs here have the staying power or memorability of other releases, \r\nmaking \"Somewhere in Time\" a good, but sometimes forgettable record when placed alongside the band's library.

It\r\nwas very original in its day, as the band switched to synth guitars on this album and were among the first band to use that\r\ninstrument in a way that enhanced their sound. At the same time the synth sounds alienated many fans, of which quite a few\r\nwould say that this album showed a band in creative and musical decline.<p>Musically the band has perfected their sound on this album. The playing is tighter than the proverbial duck's arse, and the\r\nband members are experienced enough to add the extra touches to ordinary tunes to make them sound good, adding small nuances\r\nand touches in turn to make the songs sound interesting; as can best be heard on opening track \"Caught Somewhere in Time\". \r\nAdding the synth sounds to the music also elevates many tracks from the realm of the ordinary to something better, where the\r\nslightly softer edges of the synth guitar riffs adds flavout and atmosphere to Iron Maidens trademark harmonic and melodic\r\nsoloing and riffing, and giving a warmer touch to Maidens pacey songs, where the fast paced bass guitar and drumming do sound\r\nbetter accompanied by the slightly softer synth guitars.<p>A new aspect to Iron Maiden's sound on this album, or at least an aspect much developed here, are several examples of songs\r\nwhere Bruce Dickinson's vocals are used as a melodic instrument in itself. These songs are rather monotone and repetitive\r\napart from the soloing, and Dickinson's vocals carry as good as all melody in the singing parts of these songs. \"Wasted\r\nYears\" is a very good example of this. If this is planned or more an indirect result of the synth guitars slighter fuzzy\r\nsound is of course something that only can be speculated upon.<p>The influence from progressive rock continues on this album as well; an aspect of their music surfacing on their previous\r\nstudio album \"Powerslave\". As with that album, in many songs the progressive elements are more to be found in structure than\r\nin actual playing; and the elements are most noticeable in the long, epic tracks on this release.<p>The individual songs on \"Somewhere in Time\" are a rather mixed affair. Although musically at their peak now in my opinion,\r\nthe songs as such aren't as good as on previous albums. The creative well seems to have run dry; with fewer songs than normal\r\ncontaining original or really captivating elements.<p>The addition of the synth guitars to their sound as well as the band members ability to play on individual and collective\r\nstrengths are the factors that elevate this album to an interesting, albeit varied, release.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=136126#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=136126\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=136126\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, September 4, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #136126)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSame sort of recipe as in \"Powerslave\" (their previous albums) : longer compositions, more hard-rock than metal oriented and \r\nvery little prog to my ears. I am only amazed to read about the progressiveness of this album (or band).<p>Would you ask back in 1985 to which genre Iron Maiden's music was related, I bet you that NO ONE would have linked it with \r\nprog, that's for sure. Did they become prog with the remastering of their albums ? .Strange. Although the same progressive \r\ntrends have invaded lots of bands which were never considered as such before. I must have missed their reconversion.<p>Anyway, this is another very good Maiden album. To be faithful to your roots was not an easy task in those mid eighties but \r\nMaiden did it remarkably. It is difficult to find a weak number in here. The album opens brilliantly on the title track which is one of \r\nthe highlight.<p>If you are in need of energy : grab this album (or another earlier Maiden one like \"Killers\"). You will be rejuvenated. A killer song \r\nas \"Heaven Can Wait\" will just beat you down. Great chorus, majestic guitar work and incredible beat. Extremely powerful.<p>I would have rather titled the next song \"The Loneliness Of The Short Distance Runner\", because one can hardly believe a long \r\ndistance one can run as fast as the amazing beat available here. It is one of my fave from this album. Fantastic guitars again and \r\nSUPER fast rhythm. Almost punkish. But that's not the first time that Maiden flirts with this genre. Another highlight.<p>The heaviest song is not the best one available : \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" has a slower-paced tempo (but I agree that it is \r\ndifficult to remain on the levels of the other songs so far). This type of tracks usually doesn't please me a lot (whatever the \r\nband). I prefer energetic to heavy. Bizarrely, an atmospheric break is the start of a brilliant (guitar) solo. So, my judgement \r\nabout it is mixed.<p>Smooth guitar to open \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" which will be very soon converted into a fast metal mood. Drumming here is very good. \r\nCountless hits on the drum kit all the way the way through. Very effective song and nice vocals-guitar interplays.<p>The closing number is also a highlight. Starts on a bolero-like mood (but this doesn't make a song prog, even if the riff \r\nof \"Watcher Of The Skies\" from who you know is seriously borrowed around minute four). A good overview of the history of this \r\ngreat conqueror and an epic metal track.<p>This album will please any Maiden fan. It is purely in the band's trradition. No real change with this work. Four stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=153278#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=153278\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=153278\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, November 30, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #153278)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15928\"><strong>progrules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15928\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15928/cover_1325619920091.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI wanted to review this for a long time and now I finally urged myself to do it. I still have many prog albums to go but now it's Iron \r\nMaiden time. Is Iron Maiden prog of any kind ? Personally I don't think so, but if there's an album that comes close it could well be \r\nthis one. This was my absolute favourite hard rock album of the eighties. Really good and inventive compositions for a simple (?) \r\nhard rock band I thought back then. But if I see the number of reviews on this website for this band and the ratingaverages they \r\nscore you really start to believe this is prog (related).<p>Anyway, now about this album. I'll start with the highlight which is the last track of the album: Alexander the Great. I'm in love with \r\nthis song for over 20 years now and it will probably never go away. It must have something to do with the progressive elements you \r\ncan find in it. The instrumental part is mindblowing and suits me 100%. Unfortunately none of the other tracks can keep up with this \r\nclass act but still there are several real nice ones, like Stranger in a strange land, Heaven can wait and Sea of madness. And actually \r\nthe others aren't bad at all either. So it's not really hard for me to come to the 4 star conclusion. Great effort by Iron Maiden.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155279#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155279\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=155279\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 13, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #155279)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20541\"><strong>Negoba</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20541\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20541/devin1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis was the first actual metal I owned, after hearing Wasted Years and being impressed by the opening \r\nguitar lead riff. While Bruce Dickinson is a focal point of sorts, this album showcases all of the band \r\nmembers on the top of their game, well balanced, executing well, and full of energy. Where some of the \r\nearlier albums may have rocked harder, they always had a looseness to them that didn't appeal to my \r\nmusicality (Run to the Hills is a great example), and the subsequent album was almost poppy to my \r\nears, Somewhere in Time struck the right balance.<p>Is it prog? No. Is it as sophisticated as much of the material in our Prog Metal category. Yes. And just as \r\nwell executed. Further, I think Iron Maiden influenced those bands perhaps more than any other. Certainly \r\nmy old favorite, Queensryche, started as a Maiden clones, and in fact one of the classic riffs from Eye of \r\na Stanger resembles the signature riff from Somewhere in Time to a suspicious degree.<p>My favorite songs from this album: Caught Somewhere in Time, Wasted Years, Stranger in a Strange \r\nLand<p>Least favorite Deja Vu</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=186282#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=186282\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=186282\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 18, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #186282)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<em>Somewhere In Time</em> is the sixth full-length studio album by UK heavy metal act \r\n<B>Iron Maiden</B>. <B>Iron Maiden</B> had enjoyed great success with their previous \r\nalbum <em>Powerslave (1984)</em> and the ensuing world tour in 1984-1985. Listening to \r\n<em>Somewhere In Time</em> it\u00b4s fortunately quite obvious that they had no intention of \r\nslowing down or abdicate the heavy metal throne in favour of new forces at this point. In \r\nother words they had not become lazy or tired because of success. <em>Somewhere In \r\nTime</em> is another great album in a long line of classic heavy metal albums by <B>Iron \r\nMaiden</B> but there\u00b4s something different about the sound on this one compared to \r\nearlier releases by the band that makes <em>Somewhere In Time</em> one of the most unique \r\nstudio albums yet by <B>Iron Maiden</B>.<p>The music on the album is at its core melodic heavy metal as on any other album release \r\nby <B>Iron Maiden</B>, so the basis in the music with <B>Bruce Dickinson\u00b4s</B> powerful \r\nand distinct vocals, the thunderous ( read: Galloping) rythm section and the twin lead guitar \r\nattack is as present as ever. The difference between <em>Somewhere In Time</em> and earlier \r\nreleases by <B>Iron Maiden</B> is that <em>Somewhere In Time</em> actually moves slightly \r\ninto progressive territory. The use of synth guitars and a general epic atmosphere on the \r\nalbum helps on that impression. <p>There are eight tracks on the album. Three are written by guitarist <B>Adrian Smith</B> \r\nwhile the last five are written by bassist <B>Steve Harris</B>. <B>Bruce Dickinson</B> had \r\nwritten songs for the album but the rest of the band favoured the songs written by \r\n<B>Adrian Smith</B> and <B>Steve Harris</B>. <em>Wasted years</em> and <em>Stranger In A \r\nStrange Land</em> were used as A-sides for the two EPs released to promote the album. All \r\nsongs on the album are of high quality and while it\u00b4s almost impossible for me to pick out \r\nfavorites I\u00b4ll give a special mention to opener <em>Caught Somewhere In Time</em>, the fast \r\npaced <em>The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner</em>, the melancholic/ nostalgic \r\nsounding <em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em> and the grand epic closer <em>Alexander The \r\nGreat</em>. All songs on the album leave me awe strucken though and a great feeling of joy \r\nalways overwhelms me when I listen to <em>Somewhere In Time</em>. While I mentioned the \r\nword progressive above, the music on <em>Somewhere In Time</em> really isn\u00b4t progressive \r\nmetal and shouldn\u00b4t be regarded as such. There are many progressive elements on the \r\nalbum though that has been greatly influential on the progressive metal genre and should I \r\npoint to one album by the band that warrants <B>Iron Maiden\u00b4s</B> inclusion on a \r\nprogressive rock site it would definitely be <em>Somewhere In Time</em>.<p>The production by <B>Martin Birch</B> has a grand and clean futuristic sound that goes \r\nvery well with the extensive use of synth guitars and the sci-fi theme on the album. One of \r\nthe most unique heavy metal productions I have ever heard. It\u00b4s very different from the \r\nsound on earlier albums by <B>Iron Maiden</B>.<p>My own story with <em>Somewhere In Time</em> probably has some effect on my final rating \r\non the album. Not only is this an absolutely fantastic album but it was actually my first ever \r\nLP purchase ( I had some cassettes but an LP is something special IMO). I get all \r\nnostalgic thinking about that purchase. I even remember which store I purchased the \r\nalbum in. Putting that LP into an empty shelf ( which would soon be full) in my now long \r\ngone teenage bookcase is something I will treasure forever. My copy of the album actually \r\nturned out to have an error in the first song on Side 2 <em>The Loneliness Of A Long \r\nDistance Runner</em> which means that the needle jumps. Very annoying and I of course \r\nwent to the store where I had purchased the album and made them give me a new copy. \r\nThe only problem was that the new copy had exactly the same error and I gave up trying to \r\nget a new one. It must have been a whole shipment to Denmark with LP copies of \r\n<em>Somewhere In Time</em> with the same error because my brother has a copy with the \r\nsame error and two of my friends have copies with the same error too. I\u00b4ve since \r\npurchased <em>Somewhere In Time</em> in both a flawless LP version and on CD but \r\nfortunately my first meeting with the album didn\u00b4t take away the fact that I enjoyed this \r\nalbum very much the first couple of years after I purchased it. There have been times when I \r\nhaven\u00b4t listened much to <B>Iron Maiden</B> but this is the album I always return to when \r\nthe urge to listen to some great melodic heavy metal comes over me.

At the moments where Maiden comes up with adequate songs it works\r\nsuccessfully, but there's just too much filler and big sing-along choruses to make up a good album. <p>On the opening <em>Caught Somewhere In Time</em> everything they do is superb though, only the chorus\r\nis a bit grating to my ears. It's a pattern that returns in much of the songs. Only <em>Stranger In A\r\nStrange Land</em> fully convinces me. Most songs are average at best, featuring unremarkable verses\r\nand bridges and choruses that vary between inadequate and commercial. Also <em>Alexander The\r\nGreat</em> doesn't speak to me.<p>I remember this album didn't click with the fans back in 1985 but going by the ratings that seems\r\nnot to be the case for the prog crowd.  One thing is sure, from the next album onwards, Maiden\r\nre-turned to the <em>Powerslave</em> formula and gradually became a self-derivative and irrelevant\r\nband. Here, at least they tried. It can't convince me a bit really. 2.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260771#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260771\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=260771\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, January 14, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #260771)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden - Somewhere in Time (1986)<p>\r\nIn a time 'progressive' was a cursed word Iron Maiden changed their direction in exactly that \r\ndirection.  This somewhat strange move for one of the most popular metal band of their \r\ntimes wasn't perceived as a progress by the fans, but in our progressive community it was \r\nseen as a pleasant career-move. Might Harris had always intended to extend his melodic \r\nand inventive ideas for the band? Perhaps the roots for this new style can be found in the \r\nnew technology of it's time (synth-bass and synth-guitar). I don't know, but I learned to like \r\nthis one-of-a-kind album in their discography. <p>On the Somewhere in Time album the metal-sound got some electronic edge to it and there \r\nnow was a frequent use of synthesizers, albeit guitars-synths. The vocals of Dickinson are \r\nless close to the listener due to the use of reverb effects. The sound of this album is also a \r\nbit more abstract and perhaps a bit spacey to some. The drums are still recognizable \r\nMaiden style.<p>The songs. The album opens with the title track and to be honest, it's not my favorite track of \r\nthe album. I know a lot of people who really like it, but I think it sounds un-interesting and the \r\nmelodies just don't seem to work. Even some of the guitar-solo's don't work for me, usually \r\na strong part of the Maiden title tracks. A pity. The next track, Wasted years, is a stronger \r\ntrack with a nice guitar theme and a catchy refrain. It's slight electronic sound works really \r\nwell here. Sea of Madness is a bit more progressive and has a great bridge and refrain. The \r\nlyrics are bit dull IMHO. <p>Heaven Can Wait is the first masterful Maiden track on the album. This epical track about a \r\nnear-death-experience has many parts put together in an intelligent and fresh way. The \r\nmany guitarsolo's work well and the atmosphere works pretty well with the lyrics. Great! The \r\nLoneliness Of A Long Distance Runner is a song with a lot of instrumental guitar parts that \r\nwork very well with the up-tempo approach. I used to think of this song as a real treat: the \r\nmore melodic guitar parts the better. Stranger In A Strange Land is a simple but effective \r\nsong like Wasted Years. Somehow the simplistic rhythmical approach (one might say kind \r\nof eighties-rock like) works very well. It give focus. <p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu is an up-tempo track with again a lot of melodic guitar parts and a good lyrical \r\ntheme. This albums keeps getting stronger! Alexander The Great is the big epic of the \r\nalbum. It has all of the epic ingredient Maiden has to offer: many melodic instrumental parts, \r\na story-line, some more development with instrumental parts (this time even in an odd time-\r\nsignature!) and a good conclusion.<p>Conclusion. A strange Maiden album with synths and a slight progressive approach. This \r\nnew slightly progressive sound is established by it's sound, Iron Maiden already had lot's of \r\ninventive songwriting and many melodic parts. Somehow I can understand this album is not \r\nfor every-one and it might not even be appreciated by all fans of the band. I myself like it, \r\nthough I think side two is better then side one. Four stars. A lot of guts to make experimental \r\nmetal like this in the mid-eighties!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284453#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284453\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284453\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, June 1, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284453)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFirst album after the proclaimed Iron Maiden trilogy that begun with <em>The Number Of The Beast</em> turned out less successful in the hits department and is generally considered to be slightly weaker than the two juggernauts that surround it. While I can understand that the fans might prefer hits like <em>Aces High</em> and <em>Two Minutes To Midnight</em> over this material, this doesn't make <em>Somewhere In Time</em> a lesser release by any means. On contrary, this actually happens to be my favorite Iron Maiden by far!<p>\r\nMy love for this record is not a nostalgic one since I've discovered it pretty recently and it wasn't even among the first batch of albums that I've heard from the band. This is a very honest and unbiased response to a solid record and a rarity within the Iron Maiden discography. Not only does the album feature most of my favorite compositions from the band but it also pretty much nails the experimental fling that I've been lacking on their previous releases.<p>\r\nRight off the bat you know that this album is special judging by the excellent album cover. I just had to buy the vinyl in order to be able to decipher all the hidden messages and clues of the band's past depicted on the front and back cover work, easily their best album cover to date! The music doesn't disappoint either. <em>Caught Somewhere In Time</em> is a magnificent album-opener that kicks the record into high gear from the get-go with the dual guitar action followed by drums and stomping bass only to let Dickinson enter more than a minute into the composition.<p>\r\n<em>Wasted Years</em> is the more commercial out of the two singles released from the album but it's really not a bad song by any means. Yes, the chorus might sound a bit cheesy to some but the instrumental arrangements make up for most of the possible flaws that some people might mention. <em>Sea Of Madness</em> and <em>Heaven Can Wait</em> are another two rather commercially oriented tracks, surprisingly neither of the two were released as a singles. Solid tracks but somewhat disappointing in the context of the rest of the album.<p>\r\nIf you feel a bit discouraged by side one of the record then fear not, side two is the far more superior of the two! <em>The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner</em> kicks things off with another signature guitar melody that will most likely get stuck in your head for days on end, I know that it did so with me. The album's second single <em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em> is really a weird but fun choice for a single since it's really not as radio-friendly as any of the tracks off side one. Luckily, it only makes me love it even more!<p>\r\nNow here is an odd number for any Iron Maiden fans who claim that the band has never played dangerously close to Power Metal. <em>D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</em> is easily the most Power Metal oriented composition that the band has released and it almost makes me imagine this whole parallel universe where Iron Maiden is a Power Metal band playing exclusively tracks like this one. Ain't that a funny thought? Time for another epic history lesson and <em>Alexander The Great</em> clearly doesn't disappoint in that regard. This is an epic composition at it's finest, everything is done here just the way I like it, even down to the odd time signature section played in 7/8.<p>\r\nEven if <em>Somewhere In Time</em> is my personal favorite among the Iron Maiden albums I'm not sure that it's the album for everyone. You should probably start your journey with <em>Powerslave</em> and then move on to either this album or the great 1980 debut release. Hopefully you'll get just the right amount of exposure to the band by going through these three albums since I've found most of their other releases to be lackluster in one regard or another.<p>***** star songs: Caught Somewhere In Time (7:26) The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner (6:31) Alexander The Great (8:37)<p>**** star songs: Wasted Years (5:07) Sea Of Madness (5:42) Stranger In A Strange Land (5:45) D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (4:56)<p>*** star songs: Heaven Can Wait (7:22)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=550840#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=550840\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=550840\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 15, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #550840)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThere's little doubt in my mind that Somewhere In Time isn't quite as good as the preceding \r\nPowerslave, but at the same time it's still a very good Maiden album which is somewhat \r\nunderrated in the band's catalogue.

But I then \r\ncollected their albums and found out their first five albums were very good. When I got this \r\nSomewhere In Time, I did find anything new coming out from their musical creativity - it's just usal \r\nstuffs - nothing new and challenging. It's still a good album even though not as powerful as its \r\npredecessor Powerslaves. The band seemed like in a stagnant period - or may be they got bored \r\nwith the music?<p>Caught Somewhere In Time is actually quite unique which demonstrates excellent Dickinson \r\nvocals with catchy chorus. Deja-Vu proves the roots of Maiden's sound with excellent guitar work \r\nfrom Murray and Smith. Alexander The Great, at over eight minutes, enjoys some moments, but \r\nunfortunately it lacks cohesion. The other remaining tracks, by Maiden standards, quite boring \r\nand not quite good, actually. Wasted Years is maybe only good to be performed live. Heaven \r\nCan Wait is also similar even though it has quite good lyrics. The Loneliness Of The Distance \r\nRunner best sounds mundane and it shows how actually the band started lacking of creativity.<p>Overall, it's still good album even though it's not as excellent as the previous five albums.

The group's first, fully-fledged attempt to integrate synthesizers and \r\nkeyboards into their powerful sound, 'Somewhere In Time' can be counted as something of a surprise \r\nsuccess. Whilst many rock bands would ultimately stain their once-proud resume's during the 1980's thanks to \r\ntheir attempts to 'stay modern'(just think Yes, Pink Floyd, Genesis...the list is endless) Iron Maiden actually \r\nmanaged to pull off the neat trick of enhancing their sound. The addition of slinky yamaha synths and hi-tech keyboards to the group's \r\nspeed-metal-inflected brand of pumping heavy rock proves a bold departure for a group whose simple-but-\r\neffective formula had seen them conquer the globe. The anthemic hooks, rousing choruses and screeching \r\nguitar solo's are still in check, the glitzy electronic edge adding a real instrumental depth to such big-sounding \r\ntracks as 'Wasted Years' and 'Heaven Can Wait', the album's stand-out moments, and the powerfully-charged \r\nSteve Harris-penned epic 'Alexander The Great' becomes a kind of proto-progressive song-suite filled with \r\natmospheric sound effects and some genuine musical grandstanding. It's all very far removed from the simplistic sound of 'Killers' and the early-eighties big-selling 'Number \r\nOf The Beast', and in some quarters is seen as a major influence of the burgeoning prog-metal scene(Just ask Queensryche). \r\nFiguratively speaking this is still heavy metal, yet the strong symphonic overtones brought about by the group's \r\nnew approach shows that Iron Maiden are much more refined outfit than their blood 'n' thunder reputation \r\nsuggests. As an album 'Somewhere In Time' still has it's flaws - 'The Loneliness Of The Long Distance \r\nRunner' drags it's feet and 'Deja Vu' seems forced and awkward - yet there is much here that will delight both die-\r\nhard fans of the group and those with more progressive tastes. Featuring a slick new direction, this is very much Iron \r\nMaiden at their most adventurous. <p>STEFAN TURNER, STOKE NEWINGTON, 2012 </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=641988#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=641988\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=641988\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, February 27, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #641988)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11239\"><strong>Sagichim</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11239\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11239/73.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHail the chorus effect!<p>I do enjoy a lot of Iron Maiden's albums and i used to like Somewhere In Time a lot once, but\r\nlistening to this now the main problem of this album is that it has no great material, the songs\r\ndoes not have the same impact on me as before. One thing that bothers me is the sound, i used to\r\nlike it before, but it's too similar sounding, the guitars are heavy chorused and does not stop, or\r\nuse a different sound at all. Dickinson's vocals are good but i don't like his operatic vocals on\r\nthis album, i like his regular vocals better. <p>Some of the material is good and some is boring, it seems Iron Maiden went for a simple formula this\r\ntime, the writing is not exciting at all and is hardly progressive. The songs contain some changes\r\nand some nice interludes, but it all sounds flat and not dynamic, most of the riffs are uninspired\r\nand that's what is bringing the whole album down. Few of the riffing are good but a lot of it is\r\njust boring 80's metal stuff. I used to like pretty much everything the guitars did in their early\r\ndays, but nothing of it is remotely close here, the solos are not memorable, they are just there\r\nbecause the song gotta have a solo right? <p>This is definitely a classic Iron Maiden album though, and fans of the Dickinson era will worship\r\nthis blindly, the band gave their fans all they want, Iron Maiden riffing, Iron Maiden vocals and\r\nIron Maiden rhythms, but it is not enough this time. I admit there are a lot of enjoyable parts here\r\nand there, about every song contains one part or two and that's the problem, the good parts are\r\nspreaded on the entire album and are far apart, I find my self waiting to hear those thirty seconds\r\nthat i like and the rest is nothing special, i would expect Iron Maiden to do better. <p>I have one song that i really like though, I knew this song before i got a copy of the album, and it\r\nremained my favorite here, 'Wasted Years' is a great song, it's different from the rest of the\r\nalbum, although i saw some reviews stating this song is cheesy and maybe the album's worst, i love\r\nit, it works, it has a good riff, good vocals, great energies and an amazing solo, just perfect. <p>I really wanted to rate this album higher but i can't, as much as i love Iron Maiden the album does\r\nnot move me anymore. Although i can not say the band is playing bad, i wish the material was much\r\nstronger, because they are a beast and overall the band does work.\r\nThe album's rating is 3 stars but i'm knocking out one star because of my personal feeling.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=760160#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=760160\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=760160\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, May 29, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #760160)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter bursting from his grave from wearing himself out from the \"Powerslave\" tour on the \"Live After\r\nDeath\" album, Eddie springs back to life and takes up time travel on IRON MAIDEN's sixth studio\r\nalbum SOMEWHERE IN TIME. Although it seems like it should be a concept album it only has a handful\r\nof tracks dedicated to time. This is the first album the band utilized synthesizers in their sound\r\nbut as a complementary background setting instead of a full-on keyboard effect. This album to me\r\nsounds like there is a lot of recycled riffage going on. There are parts here and there that clearly\r\nremind you of previous albums, but despite it all MAIDEN deliver yet another satisfying album from\r\nbeginning to end. Unfortunately this album just sinks a little between the ones surrounding it for me.<p>Despite being a tad musically inferior, I have to say that the artwork is one of the best album\r\ncovers in musical history with tons of references to previous songs, albums and themes. Derek Riggs\r\noutdid himself on this one with the Blade Runner themed sci-fi extravaganza. I was initially\r\ndisappointed that this album was not the fully formed concept album that \"Rime Of The Ancient\r\nMariner\" eluded to moving toward on the previous album. We would have to wait until the next album\r\nfor that to happen, but this is still a strong album that despite seeming a little bit like IRON\r\nMAIDEN on cruise control still has enough melody and metallic fury to satisfy.

This earned them some criticism from their most radical fans, who did not see with \r\ngood eyes that the group tested new proposals that were less harsh than those typical of heavy metal.\r\nBut Steve Harris and the rest of the band always recognized their musical influences, and hence the nods to the \r\nprogressive genre have been constant in their discography. Somewhere in Time is a demonstration of this. Without \r\nneglecting its essence, since after all, they are a group with a metal root, they give us songs of remarkable quality \r\nrelated to prog-rock.<p>To especially highlight the more than 8 minutes of the extraordinary and epic Alexander the Great, an evocation of the \r\nMacedonian king and conqueror, in my opinion, one of the best songs in the Iron Maiden discography, which has \r\nfailed to transcend more than it deserved, probably due to the initial suspicion that the album got, in addition to the \r\nfact that they never played it live. Other great songs are the painful Stranger In a Strange Land and its deep, \r\nmelancholic guitar solo, and the dynamic Wasted Years and The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner.<p>The rest of the songs, like the galloping, Caught Somewhere in Time or Heaven Can Wait, are closer to their traditional \r\nheavy metal style.<p>Time has given Somewhere in Time a much fairer place than the one it had at its release, recognizing its value as a \r\nwork of a very good level, despite the differences with their previous albums.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2457871#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2457871\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2457871\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 20, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12927#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2457871)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFresh off of the success of 1984's 'Powerslave' and the 1985 live album 'Live After Death', Iron Maiden were well and \r\nfirmly at the top of the metal world, and their run of strong releases would continue with 'Somewhere in Time', an \r\nalbum which saw the band continue to enter progressive territor\r\n...
