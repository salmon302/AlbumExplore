As a lot of people claim that this is a masterpiece , I say this is a pale copy of what they could do if they managed a personnality of their own. Everything seems to remind you of something else on here (As on most TFK albums too).<p>I always had the unfortunate feeling that most progheads elevating thios kind of album to the levels of masterpieces were fooling themselves and were trying to live out a fantasy that the this decade was living up to the 70's standards. Of course, how unfair to ask this of a group of musicians, but really, they were the ones making the records that were sounding just like what they were aiming at.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3793#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3793\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3793\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, February 23, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3793)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=100\"><strong>Marcelo</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=100\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/seahorse_animati&#111;n.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nMaybe one of the better known albums of the neo progressive, and one of those opus that can demonstrate what a band is. IMO, IQ is better than Pendragon, Marillion and many neo prog groups, but it doesn't mean a superband. \r\nGenesis-Gabriel evidently influenced, \"Subterranea\" gives us more than hundred minutes of typical neo prog music, sometimes brilliant, sometimes reiterative, with the logical modern sound and the changing tunes, but -despite the work is pleasant to listen- two discs are too long if they turn around always in the same way. \r\n\"Subterranea\" first disc is my favorite, maybe I felt a little bit bored when second disc was playing. The fourth track, \"Sleepless Incidental\", is the best song. About second disc, the long suite \"The Narrow Margin\" is interesting too, but I must confess I was tired and waiting the end.   \r\nIQ's music is melodic and enough powerful, even tough some tracks show us a little bit \"commercial\" feeling. \"Subterranea\" doesn't reach the brightness of \"The Seventh House\" but, nevertheless, this is a good stuff, and almost essential for those who love neo prog style.  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3778#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3778\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3778\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, March 4, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3778)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWOW! What a GREAT album! Please, stop pretending that this album is a \"Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" clone! Apart the fact that it lasts around 100 minutes and that it is a concept album too, \"Subterranea\" is a totally different album. <p>Near 20 tracks, most of them are not epic, except \"Narrow Margin\", which lasts around 20 minutes. The album must preferably be listened in its entirety: there are some variations on the same theme. All the tracks have something interesting. the tracks are not extremely complex, but the ambience & atmospheres created are really pleasant and addictive, and the tracks are really progressive, never monotonous. Martin Orford uses an omnipresent organ, but, unlike MARILLION - \"Brave\", it never sounds outdated. He often plays addictive fresh piano parts. His ultra modern keyboards can be very floating and atmospheric, often having the New Age style, like on \"Tunnel Vision\", \"Sense of Sanity\" and \"The Other Side\". Many tracks are really rythmic, almost prog hard rock, followed by fresh, dreamy & emotional ambient pauses. The electric guitar is very rythmic, having many melodic solos like on the \"Ever\" album. There are some excellent acoustic guitars too, which are absolutely relevant with the modern & fresh overall sound. The bass is excellent, and Jowitt sometimes plays a VERY pleasant fretless bass, like on \"Speak My Name\" and \"Capricorn\". Peter Nicholls sings well, and he does not \"MEOW\" his voice like on the \"Ever\" album. Paul Cook plays excellent slow drums parts, which is really appreciated, avoiding to sound too fast for the slow rythm: Nevertheless his parts are never dull and never simple. One must mention some great sentimental saxophone parts, like on \"Capricorn\", fitting VERY well with the modern IQ sound. The moving textures involved are REALLY accessible: this record is easy to listen! The tracks are not really depressing, much less than MARILLION - \"Brave\". All the instruments are well synchronized, and they work together, for the song, not trying to steal the show. As if all these perfect tracks were not enough, IQ managed to end it with a throbbing ultra epic masterpiece named \"Narrow Margin\"! This extremely well made track will remind you some parts of GENESIS (GABRIEL-era), especially \"Watcher of the Skies\".\r\n \r\nIQ is a band that has always progressed, and it seems they are now at their best! Finally, \"Subterranea\" has similitudes with the records \"Ever\" and \"Seventh House\"; however I find \"Subterranea\" more accessible! Definitely one of the best prog albums of the 90's. <p>EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED! \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3780#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3780\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3780\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, April 11, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3780)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=114\"><strong>richardh</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=114\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/114/af5d2032-17c8-4974-b74e-8526b424a141.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nDouble albums are notoriously difficult to pull off but IQ have a good go here.The concept and songs make a good deal of sense and they never reduce anything to mere ramblings.Great headphone 'stuff'!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3781#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3781\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3781\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, April 29, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3781)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4698\"><strong>loserboy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=4698\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/4698/albumcover1.gif\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nVery much in the vein of GENESIS, \"Subterrenea\" explores the deep and dark aspects of \r\nmetropolitan life. Like \"The Lamb\", \"Subterrenea\" uses a 2 record set to accomplish this \r\nconcept-like story, however, this is where the similarities end. IQ bring their own unique \r\nsound to the forefront and push the boundaries of prog music yet again. The intro alone \r\nwill sell you on the release as orchestration is mixed with electric instruments giving an epic \r\nfeel to the whole recording. Each song is built on the storyline and is very well presented \r\nand packaged. This is very well recorded and sound seperation is quite good on the ol' \r\nstereo. This is IQ's most challenging project yet and needs to be heard in its entirety.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3782#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3782\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3782\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 17, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3782)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=378\"><strong>Cesar Inca</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n'Subterranea' is not only my all-time favourite IQ's effort, but also my favourite concept-\r\ndisc from the 90s. From day one I was captivated by the somber, mysterious ambience \r\nportrayed all along this album... even months before I became aware of the dramatic \r\nnarrative that unifies the lyrical contents of the sung tracks. The repertoire focuses most \r\nof its strngth on well defined melodic lines, helped by arrangements that are dealt with \r\nboth finesse and contemporary sensibility: sure there's enough amount of rhythm and \r\nmood twists, but they are not as prominent as on previous albums by the band (like 'Tales' \r\nor 'Ever', for instance). The instrumentalists' common attitude is that of creating a sort of \r\nOST for the \" virtual movie\" that surfaces from the storyline. That explains the presence of \r\nethereal layers on synth and guitar synth ('Provider', the coda of 'Sleepless Incidental', the \r\nfinal sections of 'Tunnel Vision' and 'Breathtaker', the marimba-like synth on 'Sense in \r\nSanity') and effective instrumental interludes (the dreamy 'The Other Side', the \r\nbombastic 'State of Mine'): some critics have noted down that there are some allegedly \r\nannoying instrumental fillers in 'Subterranea', but I appreciate them (and don't call \r\nthem \"fillers\") as what they are, transitional moments between a crucial \"scene\" and the \r\nfollowing one. Nicholls' vocal performance reaches the same level of excellence and \r\nemotional commitment as in 'Ever', though not as overwhelming, since in 'Subterranea' he \r\ntells us a story (while in 'Ever' the subjects were more directly personal). Orford's and \r\nHolmes' performances are as precise and energetic as always, but definitely, in adding \r\nsome clear touches of avant-garde tricks (somewhat inspired by the industrial wave), the \r\nguitar/keyboard ensamble feels particularly \"modern\". The rhythm section sounds a bit \r\nrockier, in comparison to the preceding effort, providing a well-oiled foundation for their \r\npartners. Mi fav tracks are 'Sleepless Incidental', 'Failsafe', 'Infernal Chorus', 'Somewhere \r\nin Time', and the closing 20 minute long epic 'The Narrow Margin'... and let's not forget the \r\neerie ballad 'Speak My Name', which incarnates an oasis of emotional candor in the middle \r\nof the overall obscure nature of the repertoire. All things considered, this repertoire needs to be appreciated as an entire unit, since the presence of some recurring themes serves as the spinal tap that sustains its integral coherence. My conclusion: the exhibition of tight musicianship, emotional singing and refined writing in 'Subterranea' makes it IMHO a prog gem of our times.  <p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3794#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3794\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3794\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, June 4, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3794)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nMy friend, Tom Malik, just lent me a DVD titled as \"The Enigma of KASPAR HAUSER\", a \r\nGermany movie production based on a true story. \"Watch this movie as this is a real \r\nstory that inspires IQ in SUBTERRANEA album\", Tom said to me. I did watch the movie. \r\nThat's why it's about time now to review this seminal work of IQ. <p>This album deserves for \"detail\" review as this concept album is a brilliant product that \r\nhas ever been made by the band. I own this album since its day of release but I refrain \r\nmyself to review it because it's so special album. Even, I think, this long review won't be \r\nenough to cover all.<p>Before I discuss in detail about this album, I need to clear some issues up front. I \r\nbelieve that if we talk about music creation nowadays, it's very hard to classify \r\nthe \"originality\" of the music because I think all music are \"derivatives\". My point is \r\nsimple, I don't want to reduce my rating to any album of this band due to their music is \r\nderivative or they are a GENESIS clone, or whatever. To me, IQ is one of the most \r\ninspirational bands that I have ever known to-date. Be it their music direction is similar \r\nwith GENESIS or not, I don't really care. I think it's the band choice to be in the vein of \r\nGENESIS. Even, I admire this band in  their ability to create TOUCHY melody in some \r\nmusical segments of their songs. Almost in any song they have written, I find great \r\nmelody (probably in only couple of minutes or even seconds) in particular segments of \r\nsongs they write. The melody really touches your heart. In this melody creation they \r\nare not less creative compared to GENESIS.<p>However, I WILL NOT tolerate any band who intentionally or unintentionally creates a \r\nmusic segment that is \"90%\" similar with other band. I have noticed this happen in \r\nsome prog bands that I will review in other part. For IQ, I never find them doing such \r\nthing.<p>\"Subterranea\" is an album that you MUST HAVE in your prog collection. It's definitely in \r\nthe neo progressive arena where it has a strong melody with keyboard-based music \r\ncomposition in a relatively medium tempo. It's a concept album about a 17-year old boy \r\nthat appeared in city N, 1828. He could not speak but one word. He was buried in the \r\ncellar since he was born. No one knows what was the reason and who set him free.<p>Don't (please don't!) ever try to compare this album with \"The Lamb Lies Down ..\" \r\nbecause it's totally different. I tell you, honestly, all tracks of this album are excellent. \r\nWhile, \"The lamb Lies ..\" has one track, at least, that I hate very much \"The Waiting \r\nRoom\"!! Uuugh .. tell me who's gonna understand this musician's ego? Hey, don't \r\nworry .. I'm a great fan of GENESIS.\r\nJudging this album with \"number of CDs\" only is not wise at all. IMHO.<p>\"Subterranea\" album does not use a tag line melody that is repeatedly used throughout \r\nthe album. Each song has its own melody but the transition between songs were \r\ncreated smoothly. There are some intentional break between songs as well. \"Overture\" \r\nis an instrumental piece that set the atmosphere for the whole album. If you wanna \r\nknow what sort of TOUCHY melody I meant at above, you can find at minutes \"1:36\" of \r\nthis track where Holmes' guitar fills make a melody. It's really touchy! It happens couple \r\nof seconds only but it helps put matters into perspective. Remember, this is a concept \r\nalbum.<p>\"Provider\" is something I call as an overview of the story. It has a great vocal by \r\nNicholls with spacey keyboard sound in the background. \"Are you inside, provider, or \r\nam I?\". This short piece is then followed by a drumming part that opens \"Subterranea\" \r\n(third track). It's a medium tempo and melodic song. Nicholls sings nicely. The keyboard \r\nplayed by Orford is great, combined with simple guitar touch by Holmes. This track is \r\nmuch more enjoyable if you play it loud. \"Powerhouse, sacred vows, trigger happy \r\npunk ..\". The incorporation of saxophone has accentuated the track beautifully. \r\n(Actually, I don't like sax sound. But, for this track .. I love it!).<p>The transition to next track \"Sleepless Incidental\" happens smoothly with a thin acoustic \r\nguitar and keyboard sounds. Nicholls voice dominates the scene at the intro part until a \r\ndazzling drums, bass and organ sounds enter the music. Now the band creates \r\nanother \"touchy\" great melody. This time happens right after Nicholls sings \"I'm only \r\ntaking time. And I'm not where I want to be now\" (minute 3:37) where solo organ by \r\nMartin Orford takes lead with other instruments are quiet. This piece strengthens and \r\naccentuates the song wonderfully. Its nuance is church but its melody is something that \r\nI sometime relate to our country's ethnical song. Cool. I don't believe that mankind can \r\ncreate such a wonderful piece here. This time is longer because it endures altogether \r\nwith lead guitar play until the song ends. Oh God .. this melody makes me cry, really!<p>\"Failsafe\" is another heavy melody track opened by a solo organ right after previous \r\ntrack was finished. The keyboard sound that Orford plays at background is nice \r\nthroughout the song. \"Speak My Name\" is a nice ballad with only vocal and keyboard \r\nsound with acoustic guitar as interlude. This is another track with a great melody. Peter \r\nNichols voice is powerful. He sings with his heart. \"Every time you speak my name .. \r\nyou speak my name..\" . This mellow track is a relaxation before it enters to the \r\nuplifting and dynamic song \"Tunnel Vision\" (one of my favorite tracks). I usually play \r\nthis track outloud to satisfy my listening pleasure. I like when Nichols sings at the \r\nintro \"Don't want to lead a revolution. Let another go ahead .\" Wow! I like the lyrics \r\nand the melody (of course). The musical piece is also excellent. I catch another touchy \r\nmelody again played by guitar fill of Holmes. Really nice. I bet you will love this track! \r\nThe lead guitar interlude is cool.<p>I don't plan to review each track of Disc 1. I just want to conclude the discussion of Disc \r\n1 with my impression that disc 1 is concluded by the band brilliantly with two nice tracks \r\nthat must be enjoyed as one: \"The sense of In Sanity\" (slow track dominated by vocal \r\nand vibraphone sound) and followed by \"State of Mine\" (higher tone track with all \r\ninstruments play together dominated by keyboard sound). I feel so relaxed with the \r\nend track of Disc 1.<p>Disc 2 is opened with a nice piano and howling guitar in \"Laid Low\" (instrumental). \r\nIt \"reminds\" me to GENESIS \"After The Ordeal\" but it is shorter. \"Breathtaker\"'s melody \r\nsounds similar with some part of Disc 1 music in its intro. But when the vocal part \r\nenters, it's totally different nice melody. I enjoy all tracks in Disc 2 with an exception on \r\n5th track \"Unsolid Ground\" which sounds so poppy to me. But, never mind. This album is \r\nexcellent overall. Disc 2 is concluded by an epic track \"The Narrow Margin\" with 20 \r\nminutes duration. This track should be enjoyed by listening to previous track \"High \r\nwaters\" which has strong melody. Again, there is no \"alike\" with \"The Lamb ..\" as \r\nin \"The Lamb\" there is no 20 minute track, my friend. <p>I have no argument for not giving FIVE STAR for this album as this album has a very \r\nstrong songwriting, excellent sonic production of the CD, and great musicianship. All \r\nmusicians do not attempt to demonstrate their skills dominantly, but as  a whole album \r\nthey are able to create an ultimate \"emotional ecstasy\" to their listeners (and especially \r\nto their loyal fans) through their touchy melodies.<p>What do you think? - Gatot Widayanto, Indonesia.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3795#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3795\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3795\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 20, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3795)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=724\"><strong>Alucard</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=724\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/724/cover.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe concept of Concept albums can vary quiet a lot, the Lamb and Tommy being both \r\nquiet strange but some of the individual songs still tell a story in itself. In the Life \r\nversion of Subterrenea Peter Nicholls published a storyline (like Peter Gabriel for the \r\nLamb) which is quiet obscure to me, but even then I don't see the connection between \r\nthe story and the lyrics.They are very abstract TMHO quiet shallow.This can be good \r\nfor 1 or 2 songs but in the whole lyrics there is no decription of whatever might be \r\ngoing on in this story. \r\nFor a record which is mainly sung I find the melodic material quiet poor. It is mostly \r\nathmopheric and I prefer the instrumental parts to the songs.I like a lot the keyboard \r\nwork but the compositions to put it in  value are missing.\r\nAnd why is the  IQ symbol on every page in the booklett? Maybe this is the main Theme \r\nof Subterrenea : IQ introspection.  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3799#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3799\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3799\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, November 2, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3799)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=421\"><strong>Menswear</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=421\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/421/nels&#111;n_happy.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOh the challenge of the infamous double album. It could sink your career in a wink, but \r\nalso when it's properly made with a sense of decency for the listener, woo-hoo and up \r\nwe go. I'm not the one bashing on the hard working pionneers of the double-album \r\nlegacy, au contraire, those are one of my favorite treats.<p>The White Album (Beatles), Tommy (Who), The Wall (Pink Floyd), Mellon Collie and the \r\nInfinite Sadness (Smashing Pumpkins), Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me (The Cure)...all success.<p>IQ is a definte survivor of the very, very ingrate 90's. They managed to pull through \r\nthe 80's quite fairly. Easier than the 90's? Well, the neo scene was on the rise and they \r\nemerged in the right years with the right approach. Although the music wasn't what it is \r\nnow in the 80's. Internet, boys bands, cult of the beauty (male and female) and the big \r\n$$$ factor is now the lot of a band of youngsters since Nirvana. Gotta have a look by \r\nall means. Gotta sell soda pop, clothes and half a million records.  So if you're past your \r\ngolden marketing years  (IQ is for sure), the jump in the Y2K could scare the hell out of \r\nyou. <p>Well the 90's are way behind and IQ gave a try to put all their material in one album at \r\nthat time. George Harisson said: \"What do you do when you have all those songs \r\nfloating around? Gotta put them on paper before they're gone.\" The need to tell a \r\nstory is probably the main attract for IQ to assemble a colossal project as Subterranea. \r\nAnd the whole thing about the allusion about The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is \r\nbullcorn, right? <p>A heavy meal for a newbie, I must admit it tooked me a while to digest all the songs, \r\nand getting my mind to anticipate the melodies. After a long digestion, I realized how \r\nsolid this album is. Tends to get some filling in the end, but Disk 1 is a total, total killer. \r\nNo kidding, some of the best stuff of the 90's. <p>Peter Nicholls' voice sounds like a cross of Neil Tennant (Pet Shop Boys) and Brett \r\nAnderson (Suede). Super groovy basses by John Howitt. This guy's really subtle, but I \r\nwish I could play as fluidly as him! And what a surprise when I realized that Paul Cook \r\nwas the drummer! Is he THE Paul Cook from the SEX PISTOLS??? Oh wow! Man would it be cool if it was the same guy, but it's not. Major disappointment, but hey.<p>Anyway, Nicholls voice and airy keyboards in front, expect lots of melodies to enjoy \r\nand lots of headaches to understand the twisted story. But some will not share the lack \r\nof complexity and the sluggish progression of the plot.On top it sounds so badly from the past. Couldn't they change their approach?!? This record takes it's time to \r\nstart and don't have any surprises. Just good music done professionaly.<p>Close but no cigar.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=36706#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=36706\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=36706\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, June 16, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #36706)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1117\"><strong>Cygnus X-2</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1117\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20061019_175801_Assassing1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nLike I mentioned in my previous review of Spock's Beard's Snow, most groups at one\r\npoint try to create an innovative story and expand over two discs or in the old days\r\ntwo vinyls. While some concepts are easier to digest (for example Spock's Beard's\r\nSnow or The Who's Quadrophenia) others are terribly cryptic and the story is\r\nextremely hard to follow (Pain of Salvation's BE). This album lands more on the\r\ncryptic and dense part than the easy to digest, in my opinion. In fact, it was only\r\nrecently (when I asked an IQ fan) what the story for this album was. Despite the\r\nincredibly dense story line, musically this album has some real shining moments, but\r\nlike most concept albums is wrought with the problem of overuse of ideas. Nicholls is\r\nthe dominating factor on this album with the vocals being more of a lead instrument\r\nthan ever. But that doesn't mean that the rest of the group is just backing, the\r\nmusicians in the group worked as hard as ever creating music to give a backdrop to\r\nthe certain atmosphere of each piece, be it the ambient Provider, or the rocking and\r\nsomewhat heavy epic of The Narrow Margin. I guess in the end it all comes down to\r\nopinion.<p><em>At this point I think it'd be best if I tell you the story from the source I've\r\nheard (forum member Richardh), \"Secret Underground Lab. People are kept there from\r\nbirth for observation/experimental purposes. Then they escape. Our protagonist lives\r\non the top ..finds love along the way ...then all the escapees get captured and are\r\nall burnt to death trying to get away (The Narrow Margin) apart from our protagonist\r\nwho decides he doesn't like the world above and volunteers to go back down..but he is\r\nthe only one left. End.\".</em><p>The album is about 100 minutes long and split essentially evenly onto two discs, with\r\nthe first having the bulk of the album. Opening with the instrumental piece Overture\r\n(like most conceptual pieces do anyway) from the get go one can see a more concise\r\nand to the point IQ musically. The hardest thing to digest about this story is the\r\nvocals, which in my opinion require looking into heavily if you even want to find a\r\ntrace of the storyline in them. Pieces like Subterranea and Failsafe could be stand\r\nalone pieces, though, they have that edge over the rest of the pieces, which seem\r\nlike a more cohesive whole. You can also hear a budding experimentation in the group\r\nin The Sense in Sanity, which utilizes what I believe to be marimba for the entire\r\npiece (which plays a solid 7/4 motif). Musically. the guys \r\nhaven't changed their sound drastically, they still bow down to the same cliche that\r\nthey have been for their entire career, but they've always been able to make it work\r\nand it is no different here.<p>The second disc could have used a bit of self editing and the album would have made a\r\nfantastic single album, by the way. Laid Low is essentially an instrumental that\r\ncould have been cut out because all it is is a repitition of the same theme from\r\nState of Mine (the song that ended the first disc). Still, though, there are a few\r\ntracks that are really quite good and I couldn't imagine the album without them.\r\nSomewhere in Time has a fantastic main melody and Nicholls' vocals are quite soothing\r\nat times. Mike Holmes is also fantastic on this track performing in his style that\r\nhas become quickly identifiable these days (for me at least). The Narrow Margin is\r\nthe final, and longest piece on the album running at exactly 20 minutes. And like\r\nmost IQ epics it runs at a formula, but any trace of said formula can be only found\r\nin minute places. I actually couldn't imagine a more fitting ending to the album, as\r\nit runs the mill of emotions and ends essentially with what began the album (the\r\nProvider theme is repeated again with the same lyrics).<p>So I guess in the end it all comes down to if you can take long concept pieces where\r\nmost of the time you'll be unaware of a concept unless you really look into it.\r\nMusically, I love this album as it is short and to the point, but they're not afraid\r\nto let loose and really get something going at the same time. If you're expecting an\r\nalbum like The Wake or Ever you'll come up a bit short, but for those who really want\r\na rollercoaster ride of emotions, then this album may be the one for you. Me? I'm in\r\nthe middle, as I find a lot of this album to be interesting, but a few fatal flaws\r\nmar it from being anywhere near a masterpiece (this is all my opinion, though). 3.5/5.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=86338#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=86338\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=86338\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, August 9, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #86338)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1820\"><strong>NJprogfan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's most famous album up to that point in their career, it marked a try at the old prog \r\nconcept chestnut: a loner/oddball out in the world. Musically, it's a strong album with IQ's \r\ntrademark gothic prog showing up in spots, ('Tunnel Vision', 'The Sense Of Sanity') with a \r\nfew absolute stunners, ('Failsafe' with Holme's unmistakable and unforgetable guitar \r\nmelody and the massive track 'The Narrow Margin'). Not that there isn't other fine tracks. \r\nThe title track uses a rarely played sax in an IQ song, and the instrumentals 'State Of Mind' \r\nand 'Laid Low' will give you goosebumps. It's the few unremarkable songs that tip the \r\nbalance away from classic status. 'Capricorn' is too much like Pendragon's boring Pink \r\nFloydish prog and 'Unsolid Ground' is too straight-forward rock. Tracks like 'Somewhere In \r\nTime' have classic Nichol's lyrics sung with his unique and excellent voice. It's when 'The \r\nNarrow Margin' hits that you sit up and take notice of the power and imagination of this \r\nband. Twenty minutes long, it's a tad too long but makes up with some tasty Hackett-like \r\nguitar in the 6 minute mark, then at the nine minute mark...BAM! classic IQ with Cook's \r\ndrumwork shining. From here on out it's a tour-de-force for the band with every player in \r\nfull command and playing superior melodies. I've played this album many times and what I \r\ncome away with is the different sounds they try. They progressed like all good bands do. \r\nAlthough there's a few stumbles on both discs, it's a stunning album and is a must for all IQ \r\nfans. For those not familiar with the band, it could actually be a good starting point. Not a \r\n5-star album, but boy they tried their darnest.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88241#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=88241\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=88241\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, August 26, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #88241)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10301\"><strong>evenless</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> IQ - Subterranea </strong><p>Very fine album in the same style as IQ's 1993 album <strong> \"Ever\" </strong>, but this time IQ \r\nmanaged to deliver a genuine 2 disc concept album!<p>IQ's <strong> \"Subterannea\" </strong> probably is one of my favourite concept albums of all time \r\ntogether with <strong> MARILLION's \"Brave\" </strong> and the very recent <strong> \"Posthumous \r\nSilence\" </strong> by the German neo-progressive rock band <strong> \"SYLVAN\". </strong>  I do not \r\nonly think those three bands all delivered a fine concept album, but I also think those \r\nthree bands are the three finest bands in the neo-progressive genre.  <p>I discovered IQ by their brilliant last album <strong> \"Dark Matter\" </strong> and worked my way \r\nback through their catalogue from there on, so <strong> \"Subterannea\" </strong> was my \r\nsecond introduction to IQ and what an introduction it was!<p>For me the big difference between those two album was that I liked <strong> \"Dark Matter\" \r\n<strong> already at first listen and I noticed that </strong> \"Subterannea\" </strong> took some more \r\ntime to \"settle in\".

I have listening to it hundred of times since its initial release, have seen it once \r\nperformed by Genesis (you know, when they were five) and saw no less than four \r\nrepresentations by \"The Musical Box\" which brought me back to the magics of the \r\noriginal show.<p>I believe that \"The Who\"  were the only ones fully successful to create a double \r\nconcept album with \"Tommy\". <p>So, what can we expect from \"Subterranea\" ? <p>In a way I fully agree with Gatot that this work should in factnot be compared with \"The \r\nLamb\" but there are still some similarities that I will outline when then occur.<p>I have to say, that this work is pretty nice to listen to : very few weak numbers, but \r\nvery little jewels as well. The album flows nicely and with no surprise till the title track \r\nwhich is one of my fave (and one of the few regularly on their live setlist from this \r\nalbum). <p>\"Failsafe\" might well be the first number having something to do with \"The Lamb\". Here \r\nand there some similarities in the keys with \"Slippermen\" but not too much, as well as \r\nsome piano/vocals reminding the intro of \"The Lamb\" (the title track) but short as well. \r\nNothing to do with \"The Lamb\" but towards the end (twice), the riff from \"Watcher\" is \r\ninstantly recognizable as well. A good number after all which will also do a longer career \r\nin their live sets.<p>The emotional and sad tone of Peter (Nicholls) is wonderfully highlighted in \"Speak My \r\nName\". A soft and gentle acoustic number full of melancholy (he's a melancholy \r\nman...). To compensate, we'll get some heavier attack with \"Tunnel Vision\". But this \r\nmood will be reverted to a short and welcome spacey section, full of lighness and \r\ninspiration. One of the first solo from Holmes as well (but there won't be many). \r\nAnother highlight.<p>\"Watcher Of The Skies\" (what a great song !) is back again in the intro of \"Infernal \r\nChorus\". This song has been re-used countless times  by lots of bands but since it is \r\none of my preferred track, I can not refrain from liking most of its derivates as well. The \r\nlast trio of songs from disc one are a bit weaker, especially \"King Of Fools\". \"State of \r\nMind\" being again a short but fully Genesis inspired number.<p>All in all, disc one is rather good but not grandiose.<p>Disc two holds some \"transitional\" tracks. \"Laid Low\" and \"The Other Side\" (but they are \r\nvery short ones). <p>\"Breathtaker\" is a harder and less inspired song, as \"Capricorn\" but on the softer edge. \r\nWith \"Unsolid Ground\" IQ is back in business but still does not reach the quality of disc \r\none. The first track to do so is \"Somewhere in Time\", more complex than the five \r\nprevious ones. Variations, good vocals and strong backing band. This is a pure \r\ntraditional IQ song. Very pleasant, aerial at times while \"High Waters\" features a great \r\nsecond half and instrumental part (but it only last for a mere minute).<p>So, the hopes now rely on IQ's second epic song (after \"The Last Human Gateway\" on \r\ntheir debut album). \"The Narrow Margin\" will fortunately holds its promises. Emotional \r\nlyrics, brilliant vocal interpretation, very good guitar play. The whole band seems to be \r\nvery much inspired. Due to its lenght (over twenty minutes) IQ will deliver some \r\ninstrumental passages as well. I must say that in this ocean of lyrics, they are very \r\nwelcome even if, at times, Genesis's fanthom is coming out (again \"Watcher\").<p>Disc two only works for two/three tracks. <p>Bearing in mind that both CD's only hold just over 100 minutes of music, IQ would have \r\nbetter been inspired to release a full lenght CD (you know like TFK, with 78 minutes of \r\nmusic). This choice was possible with the digital technology (not with the vinyl one). \r\nThey would have released a better album, I think. I have read the story \r\nof \"Subtarranea\" and honestly it does not really stunned me.

At a certain point in time he is released by \r\nhis capturer and emerges in our society where he experiences things...for the first time(\"Subterranea\"). After some hard times \r\namong the homeless (\"Sleeping Incedental\") he is taken in by a religious cult but refuses to be converted by them (\"Failsafe\"). He \r\nmeets a girl...who gives him a name. He has a deep friendship / romance with this person(\"Speak My Name\") but in the end she is \r\ntaken away from him (\"Tunnel Vision\"). Then he notices he is being followed by henchmen from the man who had held him prisoner for \r\nall those years. He captures one of them and forces him to reveal the name of the man responsible for his misery (Mockenrue) and \r\nthen kills his follower (\"Infernal Chorus\")...\"State Of Mind\" is supposed to represent the protagonist on the run, and during the \r\nsecond disc he tries to find this Mockenrue and take revenge. Along the way he realises that life on the outside world is much harder \r\nthan his earlier, controlled life (\"Unsolid Ground\"). At a certain point he takes on a disguise to be able to find out what's happening\r\n(\"Capricorn\") then he notices that he's not the only one with this experience, he sees other people who show the same marks / symbol \r\nhe's been tagged with-seemingly there are more subjects for Mockenrue's experiment(\"Somewhere In Time\"). The mark is the IQ logo \r\nwhich can be found in various places in the cd booklet. Mockenrue's victims decide to team up and take revenge (\"High Waters\").The \r\ngroup ends up in a large building to which Mockenrue sets fire (\"The Narrow Margin\"). In the end the protagonist manages to get out \r\nof there alive (the only one) and realises he is a menace to himself and society and decides to go back into his confinement.\" <p>\r\nMy favourite song on the first disc is \"Sleepless Incedental\" that opens with strummed guitar that recalls PORCUPINE TREE as vocals \r\ncome in.This is a moving song with some heaviness and a more aggressive sound after 2 minutes.The last 2 minutes are pure \r\ninstrumental bliss. \"Subterranea\" is also a terrific song that is uptempo and catchy. The sax 5 minutes in sounds great. \"Failsafe\" is \r\nanother highlight from disc one. On disc two my favourite song is \"Somewhere In Time\". I like the contrast of the ballad like intro with \r\ngentle vocals and a pastoral soundscape with the almost metal sound 3 1/2 minutes in. \"Capricorn\" opens with guitar melodies that \r\nsound like \"Kayleigh\" from MARILLION. Some good soaring guitar later followed by a sax solo.The song ends with the sound of the \r\nwind blowing that continues into the next song \"The Other Side\" that is so different from all the other songs. It's very atmospheric \r\nwith synths, flute and gentle guitar. Not as good as IONA does it though. \"The Narrow Margin\" is a twenty minute song with plenty of \r\ntempo and mood shifts. It's a real ride !<p>\r\nUp to this point in time this is their best work. The production is perfect and I have to mention the excellent drumming as well. Ok they \r\nall shine on this ambitious endeavour.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=128007#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=128007\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=128007\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, July 10, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #128007)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15928\"><strong>progrules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15928\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15928/cover_1325619920091.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI recently did my review of Dark Matter and tried to explain why I didn't like that album compared to Ever. I don't think I explained very well but now that I'm reviewing this superb double album by this British neo band I think it all falls on its place.<p>Because it's actually all about getting it and grasping it. And of course a certain album must get to you in a way. There has to be a connection between you and the artists composing and performing it. And then still it's a mysterious thing how exactly that works. I guess we will never know. It just happens (or in case of no connection, it doesn't). But then still it's strange that one and the same band can leave you totally cold with one release (Dark Matter) and that same band totally gets you in a spell with another release.<p>Right now I'm listening to this doubler one last time, I haven't heard it for over a year by now and maybe that's a little part of the secret, I knew I loved it in the past and then it's always interesting if after some time the miracle still is on. Well, I can tell you, it is !<p>What a fantastic concept album this is. Especially with disc one the 4th and 5th track (Sleepless Incidental and Failsafe) I cannot tell how good it is. It's simply fantastic, I have no doubt this is IQ's best and always will be. The two mentioned tracks are two of the best on the doubler (along with TunnelVision as well), I have to admit that but on the other disc we also have the great epic The Narrow Margin. But all the other tracks fall behind in quality with these.<p>And that's also the reason I can't call this a masterpiece but it's a lot better than two other good albums by IQ, Ever and Seventh House. It's their best and it gets 4 stars but actually it's even worth a bit more (4,2).</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=160720#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=160720\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=160720\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, February 4, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #160720)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's 'Subterranea' must really have been a revelation back in '97. Such a relief, a full sci-fi rock neo prog concept album without a weak moment, with many highlights, a strong 'epic' and a relatively good production. Furthermore it really makes sense as a concept album; I really get the feeling I'm going on a journey when I listen to it. Listening to it now, in 2020 (after the release of Resistance), the album has almost become a nostalgic piece of prog of before that big progressive wave that would hit in the new century. <p>On 'Subterranea' the song-writing (both the sung parts and the instrumental parts) is among the most cohesive and expressive of the genre. The songs are often dark, fearful and the sense of being lost in this sci-fi universe fits well with the modern synths of Martin Orford and glassy and melodic (though slightly thin recorded) electric guitars of Mike Holmes. The album also has its share of emotional ballad-type song, of which 'Capricorn' is particularly grasping. Peter Nicholls started his career with IQ imitating Peter Gabriel, but eventually found is own unique voice. Nicholls is perfectly suited to sing a bit like an actor; creating the story with his tone of voice and bringing the lyrics in a lively immersed way. The new listeners will have to pierce through a think layer of neo-prog abstractness (first the music sounds ' way out there') before they'll reach the type of depth this musical experience has to offer. Of course this album is highly indebted to Genesis' 'The Lamb Dies Down on Broadway', but I would argue that IQ did more than any other band to further that type of progrock that Genesis left behind in the late seventies.  <p>This is an album I hold dear and I would be hard pressed to name a '90 prog release (in any sub-genre) that is significantly better. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=178190#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=178190\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=178190\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 25, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #178190)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=14399\"><strong>Hercules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=14399\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/14399/Wrapped_up_parrot_Hercules.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIn the year or so since I joined this site, I have found a few great bands, some mediocre ones and\r\nsome truly awful ones. But none of the great bands I have discovered comes near IQ. I bought their\r\nentire catalogue; having heard many of the tracks on you tube, I wanted to see how this album works\r\nas a concept album. After 20 or so listens, I feel I can now come to a conclusion.<p>It works brilliantly. Nearly all the tracks are of a very high standard and the idea links them\r\nwell. This band are superlative musicians, have a control of melody which beats almost all the great\r\nbands of the 70s (Camel and Genesis excepted) and the lyrics are intelligent and thoughtful. They\r\nbring back memories of the golden era wtihout being like any of the bands from that time, influenced\r\nby what went before but not mere imitations.<p>I have heard many who rant about neo-prog bands and how unoriginal they are (the first review I saw\r\nwhen I scrolled down I saw was an example and made my blood boil) but that is missing the point. At\r\nthe end of the 70s most of the bands either called it a day or sold out, went commercial and\r\nabandoned prog. IQ, along with Marillion and Pendragon (to name a few bands) picked up the prog\r\nbaton and ran with it, evolving and changing the direction of prog. The result is magnificent albums\r\nlike this one.<p>The album needs to be listened to in its entirety. Most tracks are fairly straightforward except the\r\nepic and majestic The Narrow Margin, but Tunnel Vision and Sleepless Incidental are highlights.\r\nMartin Orford sprinkles his magical keyboards everywhere and Peter Nicholls produces the best vocal\r\nperformance of his life. Mike Holmes is a grossly underrated guitarist, capable of beautiful solos\r\nand solid fills, whilst the rhythm section is a powerhouse, especially John Jowett's driving bass.<p>Comparisons will inevitably be made with The Lamb but they are pretty irrelevant - Subterranea is\r\nmore consistent and (heresy!) I think better overall, simply because the story is more engaging (I\r\nnever identified with Rael or the American cultural slant) and there are fewer bad tracks.<p>To conclude, this is an absolutely essential album and a rare masterpiece from the 90s.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=186896#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=186896\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=186896\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 25, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #186896)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1818\"><strong>Matti</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1818\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1818/bruegel-snow.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nHere's the 100th rating for this album. No less than four stars! I first heard this in 2000, around\r\nthe time when I was very willing to find some new prog bands but was disillusioned time after time\r\nby the stuff that the library databases categorized as prog. Most of it was simply too close to\r\nheavy for my taste. IQ was musically something that immediately responded to my idea of how a Neo\r\nProg band should sound like. Clarity of sounds (keyboards dominating but far from OVER-dominating),\r\nmelodic rollercoaster rides, compositions that are suitably catchy without cheesiness, and most of\r\nall, music clearly identified as PROG, descending from Yes, Genesis, Camel, ELP... And remembering\r\nthat my path into Prog went via MARILLION and backwards from them, it's easy to see why IQ caught my\r\ninterest. In a sense IQ seemed to modernize the same classic Prog vocabulary as Fish-era Marillion\r\nhad done; if GENESIS had steered into more ambitious (Neo) Prog in the 80's instead of pop\r\ndominance, they might have produced music reminiscent of IQ's.<p>Well, there was a negative side to my delight. It took a while before Peter Nicholls' somewhat nasal\r\nvoice stopped annoying me. With PENDRAGON it was the same, but slightly different: I got more and\r\nmore annoyed by Nick Barrett's singing STYLE, whereas Nicholls uses his own voice pretty well after\r\nall, and IQ wouldn't be IQ without his voice. It somehow suits to the overall sound.<p>There aren't any disastrous tracks here, though some I dislike a bit, only a small minority really.\r\nA bunch of instrumentals is the cherry on the top. From the prog's point of view the 20-minute\r\ncloser Narrow Margin is a highlight without a doubt, but a good deal of the rest is just as fine,\r\nonly with shorter running times. One of my personal favourites is the calm and mystic Sense In\r\nSanity, followed seamlessly by a Banks-like instrumental burst State Of Mine. The total length of\r\nthis 2-CD album is no more than 102 minutes, but I'm not going to say They Should Have Made It Into\r\nOne Terrific Disc. In fact I would rather say so about the Tales Of The Topograpgic Oceans by YES,\r\nwhich does suffer from the so called dinosaur disease. Subterranea is a completely healthy baby, and\r\none of the most recommendable albums of Neo Prog scene.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=216438#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=216438\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=216438\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 18, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #216438)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15596\"><strong>stefro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15596\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15596/STEF.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe group's most ambitious work to date is, unfortunately, also the one which see's IQ eschew their\r\ncomplex, Genesis-inspired neo-prog sound in favour of a more straight-forward 'rock' approach.\r\n'Subterranea' features over 100 minutes of music spread over two discs, yet there are only a handful\r\nof stand-out tracks, such as the 'The Wake'-lit title track and the energetic 'Tunnel Vision'. The\r\noverall sound is light and airy, with the group's musical nucleus of keyboardist Martin Orford and\r\nguitarist Mike Holmes seemingly particularly un-inspired.\r\nSome have written that 'Subterranea' is the apex of IQ's career, but just because the album is long\r\nand features a complex story does not automatically mean it can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the\r\nother great concept abums sch as Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' or Thick As A Brick' by Jethro Tull.\r\n'Subterranea' pales in comparison to IQ's classic albums, the superb 1983 debut 'Tales From The Lush\r\nAttic' and it's seminal follow-up of two years later 'The Wake', and it's a real shame because it\r\nseems that the group have thrown everything including the kitchen sink into making this mammoth,\r\ndouble-disc release a reality.\r\nOverlong, dull and instrumentally rather bland, 'Subterranea' is a rare dip in form for this\r\notherwise excellent and iconic neo-prog band. Every group has their weaker moments(just ask Genesis\r\nabout 'And Then There Were Three' or query Yes about their awful '90125' comeback 'pop' album), and,\r\nsadly, IQ's has come when they seemed to be trying hardest.

So why only two stars? Well, my rating needs to be seen in the wider context of IQ's discography. This album came out just after the excellent Ever, and just before the very good The Seventh House. Subterranea is, to my mind, a lesser album. And as such, even if I find it rather enjoyable, I just cannot give it the same rating that I gave to The Seventh House (and that album, in turn, though stronger, is not deserving of the same high rating as Ever and Dark Matter). The two primary reasons I like Subterranea less than most other IQ albums is that the songs are not as strong and memorable, and that it is too long for its own good. Maybe, if it was condensed into a single disc with only the best material, it could perhaps have reached the same level of quality as The Seventh House, but even so it could never have matched IQ's best albums. <p>The conceptual nature of the album is not sufficient to retain the listener's full attention from start to end. At some point, I feel that it is just more of the same and it becomes a bit monotonous. Still, there is good stuff to be found here. If you are an IQ fan, and you don't have this album, by all means get it. You will almost certainly like it (as I do). But if you are new to IQ, this is definitely the wrong place to start, in my opinion. Any other post-Ever IQ album gives a better introduction to the band.  <p>Recommended for fans and collectors, but not among the best IQ albums\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=304987#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=304987\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=304987\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, October 17, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #304987)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Contemporary prog at its finest</strong><p>It took IQ some four years to release a follow up album to the fine \"Ever\" from 1993. The \r\nunchanged line up were not however sitting on their hands, \"Subterranea\" proving to be the \r\nband's first double (CD) concept album. Admirably, they came up with a suitably grandiose \r\ntheme for the album, the story centring on a man who is the victim of a tortuous experiment. \r\nThe man is initially subjected to prolonged captivity in isolation, then allowed out into the \r\nreal world. The tale then takes us through his experiences as he tries to cope with an \r\naccelerated life of discovery. Needless to say, adverse and sinister forces are at work \r\nexacerbating the challenge. <p>If we wish to be cynical, we can spend time looking for precedents for such a tale. For me \r\nthough the time is better spent accepting that such concepts are one of the facets which \r\ndistinguishes prog. The only question to be answered is <em>how good is the album?</em>! \r\nSuch a question is particularity valid when it comes to this sort of presentation, as the \r\nconcept can sometimes overwhelm the project to the detriment of the music. <p>The album opens impressively with a symphonic \"Overture\" which blends orchestral \r\nsounds with pounding rhythms and anthemic tones. In the best traditions of such albums, \r\nthe tracks are generally kept short (although the final track runs to some 20 minutes) being \r\nlinked together to form a continuous piece. <p>The musical style of IQ lends itself well to this format, the highly melodic roots of each song \r\nbeing fully exploited as each piece is brought to fruition. While the album is undoubtedly \r\nbest heard as a complete project, the majority of the individual tracks stand up well as \r\nisolated numbers in their own right. Tracks such as the title piece would have fitted in \r\nperfectly on any of the band's albums, the guest sax on this particular track offering an \r\nimpressive additional dimension.  <p>To single out tracks though is to pay a disservice both to the complete piece, and to those \r\nnot mentioned. I could focus on the magnificence of \"Capricorn\" with its superb sax and \r\nguitar, or the majestic 9 minutes which is \"Failsafe\", or of course the epic finale. I say again \r\nthough, while each track stands proud in its own right, this is an album to be heard as a \r\ncomplete entity.<p>The prog genre (in name at least) has been pulled this way and that in recent times. Many \r\nbands and fans of those bands have discovered that it is now trendy to be labelled as prog, \r\nand attempt to jump on the bandwagon. It is though to bands such as IQ that we have to \r\nlook for the spirit of prog being carried forward towards and into the 21st century. This is an \r\nalbum of contemporary prog at its absolute finest. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=545612#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=545612\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=545612\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 8, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #545612)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSubterranea is an album which has grown on me over time. At first, I'd have given it a four star \r\nrating on the basis of the individual songs, but the more I listen to it the more I think the whole \r\nexperience is greater than the sum of its parts. Whereas Ever refreshed and renewed the \r\nsound of The Wake, Subterranea brings the IQ sound all the way up to date; much like \r\nMarillion's run of masterpieces from Brave to This Strange Engine, the album finds the band \r\nexpanding the boundaries of their sound.<p>Despite the double-disc concept album format and the inclusion of a 20 minute finale in the \r\nform of The Narrow Margin, there's something conspicuously absent from Subterranea, and \r\nthat's the band attempting to sounding progger-than-prog as other bands might be inclined to \r\nattempt on a piece such as this. Where a proggy touch would be beneficial - as on epics like \r\nThe Narrow Margin - they go for it, where an approach drawing from other contemporary music \r\ngenres would work better, they plump for that instead. (One of my favourite examples of the \r\nlatter is the gorgeous Capricorn, a mellow rock number with an achingly beautiful sax solo.)<p>All this good stuff is combined with a genuinely interesting and novel plot for a concept album, \r\nupdating the legend of Kasper Hauser for the X-Files generation, and whilst each individual \r\nsong might not be a prog masterpiece, they're never less than compelling listening, and taken \r\ntogether the emotional arc the album tracks proves irresistible. I don't listen to it as often as \r\nEver or The Wake, but that's mainly because I need to set aside more time to listen to the thing \r\nall the way through than for those two; of late, I've come to believe it's just as good as them.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=630084#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=630084\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=630084\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, February 11, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #630084)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>IQ's \"Subterranea\" is a double concept album that is the band at their most ambitious.</strong><p>Following up the \"Ever\" masterpiece is no mean feat so everything is upsized to a whopping running \r\ntime of 103 minutes. The album boasts some of IQ's longest songs such as the 20 minute 'The Narrow \r\nMargin' to close the album off in style, and also has very short tracks edging towards 2 minutes, such \r\nas 'Provider' 'State of Mine' and 'Laid Low'. It is an odd album for IQ who are tackling a massive project \r\nhere with 2 CDs of non stop prog at the end of the 90s (1997) but it is certainly full of some amazing \r\nmusicianship and compositions. Peter Nicholl's vocals are always crystalline and easy on the ears, and \r\nhe is joined by legends of IQ, Martin Orford on keyboards, and flute, Mike Holmes on guitars, John \r\nJowitt on bass, and Paul Cook on drums. This is the class act \r\nthat brought us \"Ever\" and earlier \"The Wake\" (though Tim Essau was the bassist on this album). It is \r\nnot surprising that the album came out with a great deal of enthusiasm by the prog community but I \r\nhave noticed that in the eyes of many the album failed to deliver, falling just short of a masterpiece, and \r\nin fact many were disappointed. <p>\r\nPerhaps more is less in this case and this album suffers the overblown excessive disease of \"Tales \r\nFrom Topographic Oceans\"-itis. The symptoms of the disease are excessive cryptic conceptual material \r\nand songs that are forgettable and get lost in their own overblown structures. This is a real journey and \r\none needs to really put aside a great deal of time to indulge in it and perhaps be in the right frame of \r\nmind. It is certainly not an album that will appeal to all but nevertheless is still replete with incredible \r\nmoments of beauty and amazing musicianship. The concept is hard to grasp but concerns an Secret \r\nUnderground Lab where scientific experiments are conducted, and the people try to escape to the \r\nsurface, and get incinerated in the process. One lone man who lives above decides, after a failed \r\nrelationship, that the world he lives in is far worse and ventures into the underground, but ultimately finds \r\nhe is the only one there and so is trapped, alienated and alone.<p>\r\nThe album is certainly more bombastic than previous material beginning with majesty and pomp with \r\n'Overture'. The clean voice of Nicholl's is heard on 'Provider', followed by the first great moment, \r\n'Subterranea', with futuristic synth rhythms and a heavier guitar phrase on a rollicking beat.  The \r\nbassline is one of the best from IQ, and I love the upbeat feeling on this. The lyrics are fascinating; \r\n\"Cadillac, heart attack, back of this beyond, push a king, TV queen, accommodating blonde, a traitors \r\ngaze while you wait.\" The slowed synth interlude brings it to an ambience, before it returns to the \r\ncynical lyrics and melodies, \"can I hold on, can I belong to all the things you are, there's no sane in, \r\nchaos reigns in subterranea.\" The sax at the end is a sheer delight and this track is a definitive highlight.\r\n \r\n \r\n'Sleepless Incidental' follows seamlessly with calming vocals, and some great guitar phrases. The \r\nkeyboard solo at the end is Orford at his best and it is augmented by soaring lead guitars. 'Failsafe' is a \r\n9 minute track with some nice musicianship and then it bogs down with a lacklustre ballad in 'Speak \r\nMy Name', that lulls me off to dreamland.  <p>\r\n'Tunnel Vision wakes me again with the great heavy guitar riff, and more forceful vocals. I like the \r\nmelodies on this and angular time sigs, leading to glorious guitar soling, with squeals and sustained \r\nstring bends. The bass pulsates nicely and it culminates in a refreshing synth motif. 'Infernal Chorus' \r\nseamlessly follows and builds a strong marching percussion and guitar over synth layers. The sig shifts \r\nto accommodate a chugging riff before Nicholl's vocals return; \"avoiding confrontation in this infernal \r\nchorus, who watches he who watches, no one above suspicion.\" The song has a magical synth melody \r\nthat reminds me of Ultravox for a moment. The song stops for a pause and then launches into some \r\nkiller keyboards, simply stunning work from Orford. The lyrics are surprisingly dark at this point; \"I am \r\nyour murdering angel of death, silently you will provide what I need, give me a focus give me a name, \r\nback to your maker and turn to his side, unresurrected and unrecognised.\" A decent track with some \r\nshining musicianship. It ends with a chilling effect like chains dragging and an alien wail. The album is \r\ngetting into darker territory and we are soon getting conceptually deeper with 'King Of Fools'. The \r\npulsing synth is effective along with rhythmic vocals and ominous key pads. It blends with a heartbeat \r\ninto 'The Sense In Sanity', tinged with an intro of Oriental chimes that maintain a polyphonic rhythm and \r\nsynths wash over. Nicholl's melancholy tones are distinct; \"Ignited by the realising eyes, unwrapped \r\naround the solitary sound, a failing voice, collapsing on the unfamiliar ground, an empty heart am I the \r\nonly one.\" The minimalism of a voice and synth works well to break away from the busier soundscape. It \r\nmerges into 'State Of Mine', with a distorted guitar riff that fades up and louder synth phrases. The \r\ninstrumental ends the first CD on a pleasant uplifting note. <p>\r\nCD 2 begins with a brief piano introduction on 'Laid Low', with a spacey lead guitar, and then \r\n'Breathtaker' that clocks just over 6 minutes, comes in with more aggressive vocals; \"beyond \r\nimagination, born of blood and fire, in splendid isolation, I have lived corrupted and inspiring, no longer \r\ngod's Appolo, no more Mercury, down among the unbelievers,\" and then an expletive follows and \r\nsurprised me as it is unlike IQ. This is a raw approach and perhaps as heavy as the band gets at this \r\nstage in their career. A tirade of keyboards follows and some thunder accompanies Nicholls next verse. \r\nAt the end of the song the rain pours down in a stormcloud and the acoustic intro of 'Capricorn' shines \r\nthrough. The lyrics are heard \"The night holds a multitude of uncovered sins\", and then a wonderful \r\nsaxophone sound lights up the dark. The music reminds me of Marillion here, and as always the guitars \r\nsoar to the stratosphere. <p>\r\nThe icy winds and distant sax prepare us for the Oriental flavours of 'The Other Side', a brief musical \r\ntransition of acoustic chimes and bamboo flute. It is a river of dreamy and beautiful ambience, and \r\nsegues to 'Unsolid Ground'. This track has a steady guitar riff and relaxing vocals, and builds to a \r\nstronger beat. It sounds more commercial and straight forward, but I like the lead break and electronic \r\nsequenced synths. The album at this stage is bogging down a bit and I needed something more \r\ncomplex and impressive. \r\n  <p>'Somewhere In Time' answers my wishes with acoustic vibrations in the intro. The vocals are heartfelt; \r\n\"on and on want to feel somehow, somewhere in time, you'll see it all the way, what I do now, gives into \r\nimpulse, reaches in between, gets back a notion, still remembers a dream.\" The flute work here is really \r\nnice and has an Irish feel, and then a sequenced synth fades up turning everything to a futuristic style. \r\nLead guitars blaze through the fog of synths and the beat is transformed to more uptempo. A cool riff \r\nlocks in for a moment and there is a delightful bassline from Jowitt. The guitar riffs are excellent on this \r\ntrack and come and go until the great synth solo at the end. This is followed by 'High Waters', another \r\npiano ballad and it leads inevitably to the massive epic of the album.  <p>\r\n'The Narrow Margin' is a 20 minute monster that I was hoping would be as good as other epics I have \r\nheard over the years. It begins with an odd percussion and pretty piano runs, and then vocals are heard; \r\n\"divided by loyalty, surrounded by emotion, nobody under here remembers any mercy at all, we stay \r\ndown, deciding the borderline, did no one tell you, I couldn't have made you mine, because I feel your \r\npain more than my own.\" I have no idea what the concept is about but is sounds spiritually linked, \r\nperhaps a journey into darkness of subterranean levels of consciousness, and then escaping by a \r\nnarrow margin. It doesn't really matter, but the music still manages to transfix even at the end despite \r\nsome lulls in between. At 5:30 a gorgeous lead guitar sound is heard and then a bass heavy beat \r\nbegins. The song is about to divert into a new feel, and the next verse is even more melancholy; \"try to \r\nsleep, I will come but I'm still waiting for you, and wherever you are, I'm still inside you now.\" Nicholls's \r\nsings of unrequited love and not being able to hide from his true feelings. He sings, \"I could never go \r\nback\", and a heavier riff crunches in, a more metal approach and it is enhanced with an amazing lead \r\nguitar solo. This is a wonderful moment on the epic, and I love the angular riffs, leading to a staccato \r\nrhythm accentuated by fast piano runs. The lyrics focus on darker themes; \"voices circulating around \r\nthe musty hall, and the kerosene is ignited, incandescent in the crossfire, do my eyes betray the \r\nlongest night of all.\" An explosion is heard breaking the rhythm and an ethereal atmosphere takes over \r\nat 12 minutes, quite disturbing after all the upbeat music. A new fast and fragmented riff fades up and is \r\nfollowed by bright keyboard soloing. The band are off and running here and at their best. The lengthy \r\ninstrumental section is powerful and enthusiastically executed. It runs out of steam at the end but \r\nnevertheless it is nice to hear such an ambitious lengthy track at the end of the 90s era.     <p>\r\nIt was quite an expedition, a lengthy voyage into the world of IQ, but at the end there is enough here to \r\nwarrant high praise. It is not a masterpiece, due to some lulls in the excitement, but overall there are \r\nsome wonderful shining moments on \"Subtrerranea\". It suffers from prog excess but if you give it time \r\nthe melodies will impress and the musicianship is nothing short of excellent throughout. I prefer \"Ever\" \r\nand \"Frequency\" where the 1 CD is packed with non-stop brilliance, whereas this 2 CD album does not \r\nmaintain a consistent quality with a few songs that may have been best left off. However, there is no \r\ndenying that the band went for the concept album hammer and tongs, and the result is a wondrous \r\njourney into Neo prog territory.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=794993#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=794993\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=794993\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, July 26, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #794993)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12654\"><strong>apps79</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12654\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12654/Hals_Jester_with_a_Lute.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFrom the end 94' and on, while IQ were hitting the road promoting the ''Ever'' album, they begun playing snippets and early forms of tracks from what was to become their most ambitious work.As the recordings of their new album were coming to reality, IQ even refused to play live, focusing on this grandiose effort.After a couple of cancelled release dates, finally ''Subterranea'', a 2-CD and over 100 minutes concept album, sees the light at the end of 1997 on Giant Electric Pea.<p>For many this album is the reincarnation of ''The lamb lies on Broadway'', both because it is a long theatrical and inventive fantasy story and because IQ were always a heavily GENESIS-influenced group.The story is built around a man, isolated from reality, part of a weird experiment, who is eventually let loose by the men they imprisoned him and begins a long trip for searching the reasons he was kept locked.His story passes many different stages, meeting plenty of characters, in a dramatic attempt to find the truth about his existence.<p>Practically IQ did not abandon the style of music they made them one of the most beloved Progressive Rock bands worldwide.This time though it is extremely highly recommended to follow the lyrics as part of the listening in order to penetrate as more as possible into this fantasy story.What really differs is maybe the slightly increased use of more mellow parts, some with acoustic guitars, and the diverse singing style of Nichols, part of the varied atmosphere of the album.But again it is impossible for IQ to miss their main target, which is to produce elaborate, well-polished and grandiose Progressive Rock with lots of bombastic grooves and symphonic references.But these would mean nothing if there weren't of the fantastic melodies IQ are used to bring on surface.Despite the lyrical importance of the album the group still manages to keep a great balance between vocal and instrumental moments.Some of the best music ever produced by IQ is also included in this work and the listener will face series of smooth piano arrangements and calm vocal performance blended with powerful compositions full of sharp and angular synthesizers, pounding bass lines, hard drumming and shining guitar lines.The most impressive fact though is that the group decided to close the album with the longest track of the album, the 20-min. ''The Narrow Margin'', already a classic composition of IQ, full of changing climates, haunting melodies, dark passages and more uptempo moments with excellent and tight musicianship from the start to the very end.<p>A Progressive Rock classic?Maybe yes, definitely a Neo Prog classic considering how hard it is to come up with both an impressive concept story and a very long album, that never tires the listener.No doubt, IQ succeded in both sections with this album.Highly recommended.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=927592#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=927592\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=927592\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, March 10, 2013</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #927592)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=21717\"><strong>lazland</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=21717\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/21717/C9F46CF2-046E-4575-B1C8-33DFCCEEC05A.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThere is a reason sometimes when a wallow in sheer nostalgia is something more than wallowing in glory days of yore. There are \r\ncertain times when you listen to a certain slab of music, and remember just how damned good it was. No, change that. Just how \r\ndamned good it IS!<p>I had not listened to this wonderful concept album in a fair while until this evening, when, looking forward to the latest IQ opus I have \r\npre-ordered, I thought, let's go back. Let's remind myself of just why I am taking a punt on music I have not even heard yet, and \r\nwon't receive until at least two months after shelling out hard earned money.<p>This album, perhaps more than most, is why. I loved IQ from the very beginning, and followed them alongside the other exponents \r\nof the new wave of British prog. This one, released in 1997, demonstrated to me that IQ, perhaps better than any other \"neo\" act, \r\nwere capable of staying true to their roots and influences, but also taking them forward with the lush, almost orchestral, modern \r\ndigital era sound. For this is an album not rooted in 1974, but the late nineties. <p>It is a \"deep\" concept, for sure, and certainly one that many classic original prog bands would have been proud of. The story \r\nrevolves around a man tortured and imprisoned in solitary confinement experimentation, who is released into the wider world with \r\nunpleasant consequences and, tortured internally, returns to his lone self and world. <p>Just how, then, such a tome can give rise to such a brilliantly uplifting track such as Speak My Name is a bit of a mystery, and, in \r\nreality, speaks genius. The title track,  following a Who-esque Overture, sets the scene perfectly for what follows, a perfect blend of \r\nsymphonic musical story telling and precise, clinical, but also heartwarming in places, and never anything less than captivating \r\nvocally and musically. It also contains a marvellous guest sax piece - note to naysayers.....Genesis never had this!<p>Peter Nicholls is absolutely at the top of his game, more so than on Ever in my opinion, his voice gorgeously fragile in its strength \r\n(yes, much like Gabriel in that manner), but the real star and driving force behind all that is so Progressive on this album is Martin \r\nOrford, whose soundscapes dominate and provide such a lush musical storyline in themselves. Just listen to his burst on State of \r\nMine especially, which lead a gloriously heavy symphonic passage of music, which, itself, leads to a beautiful , expansive, duo on \r\npiano and electric guitar with Mike Holmes on Laid Low. When these segue into the dark and hard Breathtaker, you realise that this \r\nalbum is rather more than a carbon copy of days gone by, but something utterly unique and new.<p>The end epic, The Narrow Margin, clocking in at 20 minutes brings proceedings to a suitably grandiose end. In fact, it would not be \r\nuntil the ridiculously brilliant Harvest of Souls that the band would outdo themselves in how to bring expansive, epic, loud, and \r\nproud prog rock to life in such a warm way. This is a track of a band at the top of their game, a collective bringing complex fantasy \r\nto expansive life.<p>In a couple of months time, I, and other collaborators on this site who have followed IQ for over 30 years now, will, no doubt, wax \r\nlyrical about the maturity of the new album. There will be more than a few reading those reviews who were either babes in arms, or, \r\nGod forbid, not even born, when Subterranea was released. You will, no doubt, wonder just what all the fuss is about in the 21st \r\ncentury.<p>This album is what the fuss is all about. This album is more than just a paeon to 1970's glory, it is the sound of a band who \r\nproduced a work of such beauty and wondrous sounds in 1997 that made many of us just know that, seventeen years later, we \r\nwould still be listening to classy progressive rock, because such gorgeous sounds and thoughts simply could never die. To \r\nsummarise, you are still listening to prog because of albums such as this.<p>Five stars. Essential. Wondrous. Beautiful. Grandiose. Nicholls, Orford, Holmes, Jowitt, and Cook. IQ. No further explanation is \r\nnecessary.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1155592#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1155592\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1155592\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, March 29, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1155592)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ had a rocky road at the latter part of the 80s with a couple sub-stellar releases but managed to find a firm footing in the \r\nprogressive rock arenas once again with their 1993 comeback \"Ever.\" Apparently deciding to never repeat the mistakes of such \r\nbellyflops as \"Are You Sitting Comfortably?\" ever again, the band now had a stable lineup with creative juices just bubbling over in \r\nmega-effervescence and spent four years polishing their craft before they unleashed the grandiose double album monstrosity \r\nSUBTERRANEA which took all the excesses of prog and ran away with them unapologetically. This behemoth of a musical \r\nextravaganza will require many trips to the buffet, periods of stepping back for proper digestion and then further revisitation for the \r\nfull-on effect to properly gel within the listener's inner music box. <p>IQ stepped it up in every possible way on SUBTERRANEA. Firstly with the lyrical contents they deliver a highly complex story about a \r\nman (remaining mysterious and nameless) who was held captive for most of his life and deprived of the most ordinary of \r\nexperiences that most of us take for granted on a daily basis. After being released he's deluged by the Captain America effect \r\nmeaning that he has woken up to a world that has passed him by in every regard and his struggle to catch up leaves him destitute \r\nand grasping for his sanity. The story becomes a full-fledged musical soap opera as he falls in love with a girl named Maya, discovers \r\nothers who have been experimented and detained against their will and joins forces to take revenge against the miscreants who \r\ncarried out these atrocities. The plot fails and this same guy ends up back to the very isolation from which the story began thus \r\ncreating a full circle approach to story telling all the while backed up by some of the most compelling progressive musical deliveries \r\nthat the 90s had to offer.<p>Lucky for IQ that Peter Nicholls returned to the helm as vocalist and lyrical contributor in chief because he churns out some of the \r\nmost compelling yet mysteriously vague story content of his career as done right in true prog fashion leaving the other members to \r\nfocus exclusively on the musical accompaniment which is nothing short of brilliant as IQ dishes out some of the strongest melodies \r\nand song structures of their career with each cadence wresting a heart felt explosion of emotional reaction as keyboard lines tinkle \r\ntheir way into a gravitational pull that is utterly irresistible. The group interplay is beyond strong as even the longest of tracks such \r\nas the double-discker's closer \"The Narrow Margin\" keeps the listener enthralled for its entirety. Nicholls' vocal performance is \r\nabsolutely top notch and each track successfully builds upon what came before and creates a true complete album experience like \r\nvery few others of the newly resurrected prog universe of the 90s succeeded in accomplishing. <p>While it's no secret that IQ was always a Peter Gabriel era Genesis type of band, SUBTERRANEA can certainly bring the double album \r\n\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" to mind not only in its scope and delivery with accessible keyboard driven musical prosody \r\naccompanied by excellent lyrical elocution but offers a more obnubilated sense of meaning and only offers an impressionalist's \r\nperspective of a story that leaves more questions dangling about than it it answers however even if you couldn't give a flying bleep \r\nabout the lyrics, the music on this one offers a diverse array of neo-prog perfection that adheres to all the genre expectations of \r\nbeautifully laid out extended compositions that ratchet up the emotional responses in a systematic and melodic way. This isn't one \r\nfor the casual listener and like many complex works requires some commitment to understand but with a little devotion can be \r\neasily extricated from its inscrutable initial impressions.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1672722#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1672722\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1672722\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, December 26, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=619#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1672722)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5589\"><strong>The Crow</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5589\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5589/diesiraebox_sheetmusic041.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nSubterranea was the confirmation that after the Peter Nicholls comeback IQ was in top form!<p>And here we can find thanks to a pristine production a band which has become even more ambitious than the in the excellent \r\nEver, introducing elements like marimba and saxophone in some pieces and making their music darker and even more \r\ninteresting. <p>The only problem I have with Subterranea is that being a double CD, some track are just filling and they are not impressive. \r\nThat's a problem that almost every double disc album has, and this is not an exception.

As a double album, it's notoriously the difficulty to pull off but the concept and the songs \r\nnever reduce the work to mere ramblings. The music on \"Subterranea\" was written by IQ and the lyrics were \r\nwritten by Nicholls.<p>The line up on \"Subterranea\" is Peter Nicholls (lead and backing vocals), Mike Holmes (guitars), Martin Orford \r\n(backing vocals, flute and keyboards), John Jowitt (backing vocals and bass) and Paul Cook (drums and \r\npercussion). \"Subterranea\" had also the participation of Tony Wright (saxophone) as a guest musician.<p>In the end of 1994 the band started playing some new compositions to the audiences in their live shows. In \r\nNovember 1996 the band announced that the release of their new album would be in September 1997 and that \r\nthe band had decided to make a double conceptual album with theatrical stage show with a full length \r\nperformance of the album. So, the band worked hard at the different parts of the whole concept, the music, the \r\nlyrics, the sleeve and the stage. In June 1997 the recording sessions for the new album began. On August the \r\nfinishing touches were put on the mixing process to be finally released. The album features photographic \r\nartwork and pictures that illustrate the concept of the album.<p>The concept of \"Subterranea\" is focused about a man who's been the subject of an experiment. He's been held \r\ncaptive throughout his whole life not having contact with the outside world, till he's let loose in the outside \r\nworld. He has to digest all these new things. He gets involved with a religious cult, but he refuses to be \r\nconverted. One day, he meets a girl and fall in love with her. He has a romance with her but she is taken away \r\nfrom him. He became very anger. He realises that he's being watched and he's part of an experiment. He \r\ndecided to know why. He realises that he's not the only victim of the experiment. The victims decide to band \r\ntogether and take revenge. In a confrontation, he meets the responsible for the experiment. In the end, he \r\nresigns himself to going back into the same isolation where he started. <p>\"Subterranea\" is supposed to be the major work of IQ. And all means have been used to achieve that. IQ offers \r\nus more than an hour and a half of music on a double CD. To embarking on the writing of a conceptual album is \r\na necessary passage for any self-respecting prog band but it's a huge risk too. However, they completely won the \r\nchallenge. With such duration, the music of \"Subterranea\" is incredibly rich with a great atmosphere. As we \r\nknow, IQ is a band that knows how to transcribe emotions very well. The music is rooted in IQ's neo-prog past \r\nwith rather simple songs, driven by Martin Orford's keyboards and Peter Nicholls' theatrical and emotion-packed \r\nvocals, dressed in the progressive rock grandeur and with very strong melodies. This intense use of keyboards \r\nimmediately leads them to be labelled neo-progressive. Its use is pushed to the extreme with the many parts \r\nwhere it's doubled, the synthetic chords mixing with the piano.  However, unlike many bands that sound \r\npompous, IQ plays the card of finesse, creating an impressive work.<p>\"Overture\" and above all the subsequent \"Provider\" are great introductions despite the initial orchestral tuning. \r\nThe usual IQ clich\u00e9s are mature and very well dosed and the keyboard carpets sound new. In terms of \r\ncomposition, it's the smaller pieces that stand out. \"King Of Fools\" convinces with guitar synths, as does \"The \r\nOther Side\", the already mentioned \"Provider\" and also \"Laid Low\" or \"High Waters\". Here, the leitmotifs are \r\nusually brought out or presented, which are taken up in other pieces and chased through the instruments and \r\nvoices. As a result, \"Subterranea\" gains a coherent structure that is appropriate for a concept work. Here and \r\nthere, there are also a few adventures that IQ hadn't dared to do before, like cheeky disturbing gimmicks with \r\nmajor and minor in keyboard solos \"Failsafe\", over-the-top vibrato effects, \"Subterranea\" and \"Breathtaker\", and \r\nthe pitch delay as a harmony instrument on \"The Other Side\". And then there's \"The Narrow Margin\", the only \r\nlong track on the album. Here we have individual parts that are brought together into a harmonious whole by \r\nmany leitmotif connections, especially against the background of the album.<p>Conclusion: \"Subterranea\" is an amazing album. This conceptual album is so strong that practically eclipsed all \r\nthe previous studio albums of the group. It was also easily compared with \"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" \r\nof Genesis. I think there is something of it here, despite the concept be more cryptic and obscure and the music \r\nbe rooted in the neo-prog style. This is generally an underrated work of them. Despite the clearly differences, it \r\nreminds me \"Tales From Topographic Oceans\" of Yes. Both are two very misunderstood albums by many prog \r\nfans. I never hesitated in giving the highest rating to that album and I have no problems in doing the same with \r\nthis one too. For me, it's the best studio album of the band, so far, and one of the best albums ever. \r\n\"Subterranea\" is IQ's biggest musical accomplishment and will get under the skin of any prog fan. Definitely, I \r\nthink this is certainly one of the best progressive albums of the 90's.<p>Prog is my Ferrari.
