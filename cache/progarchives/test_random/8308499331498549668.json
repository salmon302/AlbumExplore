Ever is certainly the pinnacle album to have from IQ as it blends all elements delivering a well balanced, full concept like album. Musicianship is exceptionally high here with some great guitar/bass interplay covered by detailed, dark, symphonic synths which are surrounded by the detailed and solid drumming/percussion of Paul Cook. Peter Nichols delivers a solid vocal workout as well and brings in my opinion his best to the band here. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3697#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3697\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3697\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, March 13, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3697)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=228\"><strong>lor68</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=228\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/pyramid.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nProbably the best effort by IQ, a perfect balance in the middle between the mainstream exigencies, in the vein of a few bands from the UK, such as JADIS, and the Romantic style by the early GENESIS.

This record is one of the best concretization of a modern and original continuation of the GENESIS of the GABRIELl-era. After you've got the post-MARILLION neo prog culture, it becomes clear that the IQ albums of the 90's do not sound like MARILLION! They have their own sound and style. While MARILLION's prog principles and structured songs have brutally switched for a shocking & disappointing style of music, IQ progressed, refined their sound & production, and actually they never gave up, stronger than ever after each album made, especially this one. <p>This record contains VERY varied & professionally played keyboards parts. Unlike JADIS, Martin Orford does not only accompany the rest of the music; he absolutely produces unforgettable synth patterns, always melodic, magic, pleasant and emotional. The miscellaneous VERY melodic guitar solos and acoustic ones complete very well the sentimental and sophisticated omnipresent mood. Paul Cook's drums are, as always, excellent and varied. An interesting point is the bass: I really LOVE the very refined and subtle fretless parts! They fit so well with the other instruments! The bassist, John Jowitt, also played in JADIS: he is excellent here, never monotonous. Peter Nichols' lead vocals are very good, and the backing vocals are OUTSTANDING on \"Came Down\". I find the rhythm rather slow on most of the tracks: the musicians take the time to sound good and deliver emotions. <p>IQ is a band that has always progressed, and it now seems they are at their best! <p>EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED!\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3700#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3700\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3700\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, April 11, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3700)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=114\"><strong>richardh</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=114\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/114/af5d2032-17c8-4974-b74e-8526b424a141.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's masterpeice.Pete Nicholls returns and the band recover their purpose and direction.The songs,playing and production quality are of the highest with no real standout tracks but just a pleaure to listen to from front to back.A real desert island disc if EVER there was one!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3701#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3701\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3701\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, April 29, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3701)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=305\"><strong>Hibou</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAlthough subsequent IQ albums would prove to be quite a match, none (IMHO) equal this\r\nmasterpiece. Every single track on it has something magical about it and the album contains\r\nabsolutely no dead moments whatsoever: it is pure genius from beginning to end. It's as if the band members had taken the best of everything they had ever written and compressed it all into a 50-minute CD. The melodies, the arrangements, the many twists and turns, everything here fits in neatly to produce an hallucinating effect and showcases an incredible array of musical colours that leave the listener speechless. These guys can turn your senses about so easily it's almost painful. Granted, Peter Nicholl's voice may not be as dynamic or powerful as that of a ROB SOWDEN (ARENA) or a STU NICHOLSON (GALAHAD), but I can't imagine anyone else doing such a fine job as he has done here. This music is genial, exhilirating, breathtaking.<p>\"Ever\": the kind of album that makes you want to shout out loud 'Thank God for Prog!!!'</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3702#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3702\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3702\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, May 2, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3702)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1003\"><strong>chessman</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1003\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/avatars/eye_storm.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI bought this album recently, after purchasing The Seventh House. (Already reviewed \r\nby me.) I had heard that this one is regarded by some as their finest album. Well, it is \r\ncertainly a decent effort, and it is hard not to like it. The opener, The Darkest Hour, \r\nstarts out briskly enough, with nice guitar over keyboard, then settles into a steady \r\npaced rhthym, overlaid with a pleasant melody. There are some hints of Genesis here, \r\nboth guitar wise and vocally, but they are only faint ones. The song has some nice \r\ntextures and changes throughout, and the keyboards fill out the sound smoothly. I \r\nsuspect that Martin Orford is the dominant member of the band, although Peter Nicholls \r\ndoes have a distinctive voice and Mike Holmes is a technically gifted guitarist, although \r\nhe remains in the background much of the time. The track ends quietly and the album \r\nmoves on to the second cut, Fading Senses. This is divided into 2 parts, the first part \r\nbeing the vocal, which has some nice gloomy lyrics - right up my street! The second \r\npart is instrumental, and very melodic at that, well constructed and easy on the ear. \r\nThen comes the 3rd song, Out Of Nowhere, which is my least favourite on the album. \r\nDrums and keyboards fade in nicely, but then the guitar comes in with a blatant copy of \r\nQueen's Now I'm Here. In fact, I found myself singing the first couple of lines to it. Now \r\nI quite like Queen, but this riffing doesn't suit IQ at all. Once the song gets going, it is in \r\nfact not bad, but seems hastily put together, and is, in my opinion, the closest the \r\nband has come to 'filler' material. It seems almost 'poppy'.  However, the next track is \r\nthe epic Further Away, lasting nearly 15 minutes, with intricate changes and nice lyrics. \r\nA well crafted piece of music which shows the band at its best. All the musicians work \r\nwell here, and the song ebbs and flows. A good one! Track 5 is Leap Of Faith, which is \r\nanother favourite of mine. Although the melody is rather obvious, the guitar solo at the \r\nend is very well put together and is eminently listenable! This leads, finally, into the last \r\ntrack, Came Down. For some reason, this reminded me of Afterglow, off Wind And \r\nWuthering. From the way it is lead into, to the pace and style of the song. Not bad \r\nhowever! My three faves are The Darkest Hour, Further Away and Leap Of Faith. \r\nNone of this is essential, but I would have given it an extra half star if it had been \r\npossible. The Seventh Hour is far superior, in my opinion, but then everyone thinks \r\ndifferently! If there is such a thing as 'middle of the road' in prog, then IQ, and latter-\r\nday Marillion must be the leaders in it. The music is safe, pleasant, almost easy \r\nlistening. Technically excellent but without providing anything new to the genre. Worth \r\na listen though!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3705#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=3705\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=3705\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, December 5, 2004</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #3705)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5589\"><strong>The Crow</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5589\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5589/diesiraebox_sheetmusic041.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWonderful and pure Neo-Progressive!!!<p>This album represented the Peter Nichols's return to IQ after 8 years out of the\r\nband, and hearing this album you can taste the magic  between him and the rest of the\r\nband's musicians.

Oh no . \r\nthis is a fatal error! In fact, this album means a lot to me because it remarked the \r\nreturn of my trust with prog genre in 1997 / 1998. Why? Practically after Fish left \r\nMarillion, I did not see any future of prog music and I was not aware at all by the \r\ntime this album was released. Until one day I visited my old prog friend, Ricky, 's  \r\nhouse in Bandung sometime in 1997/1998. He played me this album and it struck my \r\nhead the first time he spun the CD for me. Fabulous music! I asked him on how he \r\npurchased the CD and he introduced me to Malcolm of Cyclops where I finally placed \r\nmy order of this CD. Yeah man . prog's back to my life again after practically 5 \r\nyears (or so) I was a passive prog lover. What I mean \"passive\" was that I still \r\nproggin' but I did not grow my collection - I just played old stuffs of Marillion first \r\nfour albums, early Genesis, Pink Floyd, VdGG, Gentle Giant, IQ The Wake, etc.<p>As I mentioned at my review on \"ForEver Live\", this album was uniquely released \r\nthrough a live performance that was recorded and released later in the double CD \r\nformat of \"ForEver Live\". So it's a critical album as far as the band's career in prog \r\nmusic arena. The masterpiece of masterpiece of six tracks presented here is \r\n<strong>Further Away</strong> where the band admitted themselves that this \r\nsong which consumes 14 minutes duration was hard to play on stage. They dropped \r\nthis track to be featured in the live CD after long tension during rehearsal. I have \r\nto admit that this track is so powerful in terms of neat composition, multi-part \r\nstructure, many tempo changes with very smooth transition. It starts off with a \r\nmellow and melodic opening of keyboard and vocals, augmented with innovative bass \r\nwork by John Jowitt. The first three minutes is truly a killing melody with \r\nharmonious sounds. At the end of of three minutes part the music blasts off in \r\nheavy mode with powerful soft guitar riffs and dynamic basslines. The excellent \r\nsonic quality helps elevate the great nuance of music with jaw dropping drum line. \r\nWOW! What an energetic music man ..!!! The song ends up with another mellow \r\npart with floating keyboard work. Masterpiece! (Note: whenever I play this album I \r\nalways repeat this track for 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 times. It's so rewarding my friend ..!)<p>Nothing is good track in this album as each track is totally excellent PLUS or \r\nmasterpiece. The opening track \"The Darkest Hour\" has a hard driving rhythm and \r\npounding bass lines augmented with keyboards. This rocking track with heavy 70s \r\nprog touch is performed excellently by the band. The band then provides a slower \r\ntrack with \"Fading Senses\" which has a catchy melody using excellent combination \r\nof Nicholl's voice and long sustain keyboard work by Orford. \"Out Of Nowhere\" \r\nbrings the music back into another upbeat tempo and high energy combining the \r\nwork of drums, bass and keyboard nicely - in a sort of staccato style music. \r\nPowerful music. The two concluding tracks \"Leap of Faith\" and \"Came Down\" wrap \r\nthe album excellently. These two songs also very strong in melody.<p>It's actually not a concept album from IQ. However, listening (read: enjoying!) this \r\nalbum is like going through a series of parts in one cohesive story because the \r\ncombination of melody, tempo, compositions and beats from one song to another \r\nhave formed naturally like a journey, like following a story. I have no little complaint \r\nat all with this wonderful album; even the sonic quality is excellent. I always play \r\nthis album with LOUD volume at my amplifier while reading the lyrics and sing \r\ntogether with Nicholls. It's a great joy, I tell you ..<p>So, how would I recommend this album to you? Simple, GET IT man! Especially if you \r\nlove symphonic prog with catchy melody in moderate complexity of the composition. \r\nYes, most of IQ music are not complex but they are very enjoyable and accessible \r\nto many ears. This album is a masterpiece of neo prog album. HIGHLY \r\nRECOMMENDED. <strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild Mother Brown has lost her child ...<p>Progressively yours, GW<p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=62313#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=62313\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=62313\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, December 30, 2005</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #62313)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=882\"><strong>Trotsky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ is one band I've really shifted position on over the last couple of years. While\r\nI'd previously dismissed all post-Fish Marillion neo-prog bands on the basis of some\r\nunfortunate encounters with Galahad and Pendragon, I was gradually won over to IQ's\r\ncause by the sheer power of their 2004 release Dark Matter. That album now stands\r\nalongside Marillion's best in my estimation, and it has caused me to investigate IQ's\r\npast with renewed vigour.<p>Ever was my first stop, and despite being a decade older than Dark Matter it sounds\r\nalmost like a sister album (lending weight perhaps to the accusation that IQ keep\r\nmaking the same album over and over again). The main strengths of IQ, in my opinion,\r\nare the vocal presence of Peter Nicholls and Martin Orford's keyboards, and they are\r\nvery much to the forefront here. I'd have to say that overall though, this is clearly\r\na weaker,  less consistent album than Dark Matter.<p>Although there are some strong (albeit occasionally pop-inflected) songs in Leap Of\r\nFaith and Come Down, this album can be quite frustrating. The Darkest Hour is rather\r\nmeandering and Out Of Nowhere is outright 80s pop-rock cliche. It's safe to say that\r\nthe shorter songs generally don't match the standards of the average composition on\r\nDark Matter and there are, in fact, times when my old prejudice against the \"overly\r\nsynthy synthesizers, tinny drums and bland lead guitar sounds\" of neo-prog resurfaces.<p>Even when this album comes into its own, on the 14 minute centerpiece Further Away,\r\nthe song drags on a bit. Still, it's surely one of IQ's best songs and gives notice\r\nof the kind of heights the band would later scale with Dark Matter. With an ethereal\r\nbeginning (all swirly bells and light dancing synths) underpinned by (the\r\noft-unnoticed) John Jowitt's delicate bass work, this piece is then led by Nicholls\r\ninto much rockier territory. It threatens to get boring after a while, but an Offord\r\nsynth special at the 7 minute mark threatens to turn the song on its head.\r\nUnfortunately the momentum is frittered away by the time the song concludes.<p>Still Ever is not too discouraging an album, and indeed might make quite a decent\r\nentry point for the newcomer ... as long as they bear in mind that the best was yet\r\nto come! ... 53% on the MPV scale</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=64735#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=64735\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=64735\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, January 14, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #64735)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1820\"><strong>NJprogfan</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter a few years hiatus, Mr Nichols returned to the fold and the band recorded a near \r\nmasterpiece. What I like most about IQ is the gothiness. Not many Neo-prog bands I can \r\nthink of that compares to IQ when it comes to mixing a gothic atmosphere with a tinge of \r\nmid-period Genesis. With Peter Nichols sad vocals singing songs of longing tied in with \r\nHolmes Hackett-like guitar and Olfords fantastic keyboard work, you have a combination \r\nthat, for me, is the best in the genre. The album starts off with a song titled, \"The Darkest \r\nHour\", which actually is NOT the darkest. It's more upbeat, especially in the beginning, \r\nalthough towards the end it slides into a more gothic groove. The following track, \"Fading \r\nSenses\" has all the trademarks of classic IQ., Nichol's haunting lyrics coupled with Olford's \r\nchurch/choir keys gives you a forboding feeling. It's in the second section of the song that \r\nHolmes guitar has a sadness that reminds you of classic horror soundtracks, vampire-like \r\nand spooky. Really cool song! \"Out Of Nowhere\" starts out rocking and is catchy as heck. \r\nA great 5 minute track. \"Further Away\" is the longest track and has the sound that IQ \r\nwould use for the rest of their career up to this day. Very Genesis like courtesy of Holmes \r\nguitar, you'll definately hear \"Wind And Wuthering\" throughout the song, but he does have \r\nhis own style especially when he reaches the higher, soaring notes. A fantastic track with \r\nOlford going crazy on keyboards halfway through. \"Leap Of Faith\" and \"Came Down\" meld \r\ntogether to make up another long track. Nichol's best singing are on these songs, \r\nwith \"Leap Of Faith\" another classic IQ track with that wonderful gothic feeling running \r\nthroughout. Olford definately takes some cues from Banks on this track, (Listen at the 5 \r\nminute mark). Overall, you can't go wrong with this album. A classic in the genre and a \r\ngood starting point for the new to neo-prog. Is it their best? Not yet, but it's damn close. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=80743#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=80743\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=80743\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, June 9, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #80743)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1117\"><strong>Cygnus X-2</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1117\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20061019_175801_Assassing1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's album Ever ushered in the return of Peter Nichols to the lineup after a brief\r\nhiatus in the late 80s (in which they recorded two albums with a different vocalist,\r\nNonzamo and Are You Sitting Comfortably?). This album also ushered in a return to the\r\nmore progressive IQ, as their previous two efforts were more mainstream oriented and\r\nthey lost the edge that they once had. What you can expect from this album is\r\nintricate and technical instrumental passages coupled with well timed and well\r\nexecuted vocal sections to create some of the most complex neo prog out there. The\r\nentire band shines, from the lush and melodic solos of Mike Holmes, to the keyboard\r\nwizardry of Martin Orford, to the precise and superb bass playing of John Jowitt, and\r\nto the technical and lush drumming of Paul Cook. This album is not their best, but it\r\ncertainly is not their worst.<p>The Darkest Hour opens the album strong with some solid riffing in 7/8 and some great\r\nkeyboard textures from Orford. Once Nichols voice enters the song, the listener can\r\nalready hear the old IQ come back. Add some solid guitar arpeggios from Holmes and\r\nsome solid drumming from Cook. The chorus breakdown is a nice mixture of solid bass\r\ntextures and some great synthesizer lines from Orford. Expect some solid and\r\nintricate instrumental sections for the rest of the 10 minutes, it's surely worth it.\r\nFading Senses is a nice acoustic guitar driven tune. The grand piano also has a great\r\ntheme, and the bass line is very well written. The middle of the song is where the\r\ngroup finally all kicks in. Mike Holmes gives a very dynamic guitar solo here before\r\na strong chord based riff is presented. Martin Orford then gets his chance to show\r\nhis skill and gives a very spacey keyboard solo before a strong keyboard based\r\nascending riff is played. <p>Out of Nowhere fades in with a strong 7/4 riff before a guitar based riff is played\r\nunder Nichols vocal. This is one of the poppier tracks on the album, but none the\r\nless it is a strong song. Further Away is the second epic of the album, clocking in\r\nat around 14 minutes. A very keyboard based introduction is augmented with a fitting\r\nflute motif compliment of Martin Orford. Jowitt really shines during this\r\nintroduction, giving a dynamic bass performance that couples well with the swells of\r\nMike Holmes' guitar. Strong riffs in 6/4 that sounds reminiscent of one of the themes\r\nin Born Brilliant (or is it the other way around?). This is the opus of the album,\r\nwith a spectacular closing instrumental section that really showcases the skills of\r\nMike Holmes.<p>Leap of Faith features some creative Holmes riffing and a more Marillion circa Script\r\nFor a Jester's Tear sound in terms of atmosphere. A strong 7/8 riff is played the\r\n3:30 mark; man do IQ love the time signature 7/8. The reprisal of a riff from The\r\nDarkest Hour is played here; this riff I speak of is in 5/8. Came Down closes the\r\nalbum with a melodic Mike Holmes solo and some very epic lyrics from Nichols. In the\r\nend, themes from the rest of the album are presented and played very effectively,\r\ngiving the album a fitting ending.<p>Overall, Ever was IQ's return to the status quo. They hit the mark again with this\r\nalbum and there's not much I can fault this album with, except that there really is\r\nno real invention in IQ's sound. But other than that, there is not a lot to dislike\r\nabout this album. 4.5/5.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81656#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=81656\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=81656\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 21, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #81656)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=6\"><strong>Peter</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=6\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/F7ED2_Nektar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nEVER, a 1993 entry from IQ, is my third acquisition from these quintessential neo-proggers, and  provides me with yet more impetus to further explore the English band's catalogue: I've not been disappointed yet.<p>Yes, this is another very strong album from the group who are arguably the strongest act working today in \"neo progressive,\" the sub-genre which hearkens back to the classic prog of the 70s. Given that EVER is a neo prog album, there is really no \"new\" musical ground being broken here, but that's not why we listen to IQ. No, we don't play IQ to explore strange new musical lands (leave that, perhaps, to bands such as the Mars Volta, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Deus Ex Machina, and others). Rather, one listens to IQ to re-visit the pomp and magic of early prog - albeit through a modern sonic and technological filter. For my money, no current band can evoke that vaunted bygone era better than IQ. If you're a fan of classic \"symphonic\" progressive rock, and are open to discovering some newer stuff in the same vein, you need to get into these guys!<p>Nor are IQ mere pale imitations (see Pendragon) of their honoured predecessors. Although their sound and inspiration clearly go back to acts like mid-seventies Genesis (as with Marillion, if there had been no Genesis, there'd likely have been no IQ - at least not in this form), IQ display enough originality and just plain strong songwriting skills to steer adequately clear of \"rip-off\" or \"clone\" territory. On this disc (as on others - see my reviews of THE WAKE and DARK MATTER), IQ push all of the right prog buttons, and at the right time. (Indeed, they show laudable restraint in not employing the entirety of their classic prog palate in every song. Unlike certain other popular neo acts, they know when to end a song - or album - and keep matters tight and focused.) There is prog rock power and polish to spare on EVER, in harmonious balance with generous amounts of real beauty, evocative lyrics that bear more than a cursory examination, and, as ever, top-notch musicianship and a deserving conviction \r\nin the material.<p>Each of the six pieces here represents prog listening time very well spent, so I'll forgo track by track analysis, but to say that the fourteen minute-plus \"Further Away\" is truly epic, awesome and varied just as longer prog pieces should be. The last two numbers, \"Leap of Faith\" and \"Came Down\" (which dovetail into a unitary whole) are also especially good - there is a grandeur here that hasn't been so convincingly heard since before Hackett left Genesis, or ELP alienated many of their fans with the tangential excesses of their WORKS albums.<p>From thunderous opening to majestic close, EVER is an album to play again and again. Symphonic and neo fans take heed: IQ is a band to listen to, and you just can't go wrong with EVER. Four stars: unless your prog listening sticks stubbornly to the 70s, you should have this delightful disc in your collection. Great stuff -- crank it up, close your eyes, and smile!    \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=84387#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=84387\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=84387\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 21, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #84387)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11816\"><strong>Modrigue</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11816\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11816/PA-Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>IQ's best album of the 90's</strong><p>3.5 stars<p>After the commercial orientation taken during the Paul Menel late 80's years, this 1993 opus marks the return of historical singer Peter Nicholls as well as IQ's renaissance. I am not a neo-prog fan, but this record deserves some attention. \"Ever\" \r\ncontains interesting and inspired moments and is probably the result of what would have \r\nhappened if PINK FLOYD had made a child to DREAM THEATER (or the opposite...).<p>The disc starts by stetting down a dark and magic atmosphere with \"The Darkest Hour\". It \r\ngoes on with catchy guitar riffs reminiscent of RUSH. The melody is peaceful, alternating \r\nwith mysterious and calm passages. \"Fading Senses\" contains two parts. The first one is \r\nquite enchanting and enjoyable, and the second part features an egyptian-like space metal \r\nriff. Mindblowing! \"Out of Nowhere\" has some DREAM THEATER's \"Images\"' accents and is a \r\nrather rocky tune.<p>The 14 minutes epic \"Further Away\" features IQ in top shape! The \r\nintroduction transports you in a fairytale place, to let a darker and heavier atmosphere take \r\nplace. An heavy metal fantasy piece. Guitar and keyboards solos reveal knights and \r\nwizards. The final is pretty calm and spacey. However, the three last minutes are maybe \r\nunnecessary. The end of the disc is the weakest part. \"Leap of Faith\" contains interesting \r\nmoments but sounds sometimes lazy and the last song \"Came Down\" is quite quite cheesy.<p>\"Ever\" is IQ's most inspired effort during the nineties and features ones of their great epic tracks. \r\nRecommended to discover IQ or to DREAM THEATER and PINK FLOYD fans not into neo-\r\nprogressive genre. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=108246#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=108246\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=108246\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, January 21, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #108246)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10301\"><strong>evenless</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong> Best IQ album Ever? </strong><p>If I would have to mention my favourite IQ album 3 titles immediately come to mind: 1) \r\nEver, 2) Subterranea and 3) Dark Matter.

With this \r\none, we\"ll be back to the roots. On both sides.<p>First ; the old IQ sound is fortunately back ! Second : Peter Nicholls is again on the \r\ncommand of the lead vocals. Not that I disliked Paul Menel (I have already expressed \r\nmy opinion about this in the appropriate reviews). So, I was really thrilled to discover \r\nthis \"old\" new IQ album (do you follow me ?).<p>We are immediately brought back in the mood of their early work with the opening \r\nnumber : \"The Darkest Hour\". It holds all the items IQ fans love (which are equal to the \r\nones that their distractors hate). This great song is with no doubt reminiscent of \r\nGenesis, but IQ has never denied this filiation. When you see them played live, \r\nNicholls's tone of voice will automatically remind you with the other Peter's one. But I \r\nguess that I must be a privileged one for having seen Peter with Genesis on stage \r\n(back in April 1975) and be able to compare.<p>IQ is a band that I appreciate a lot. Live or in the studio. They bring me lots of emotion. \r\nJust listen to \"Fading Senses\" to hear what I'm talking about. This rather simple song is \r\njust beautiful. Peter sounding a bit sad and lonely, though. But so is he. And so I love \r\nhim. <p>If you ever would like to be sure about IQ's influence, I guess that the intro of \"Out Of \r\nNowhere\" will give you the answer. \"Watcher Of The Skies\" man !\r\nSince they are doing it with such respect for the band we all praised on PA, I can not \r\neven be worried with the similarity. Just a wink. There will even be an almost similar riff \r\nas in \"Now I'm Here\" from Queen (you know, the rock band) further on in this song. The \r\nfinale though is again fully \"Watcher\" inspired.<p>The second long song \" Further Away\" won't hold the untold promises of its lenght. Just \r\nanother good IQ song, but no real and splendid epic. One could have hoped something \r\nmore grandiose from IQ. It will hold its portion of emotion and Mike will display a very \r\nnice guitar break just ahead the finale which is fully Genesis oriented again. But it is a \r\nbit too short for an almost fifteen minutes song.<p>One of my preferred  song on this album is \"Leap Of Faith\". Very nice keys for this \r\ngentle song. Simple and effective. Mike will be great again during his finale solo. It will \r\nnicely flow into \"Came Down\" which will beautifully close the album. But the mood is a bit \r\ntoo much on the sad side and Genesis is too much present. <p>I fully adhere to the fact that this enormous band (from 1970 till 1978) has been a \r\nmajor source of inspiration for a lot of bands, but still I would expect some more \r\npersonality, even from IQ which I like very much.<p>This album is of course much better than the two previous studio ones from the Menel \r\ndays. Again, I' m not sure that this line-up would have generated better stuff in those \r\ndifficult days (end of eighties) . <p>I'm just happy to listen to some good IQ music again but I can hardly go beyond three \r\nstars in my rating. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=123476#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=123476\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=123476\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, May 26, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #123476)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI don't think there is any doubt that the band came into the recording studio (to make this \r\nalbum) with a renewed passion and emotion. After all he was back wasn't he ? The \"he\" \r\nbeing Peter Nicholls who last sang for IQ on \"The Wake\" album some 8 years \r\nprevious.They also had a new bass player for this one in John Jowitt, so you know there \r\nwas a renewed energy and the creative juices were flowing. <p>\r\n\"The Darkest Hour\" opens in such an outstanding way with keys, guitars and drums.They \r\nare back ! Then we get to hear the vocals of Peter Nicholls as he joins in. And i'm sure the \r\nfaithful IQ fans (who hoped for this reunion of the band with Peter for some 8 long years) \r\nhad a lump in their throats at this point.The waves of synths are great before the 6 minute \r\nmark, and the soaring guitar 8 mintes in from Holmes doesn't disappoint. Orford closes this \r\nsong out with lots of piano melodies. \"Fading Senses\" is a mellow reflective song that is \r\ndominated by keys and vocals, that is until the change in mood 3 minutes in. When pounding \r\ndrums and heavy guitar take over, as synths come and go.<p>\"Out of Nowhere\" opens with \r\nthe birds singing as drums and mellotron come in. We are treated to a good rhythm as \r\nbass, drums and guitar provide support to Peter's fantastic vocals.This is a catchy tune \r\nwith some majestic mellotron after 3 minutes as well as later.  \"Further Away\" opens with \r\nlight keys and mellotron as vocals come in. This is a slow moving mellow tune until the drums \r\nsignal a change 3 minutes in.The band sort of lets it rip ! They just rock out, it's great ! They \r\ndo settle back to original melody before returning back to the uptempo soundscape. \"Leap \r\nof Faith\" opens with reserved vocals and light keys, the sound is heavenly 2 minutes \r\nin. Eventually the keys and guitar trade solos.This song blends right into \"Came Down\". It \r\nfeatures these slowly pounding drums as a tasteful guitar melody is played. Vocals and \r\nsynths arrive to add more beauty to the pastoral ending of this record.<p>\r\nI'm not surprised to hear how many people rate this IQ album as their favourite. It is rather \r\nreserved, tasteful and beautiful. A triumphant comeback record for this great band.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=124804#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=124804\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=124804\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, June 6, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #124804)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8503\"><strong>Fight Club</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ's <em>Ever</em> marks the return of vocalist, Peter Nicholls and a more solid sound. After a few weak albums, IQ seems to have found \r\ntheir sound with this one. The Genesis and 70s progressive rock influence is more clear again and with Peter's voice back in the \r\nmix it seems IQ may have made one of the strongest neo-prog albums of the 90s.<p>This is a very strong album by perhaps the most notable act in the neo-prog scene today. This album echoes back to the glory \r\ndays of Fish-era Marillion and Gabriel-era Genesis. There's not really anything highly innovative going on here, but don't get me \r\nwrong it's still a good album. I'm very glad to see the return of Nicholls on this album, because in my opinion he is one of the \r\nessential ingredients to IQ's sound. He is one of the things that separates IQ from the loads of other Genesis and Marillion \r\nimitators. He has an operatic voice like that of Fish and Gabriel, but it also has a unique \"twang\" that makes it not just another \r\nneo-prog group, but IQ.<p>However, I find that the great and unique sound of his voice is also one of the things that makes IQ weak at times. When I listen \r\nto their music I often find that a great deal of emphasis is placed on the vocals and lyrics. You might be thinking \"so what, don't a \r\nlot of musicians do that?\" but the problem is the music is somewhat sacrificed for vocals. Don't get me wrong there are still a good \r\namount of catchy themes and guitar work, it's just I find the more interesting stuff goes on when Nicholls isn't singing. This isn't \r\nalways the case though, which is most proved on <em>Ever</em>. Almost 100% emphasis is placed on the musical quality.<p>The opener, <strong>\"The Darkest Hour\"</strong> is a great example of the overall sound produced by IQ. Starting out with a great 7/8 bass \r\ngroove and keyboards harmonies, the track proves the band can be witty and dynamic while keeping a sense of emotion and \r\ngood songwriting. It's unconventional, elaborate and cohesive, representing all of the aspects of IQ's prolific career.<p>Production is excellent. The omnipresent keyboards and guitar with loads of delay offers a very clear 80s sound. Everything has \r\na very live feel to it, like it's echoing throughout a stadium. The listener can feel the piano and clean guitar tones reverberating \r\noff the walls like they are in the midst of the greatest concert of their life. It is all very lush and very clear.<p>They touch upon a various number of feeling and emotions as the album progresses from one song to another. Ranging from the \r\njittery excitement of <strong>\"Darkest Hour\"</strong> to almost a sense of impending doom on <strong>\"Fading Senses\"</strong>, this album is a trip for the listener. \r\nThis is accentuated by the use of eccentric keyboard solos and pulsating bass grooves. These accomplished musicians give \r\neverything they have, which is one of the reasons I appreciate their style so much.<p>Musical skill is not the top priority with this group, however. As good as the keyboard and bass player are (who I am most \r\nimpressed by) they don't sacrifice sound for musicianship. The guitarist often shows his true lights through the winding guitar \r\nsolos and crescendos. Unfortunately, I don't find that the drummer offers much to the dynamics here. Not many polyrhythms or \r\nsyncopation here ladies and gentleman.<p>Out of all the positive points I have mentioned in my review, there are a couple things that drag this album down significantly. At \r\ntimes the music can seem to be going nowhere as if the band doesn't have an idea of what to write next. Instead of cutting out \r\nthe tedious parts they tend to leave them in, which drags the music on for longer than it should. An example of this would be the \r\n14-minute <strong>\"Leap of Faith\"</strong>. While it has some great themes and memorable moments, it just does not need to last 14 minutes. If \r\ncondensed by a few minutes it may stand as a better, shorter song. The band can often be tedious, which is why this is a better \r\nalbum than the 100-minute <em>Subterranea</em>. The music often seems very dependent on the soaring keyboards as well. The guitar \r\nriffs are always low in the mix and offer more as filler than a vital contribution to the sound. As I said before as well, the drums \r\nonly keep a constant backbeat and don't use much variation. This can tend to be boring for a non-progger.<p>IQ is one of the more \"classic\" sounding modern progressive acts, and one of the best of them, but they still haven't put out a \r\ntrue masterpiece album. <em>Ever</em> has tight compositional songwriting and some good themes, but it simply does not have the \r\ninspiration and memorable hooks to achieve masterpiece status. For those new to prog, this album will be a grower, getting \r\nbetter and better with each listen. However, for people used to the prog formula this album will seem to rehash the old cliches of \r\nthe great 70s acts and may grow old with extended listening. Therefore, being not quite a classic but still topping most 90s prog I \r\ngive this album an 8/10. Very good release, but nonessential.<p><strong>My rating: 8/10</strong></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=144288#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=144288\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=144288\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 13, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #144288)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15928\"><strong>progrules</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15928\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15928/cover_1325619920091.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs a true neo-progger I'm having a hard time reviewing IQ-albums. IQ is one of the most important neo prog bands in history but still \r\nI can't find my way to really liking them. I don't know if it's the mellow voice of Peter Nicholls that causes the problem or the fact that \r\ntheir music simply doesn't have the energy that's required to suit my taste. Probably it's a combination of those two that is the \r\nreason I will never be a real IQ-fan.<p>Still I bought a number of albums by this band, because well, you can never be sure about your opinion and this bands gets a lot of \r\ncredits so they have to come from somewhere. Maybe I'm misjudging them, another reason is that Subterranea was one of my first \r\npurchases and I did like that one, so that also makes you think: you never know, there might be another jewel in their discography.<p>How about Ever ? Well, to begin with: this album contains the best IQ-song ever to me, Further away (maybe along with Narrow \r\nMargin). This is a great song, very good composition, nice instrumental passages and quite energetic for IQ standard. And there are \r\nthree more songs on this release I'm quite fond of: Darkest Hour, Fading senses and especially Leap of faith which was a pleasant \r\nsurprise to me last time I checked out the disk.<p>So all in all this wasn't so bad, I really do believe IQ has too much class to deserve 1 or 2 stars (except for The Wake which was \r\nreally poor to me). Still I can't imagine me giving any album by this band 5 stars. They are just not really my cup of tea. Still 4 stars \r\nfor this (3.5).</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155277#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=155277\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=155277\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, December 13, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #155277)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=378\"><strong>Cesar Inca</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nBeing arguably the most solid band to emerge from the modern wave of 80s British prog rock, IQ has \r\nreleased some real masterpieces that honor both their career and the prog genre in general (inc. neo, \r\nof course). One of those master opuses has to be \"Ever\", the 1993 release that marked the return of \r\nvocalist Peter Nicholls, the presentation of newcomer bass player John Jowitt and the starting point for \r\nthe second (and best) musical era for the band. Everything that had been missed since the \"Wake\" \r\ndays is here: melodically ambitious compositions, true symphonic arrangements, lyrics as evocative as \r\nthey are mysterious. Nicholls' singing has varied, since the punk-friendly edge is gone in favor of a \r\nmore subtle nuance, which in turn makes his voice exploit its melancholic potential more thoroughly. \r\nAnd this is where the new things begin to make themselves noticed: a more introspective vibe in the \r\ncompositions, an enhanced poetry in Nicholls' lyrics, a more balanced sound production, a more \r\nfocused dynamics in the rhythm section. In many ways, \"Ever\" encapsulates the sort of mood and \r\nsound that the first Nicholls-era albums were headlong for but didn't manage to accomplish. The \r\nalbum's mood clearly signals a new melodic predominance, as it became to be confirmed in \r\nthe \"Subterranea\" and \"Seventh House\" albums, but there is also a particular reason for the overall \r\nmelancholy of \"Ever\": relatives and friends were gone from this world during the writing and recording \r\nof the band's material, so that had to inspire the dominant atmosphere of meditation and reflectivity in \r\na very strong way. The opening epic 'The Darkest Hour' kicks off with a powerful instrumental prologue \r\nthat sounds like the prog dream unfulfilled in the Menel days: something like Rush meets Genesis with \r\na touch of Camel, which wouldn't have been out of place beside 'Wurensh' (from \"Are You Sitting \r\nComfortably?\") or 'Human Nature' (from \"Nomzamo\"). Once Nicholls settles in, the whole band is driven \r\nback to the \"Wake\" days with the refurbished scheme that I've described earlier. The sung epilogue \r\nstates a beautifully emotional moment of serene sadness, properly driven by the piano lines. 'Fading \r\nSenses' coherently succeeds 'The Darkest Hour' concerning the aforesaid prologue: its sung section is \r\nkind of bucolic, reinforcing the momentum's tranquil sadness; the instrumental second section is eerie, \r\nalmost dreamy, exploiting the main motif's simplicity very craftily. 'Out of Nowhere', with its up tempo \r\npace and hooks, explores the pop-related facet of neo-prog with undisputed tightness. It bears enough \r\nroom to provide some of Holmes' lighter side and Orford's AOR ghosts. Speaking of ghosts, here \r\ncomes 'Further Away', the \"Wuthering Heights\"-inspired epic that incarnates the album's most \r\nbombastic moments. All the way through the melodies and arranged sequences we hear the succession \r\nof sadness, anger, despair and hope that signal the two main characters' love story. Holmes' final lead \r\nis just awesome, the ensemble's deliveries are solidly driven through the recurring 6/8 and 9/8 \r\nsignatures, and Nicholls states one of his finest performances in the album. After this highlight comes \r\nanother, 'Leap of Faith', a beautiful song that starts as a piano-led mid tempo and eventually turns into \r\na typical prog parade of well-crafted guitar/key solos and fluidly shifting signatures. The segued closing \r\nballad 'Came Down' pertinently culminates the overall mood displayed in the album. Despite being a \r\nslow song and not bearing overwhelming keyboard orchestrations, it feels really powerful. IQ \r\nfor \"Ever\"!      </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=179954#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=179954\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=179954\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, August 18, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #179954)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17213\"><strong>LiquidEternity</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17213\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17213/jayne-hat.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWith this release, IQ added a lot of flavor into the neo-prog genre.<p>In a category of music often cited as being fairly stale and not very involved, IQ stands as one of\r\nthe most innovative and creative forces. Not content just to rehash sounds first heard from the\r\nsymphonic acts of the 70s, IQ dances forward with some modern sounds and a good bit more appropriate\r\naggression. I think the divining factor here that makes IQ and especially Ever is the level of\r\nenergy the band puts into their music. A lot of neo-prog bands write long songs with progressive\r\nelements, but they power these songs with melodic melancholy more often than not. While IQ's music\r\nis not necessarily happy or even not melancholic, somehow they pump their music full of some sort of\r\ninterest and energy. One factor in this is the voice of the band, Peter Nicholls. His charismatic\r\nand unique voice adds a level of excellence to this band that is missing from most of their peers.\r\nAlso, the rest of the band plays on a high wire, balancing fast but melodic guitar lines with\r\nexcellent drum and bass rhythm work.<p>Each of the songs here has its own identity and its own strengths. The opener The Darkest Hour is a\r\nmore standard IQ tune, setting the benchmark for what their average song should sound like. Fading\r\nSenses and Out of Nowhere are both high energy bits with some great keyboard patches and a lot of\r\nbottom (also an element often missing from neo-prog). The album epic, Further Away, is probably the\r\nleast interesting track to me, but even still it is a splendid tune to listen to. Leap of Faith\r\nfeatures a wonderful instrumental conclusion with wild bass and some absolutely lovely keyboard\r\nwork. The final track, Came Down, flows from Leap of Faith very nicely, and wraps up the album in a\r\nvery gentle and beautiful way. The tracks all stand on their own, true, but the album works very\r\nnicely as a whole.<p>If you aren't very familiar with the neo-prog genre, this is an ideal place to begin. This is\r\nprobably the height of the genre, right here.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=184478#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=184478\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=184478\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 2, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #184478)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20269\"><strong>SouthSideoftheSky</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Symph&#111;nic Team</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20269\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20269/10943798_1601920700041800_9110454842985556060_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Leap of faith</strong><p>Unlike other subgenres here on Prog Archives, the Neo-Prog genre seemed to have taken a long time to get off the ground. Most of the usual suspects like Pallas, Pendragon, and IQ all started out already in the late 70's/early 80's but it wasn't until the 90's and 00's that they made their best works. (The majority of the albums in the Neo-Prog top 20 are from the new millennium which stands in sharp contrast to all other subgenres where most or even all of the top albums are from the genre in question's first few years of existence). After four albums in the 80's, IQ entered the 90's with Ever, which was their strongest release at the time and remains a classic of (Neo)progressive Rock. <p>The band's first two albums suffered from bad production and after that original vocalist Peter Nicholls left the band. Then they made two further albums with a different vocalist which received a somewhat lukewarm reception from the fans. In my opinion, all of the first four albums had at least some good moments, but it was on Ever that all the pieces finally fell into place. Nicholls returned for the present album which, in my opinion, was the album on which IQ finally found the direction that they would follow on subsequent albums. Ever is thus, as I see it, the first album by IQ as we know them from later releases. (This is not to say that the two albums with Paul Menel on lead vocals are bad (I actually enjoy Are You Sitting Comfortably?), but they are so different from later IQ releases that they could have been by a different band.) <p>I have to admit that I haven't always liked this album (or the band) as much as I do now. Looking back, I cannot quite see why, as this is excellent music! This album has grown on me over the years since I first heard it and I have now added a fourth star to my initially lower (too low!) rating. Ever is a great album and certainly one of IQ's best <em>ever</em> (together with the more recent Dark Matter).<p>Highly recommended!\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=235281#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=235281\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=235281\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, August 26, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #235281)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25408\"><strong>TheGazzardian</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25408\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25408/DruidDogGreen.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe earliest IQ album I've heard, and if the progarchives ratings are to be believed, their best to date. Ironically, \r\nof the three of their albums I've heard so far, this one is my least favorite. Unlike Dark Matter, there is no one \r\nsong that really lifts the album up. This album is roughly as good as Frequency, to me; great music in typical \r\nNeo/Symphonic manner.<p>The stronger tracks on the album include Out of Nowhere, which rocks really well with both the keys and the \r\nguitars, and Further Away, which has some lower points that prevent it from being the best it could be, but has \r\nsome of the highest moments on the album (especially some of the keyboard parts). Came Down finds Peter \r\nNicholl's singing with a bit more delicacy than on the rest of the album, but there's really not much else I can \r\nthink to say about it.<p>Other than that, this album doesn't sound particularly different from the other IQ I have heard, so there is not \r\nmuch more to say. Another good three star album.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=258174#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=258174\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=258174\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, December 28, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #258174)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nOut of the three IQ albums that I've experienced so far <em>Ever</em> is easily my favorite but that isn't really saying much considering that I can't call it an excellent album experience.<p>\r\nThe album consists of six compositions where two are masterful, two great and two not so much. <em>The Darkest Hour</em> belongs to the latter category because it doesn't justify its length of 11 minutes. If anything, this is more like a 5 minute composition stretched out to the 11 minute mark by adding a keyboard and guitar solos. It might have just as well been stretched out to a 15 minute mark by adding a bass and a drum solo as well! The chorus melody is pretty bland and doesn't make the whole experience all that interesting to my ears. <em>Fading Senses</em> is a nice ballad that somehow manages to incorporate a very grand sounding conclusion that doesn't really have much to do with the first 4 minutes of the song. <em>Out Of Nowhere</em> is a miss for me since this is just another uncomfortable stab at creating a single and doesn't add up to much for us who want to hear Neo-Prog.<p>\r\nAfter a weak first half the album manages to pull off a majestic second act that at first even made me believe that <em>Ever</em> had a chance at excellence. <em>Further Away</em> might not be the most interesting 15 minute composition but it does offer a solid flow from start to finish placing itself somewhere between a good and an excellent performance. Luckily once <em>Leap Of Faith</em> hits the speakers with the memorable keyboard intro we finally get the first truly excellent composition from IQ! What breath of fresh air after prog by numbers up until now! I also have to give the band credit for not expanding this performance into another lengthy track which might have been difficult to resist considering all of the masterful moments incorporated here. <em>Came Down</em> is a continuation of the previous track with a transition that reminds me of <em>Afterglow</em> from <em>Wind And Wuthering</em>. This is a luscious ballad that ends the album on a high note.<p>\r\nJust like Marillion's transition from <em>Script For A Jester's Tear</em> to <em>Fugazi</em> and <em>Misplaced Childhood</em> the sound offered on <em>Ever</em> is not on this as dark as it was on <em>The Wake</em>, especially since the '90s production makes a huge improvement in the sound production department. The album comes close to excellence and have it not been for the shaky first half then I wouldn't hesitate to give it a higher rating.<p>***** star songs: Leap Of Faith (7:21) Came Down (5:56)<p>**** star songs: Fading Senses (6:35) Further Away (14:30)<p>*** star songs: The Darkest Hour (10:52) Out Of Nowhere (5:09)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=279432#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=279432\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=279432\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, April 26, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #279432)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8691\"><strong>Flucktrot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8691\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070908_201329_joshuatree.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nPerhaps there is something that others are getting from this album, based on the proportion of those\r\nwho say that Ever is IQ's best album, but I have to say that if I listed my top 3 albums from the\r\nband, Ever would definitely be left out (maybe even left out of my top 5). Historically it is\r\nimportant in that IQ reunited when it seemed unlikely there would be more output from them, but I\r\nhear a band that is still finding its new direction. Nicholls continues to improve his delivery, the\r\nproduction is improved, and the compositions--especially the extended ones--are tighter, but all of\r\nthese factors would noticeably improve on this in later albums.<p>The Darkest Hour is the highlight, and it ranks up in the top 10 or so tracks released by the band,\r\nin my opinion. It's catchy, bouncy, and was also very fun to see live. Great way to kick off the\r\nalbum, and to announce that IQ is back with great music.<p>However, the rest of the album is more mixed to me. The longest piece, Further Away, has some solid\r\nmoments, such as the heavy 6/4 section, but the softer parts are just not exciting enough to\r\nsufficiently lead into or out of the exciting bits. On other tracks, such as Fading Senses and Leap\r\nof Faith, there are some decent melodies and somewhat creative varying of time signatures, but in my\r\nopinion the tempo is simply too slow. Compared to Seventh House, when IQ would nicely kick up the\r\ntempo when they had a rocking line, in these tracks, they just don't seem confident enough to give\r\nit the gas that the material deserves. <p>So, the seeds for future prog greatness are planted with Ever, but they just needed a few more years\r\nto really begin to bear fruit. Certainly some solid neo-prog, but for me, the music on Ever fits the\r\nphrase \"good, but non-essential\" like a glove. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=286218#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=286218\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=286218\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, June 12, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #286218)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15596\"><strong>stefro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15596\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15596/STEF.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nFeaturing the return of original lead-singer Pete Nicholls, 'Ever' was IQ's fifth album and a \r\nmost welcome return to their neo-prog roots after the ill-judged major-label pop-rock of \r\n1987's 'Nomzamo' and it's 1989 follow-up 'Are You Sitting Comfortably?'. Neither album had \r\nbeen particularly well received and, following the decision of the band's label Phonogram to \r\ndrop the group, Nicholls replacement Paul Menel and original bassist Tim Esau both quit \r\nin search of musical pastures new, temporarily slimming IQ down to a three-piece before \r\nNicholls decision to re-join in 1992. Former It Bites bassist John Jowitt would eventually \r\ncomplete the newly re-branded line-up, and after signing up with the newly established \r\nindependent label Giant Electric Pea the band entered Manchester's Parkland studio's to \r\nrecord what was in effect a follow-up to their seminal 1985 release 'The Wake', the band \r\neschewing the slick commercialism of the previous two albums produced under the IQ \r\nbanner in favour of reviving their original, Genesis-inspired, un-ashamedly prog-rock style \r\nthat had garnered the band a large-and-loyal cult following at the beginning of the 1980's. \r\nFollowing-up 'The Wake' was always going to be a stiff challenge but 'Ever' showed that IQ \r\nwere, happily, still the formidable and highly inventive band of yesterday, the intervening \r\neight-year gap doing nothing to diminish the group's complex musical ideologies. Song \r\nsuch as the multi-layered opener 'The Darkest Hour' and it's epic, two-art follow-up 'Fading \r\nSenses' reveal a band on top-notch form, adding steelier guitars and up-tempo beats to \r\ntheir established keyboard-heavy formula. However, whilst 'Ever' did prove to be a \r\ntriumphant return-to-form for IQ, it can also be see as possibly their most imporant album \r\nto date, both re-invogorating a band who, to many, seem finished, and providing an \r\nimportant stepping-stone onto the next level of their career, enabling the group to develop \r\ntheir sound and therefore produce albums such as the 100-minute-plus, 1998 double-\r\nalbum 'Subterranea', the darkly-hued 2005 release 'Dark Matter' and their highly-praised \r\nlatest effort 'Frequency', stretching IQ's burgeoning career upto the thirty-year mark. \r\nMusically, 'Ever' doesn't quite hit the same peaks as it's prog-styled predecessors, with the \r\nlatter-half of the album displaying a slightly soft, pop-inspired lilt, but there can be no \r\nunderestimating the importance of the album's timing. 1993 was a time when grunge \r\nbands such as Nirvana and Soundgarden ruled the musical roost, and the band's such as \r\nIQ were at the very margins, strugling to gain a foothold in the music industry. 'Ever' allowed \r\nIQ the time and space to carefully plan their career and as a result they have given us a \r\nplethora of excellent albums and become one of modern prog's top acts. 'Ever' is by no \r\nmeans their greatest achievement, but it''s one of their most important.\r\nSTEFAN TURNER, LONDON, 2010 </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=291896#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=291896\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=291896\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, July 25, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #291896)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=123\"><strong>Easy Livin</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator / Retired Admin</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=123\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/EasyLivin/8FDAD_TAAB.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Intelligent</strong><p>Having been absent from the line up since 1985, during which time IQ recorded 2 further \r\nalbums, original vocalist Peter Nicholls returned to the fold for this the band's fifth album. \r\nBassist Tim Essau left the band along with Paul Menel, Tim's place being taken by John \r\nJowitt, whose tenure in the band has only recently ended. While these line up changes are \r\nof course significant, the far more important news is that with \"Ever\" IQ ditched their \r\naspirations for commercial success, reverting instead to the fine neo-prog of their early \r\ndays.<p>The opening \"The Darkest Hour\" is one of the finest pieces the band have recorded. \r\nPerformed at a regal pace, the track boasts great mellotron like synth, fine vocals and a first \r\nclass arrangement. Mike Holmes guitar sound is more Hackett like than ever, but while the \r\nGenesis influences are still apparent, this really is neo-prog defined.<p>There is a touch of irony to \"Fading Senses\", one of the shorter tracks at around 6 minutes, \r\nas it is the only track to have sub-sections.  The two sections are however quite noticeable \r\nin an \"All good people\" sort of way (although there is otherwise no similarity). Retaining the \r\nregal tempo, the latter (title) section is primarily an appealing instrumental. While the track \r\nsegues into the following \"Out Of Nowhere\", the complex \"Apocalypse in 7/8ths\" like intro \r\nsignifies a heavier, more rock orientated number. <p>If \"Out of nowhere\" represents the edge of the spectrum of the album on the commercial \r\nside, its diagonal opposite is the following 14\u00bd minute \"Further Away\". To describe this \r\npiece as a typical IQ classic is simultaneously inadequate but accurate. Centred a similar \r\ndrum pattern to that mentioned above, the track boasts all the tenets of a first rate neo-prog \r\nnumber. <p>After an epic piece like \"Further away\", it makes sense to move to a more gentle mood, \r\nand \"Leap Of Faith\" does just that. Here the emphasis is on a particularly strong melody \r\nwhich Nicholls delivers superbly. The track would have fitted in well on \"A trick of the tail\", it \r\nis that sort of soft-prog. The seamless segue into \"Came Down\" is very much in keeping \r\nwith the way \"Afterglow\" is reached, and indeed \"Came down\" is admirably \"Afterglow\" like. <p>In all, one of the best IQ albums of their entire career. On a par with \"Dark matter\", \"Ever\" \r\nrepresents all the tenets which make for a great neo-prog album.

As well as Tim Esau and Paul Menel taking their leave of the band, the \r\nremaining group members were rocked by a series of deaths of people close to them - \r\nincluding Les \"Ledge\" Marshall, the long-time friend of the band and bassist who momentarily \r\nreplaced Tim, and former Twelfth Night frontman Geoff Mann, whose untimely demise was a \r\nshock to all the members of the extended neo-prog family who emerged from London's \r\nMarquee club in the early 1980s.<p>John Jowitt stepped into the breach to take on bass, whilst Peter Nicholls was so moved by the \r\nevents that had occurred that he readily agreed to return to the vacant vocalist spot. All five \r\nperformers were determined to save the band in honour of Ledge's memory, and as the new \r\nalbum took form the commercial musical direction taken with the two Paul Menel albums was \r\ncomprehensively abandoned. It's quite fitting, in fact, that Ever seems to pick up IQ's more \r\ncomplex neo-prog style right where The Wake left off - because whilst The Wake was a concept \r\nalbum about death from the point of view of someone who has died, Ever tackles very similar \r\nsubject matter from the point of view of those who are left behind.<p>This evolution from narrative fantasy about the afterlife to contemplative musing about \r\nbereavement shows a maturing in the band's lyrical focus, and it's accompanied by a maturing \r\nin their sound. It isn't as gloomy an album as it might have been by any stretch of the \r\nimagination - it has its sad and subdued moments, as the subject matter demands, but there's \r\nalso peace, tranquility, joy, excitement, and a sniff of nostalgia; in other words, all the best \r\nemotions you might feel when recalling happy times that cannot be reclaimed (due to death, \r\ndistance, or any other reason) but which seem as vivid as though they were yesterday. It's one \r\nof the most incredible comeback albums I've ever heard.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=611384#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=611384\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=611384\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, January 17, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #611384)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12334\"><strong>b_olariu</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12334\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12334/4927969.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIQ never sounded better before this album, maybe only on The wake that for sure. Released in 1993\r\nand named Ever, this album must be seen as one ofthe best neo prog albums of the 90s. A return to\r\nform after unintresting and almost comercial Are You Sitting Comfortably? and Nomzamo from the late\r\n80s. Ever is really a very good album full of intresting passages and warm vocal lines. Every\r\nmusician shines here, Nichols is back behind the mic after some years spended outside IQ and he done\r\none of the best vocal arrangements he ever done on an IQ album. Opening with elegant and yet complex\r\nmid paced piece The Darkest Hour, I guess one of the best pieces IQ ever recorded, with amazing\r\nmusicianship nad top notch ideas, the drums , the guitar the keyboards are simply perfect - complex\r\nneo prog of the highest calibre. The rest of the pieces goes this way, all are winners here, the\r\nlongest track Further Away is another top notch track. All in all a very worthy album of a band that\r\nin the late '80s seamns to lost his identity, but founded gain after 3-4 years with this album.\r\nAfter Ever IQ climb higher and higher with each album, and I don;t think they got weak album from\r\nthis one on, all are top notch including the The wake from previous era of the band.

It is the radiant beauty and jagged edges that \r\nremind me of their music. The band revel in complex time changes and a heavy emphasis on virtuosic \r\ninstrumentation. The vocals on this are wonderful from the same vocalist of IQ's \"The Wake\" which was \r\na mere sign of the master quality of \"Ever\". The lead guitar expertise of Mike Holmes is always a delight, \r\nas are the wondrous keyboards of Martin Orford.<p>It begins with the epic sounds of 'The Darkest Hour' that has a delightful melody and very powerful \r\nguitars. The lead break at 5 and a half minutes in is excellent and it is followed by ribbons of synths. \r\nThis interlude is neo prog at its best, and in fact the entire song is one of IQ's finest compositions. The \r\nlyrics are transfixing; \"out of the way of anyone, wilder than you are, anyone who ever had a heart, \r\nwouldn't deny me, woe betied the one not to be undone, who will remember, start it again when does it \r\nend, I'm in there somewhere, nobody can carry me over.\" The lead guitar solo follows and it culminates \r\nin a tranquil passage of ambience. The piano, guitar and synth pads generate a peaceful backdrop to \r\nNicholl's final thoughts; \"if I should fall from your side, keep it in your mind, how I tried to keep it here, \r\nhow I promised you'd be safe, and you never said a word, and you never cried.\" One of the best IQ \r\ntracks in their long tenure in the neo prog scene.<p>After this glorious opening the next track is 'Fading Senses', that is in two sections, i. After All, ii. \r\nFading Senses. This one has quiet, relaxing synths and vocals. It builds to a heavier beat and lead \r\nguitar solos that are very emotionally charged, and a time sig shift is augmented by heavier sounds, that \r\nmerge seamlessly back to a spacey synth. The musicianship is mesmirising throughout and as good \r\nas it gets for prog in the early 90s, when prog was beginning to make a comeback. This is one of the \r\nbest IQ tracks in their quitter repertoire.   \r\n <p>'Out Of Nowhere' comes in with a syncopated guitar and drum rhythm, sounding like Genesis for a time. \r\nThe distorted guitar riff chugs moderately as Nicholl's crystal clear vocals speak of not giving in to \r\ndoubt; \"some are born into their lives, with a need to be destroyed, it's the wrong thing on my mind, the \r\nonly thing we can't survive.\" I love this song with its melodic upbeat style, and Nicholl's inimitable \r\nvocals. It has a more straight forward commercial sound but it works well enough as a melodic break \r\nfrom the complexity previously. \r\n <p>'Further Away' is another lengthy track at 14:30, and begins with Marillion-style chiming synths that \r\nlock into a motif layer for the flute to float on. The vocals are lower register and very relaxed; \"torn from \r\nmy hand so heavy now you're a world away, these little lies are grown so cold and will I see you when I \r\nturn around.\" The flute embellishments are gorgeous, adding a haunting beauty. The heavier guitars and \r\nodd rhythms are strong and drive the track along on its journey. Along the way there are scintillating \r\nkeyboard solos, spacey synthscapes and lead guitar solos emotionally pouring out like golden honey. \r\n  <p>'Leap Of Faith' follows with passages of tranquillity leading to glorious synth and lead guitar trade offs. It \r\nsegues directly into 'Came Down', with a steady beat and lead guitar melodies. The vocals are \r\nmelancholy and subdued; \"all the time we didn't share, when we set adrift half forgotten lies, will the \r\nmadness still be there, when you turn away, the distance in your eyes speaks the words that you won't \r\nsay.\" The verses lead to an uplifting chorus with harmonies and the distinct feeling the album is drawing \r\nto a close. The final instrumentation gives us one more chance to hear Holmes' lead soling, simply \r\nstunning in its execution.  <p>\"Ever\" is a masterful symphonically-driven album, creatively rich and infused with soulful passion and \r\ndramatic energy. After 8 years absence from the band, Peter Nicholls returns and injects a refreshed \r\nenthusiasm and vibrancy to the band's sound. Every track is delightful featuring some of the best neo-\r\nprog I have had the pleasure to hear. It is an absolute joy to listen to a band that does not shy away \r\nfrom complex musicianship and keeps everything upbeat and positive. At the end of the album I feel \r\nrefreshed and I know I have heard something very, very special indeed. The album comes with a plethora \r\nof rave reviews, and has enthused lovers of prog over the years who hail it as a masterpiece. Often these \r\nalbums are overhyped and do not live up to expectations but in this case, the hype is well deserved. \r\n\"Ever\" is a bonafide masterpiece and is one of the reasons the band are so well known and have \r\ngarnered a massive following. With music this good, it is impossible to ignore IQ, and this album is one \r\nof the treasures of 1993, and indeed the 90s decade itself.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=794979#social-comments\"

\r\nPaul Menel left the band due to musical differences and were replaced by past singer Peter \r\nNicholls (after his unsuccesful attempt with Niadem's Ghost) and bassist Les \r\nMarshall.However tragedy would struck shortly after, when Marshall died suddenly.This hard \r\nexperience brought the IQ members closer, forming their own label Giant Electric Pea and \r\nreleasing the live /rarities CD '' J'ai Pollette d'Arnu'' in 1991.With ex-Ark bassist John Jowitt \r\njoining IQ, the band performed several concerts (among them a virgin gig at 93' Progfest) and \r\nreturned with the fifth studio album ''Ever'' the same year.<p>The new album marked a new start for IQ, which would return to more progressive \r\narrangements, eventually leaving their ultra GENESIS-influenced style of their debut in the past \r\nand borrowing the best elements from the artistic sound of their poppier releases.The result is \r\na work full of grandieur, haunting atmospheres, powerful grooves and intense lyricism.And \r\nwhile ''Ever'' is a bit inferior compared to the band's first couple of albums, it is definitely a very \r\nstrong and intricate album.Jowitt's presence brought the great rhythmic bass lines the band \r\nwas rather lacking and the sound of IQ is well-balanced between memorable grooves and \r\nkeyboard-based arrangements with Orford's synths on the forefront.Menel was a great singer, \r\nbut Nicholls will always be the trademark voice of IQ with his theatrical and sensitive vocal \r\nlines.The overall sound holds resemblences with ''The wake'' release, deep, atmospheric and \r\nenjoyable Neo Prog with dominant keyboard parts, careful lead and solo guitar parts and plenty \r\nof room for some instrumental ideas.The later are among the album's highlights, offering \r\nsome really exciting moments of unforgettable soundscapes.<p>While ''Ever'' still has some black holes of mediocre musicianship by a band trying to make a \r\nreally succesful comeback, for the most of its length this is an album with major enjoyable Neo \r\nProg-ish material, played with passion.Strongly recommended, no surprise for another nice IQ \r\nalbum...3.5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=802695#social-comments\"

/>\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nEver marked the (glorious) return to IQ of original vocalist, the exceptional Peter Nicholls, and also the debut album with classy \r\nbassist John Jowitt (who has, sadly, recently departed).<p>If is, therefore, something of a fresh beginning for the band, almost a sort of second debut, if you will. And what a fresh start it is. \r\nRight from the opening pomp bars, and the moment Nicholls enters the fray on the incredible The Darkest Hour, there is an energy \r\nand a frisson on this album which makes one sit up and take notice immediately. Of course, back in 1993, we old fans lapped it up \r\nfollowing the relative disappointments of the preceding two albums without our hero. Perhaps more than on any other album, you \r\nget the absolute full range of his vocal talents, from the deliciously fragile, to the out and out rock star.<p>Ever also marked the album where the band abandoned any pretence of seeking grand commercial success. Ever is a Progressive \r\nRock album pure and simple, with no hostage to commercial fortune whatsoever. Having said this, it is the case that only a band \r\nwhich grew up and learnt its craft in those heady days in the 1980's could possibly come up with something as markedly contrasting \r\nas Fading Senses. Only six and a half minutes long, it has two distinct sections. The first, After All is gentle and almost floating, \r\nwhilst the eponymous second section is an altogether darker affair, marked out by a thumping rhythm section backing swirling, dark, \r\nOrford synths and Holmes riffs. The temptation on this must have been to turn it into one of those lengthy epics, but I am glad they \r\ndidn't, because there is more packed into this than in many twenty minutes epics. You could also, of course, make a reasonably \r\nintelligent argument that the old style rocker Out Of Nowhere, in a different era, would have been a contender for the singles chart. \r\nNot in 1993, though.<p>The highlight of the album is the longest track, Further Away, at some fourteen and a half minutes. It represents all that is good \r\nabout IQ, namely some incredible changes in tempo and mood. Some of Orford's passages, especially, are as dark and gothic as \r\nthe great man ever put to record, whereas other passages put you more in mind of clear summer days, with Nicholls at his fragile \r\nbest. Perhaps, though, the last comment on this byword for quality should be the staggering guitar performance of Mike Holmes, \r\nwho reflects these moods perfectly, from gentle acoustic, to sharp, harsh, riffs, to gloriously uplifting sequences that sing above all \r\nelse to lead us into the denouement.<p>Following this treat for ears and brain, the boys take us into altogether more gentle, and straightforward, territory with the shorter \r\nclosing tracks, Leap of Faith and Came Down, both of which are hugely enjoyable, more \"traditional\" tracks. I love the manner in \r\nwhich the former gently segues into the latter with a gorgeous, lilting Holmes guitar passage.<p>Ever marked the commencement of an incredibly high quality run of albums by IQ. I do not think it is their best - they, in my opinion, \r\nare Subterranea and Dark Matter, but this is very close to those ridiculously high standards.<p>This is the sound of a united and determined band, and one that would continue to produce some of the highest quality prog rock. \r\nFour stars for this. Quite excellent, and worth buying for the sound of Mike Holmes at his very best alone, whose beauty takes us \r\nfading out of the album.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1157569#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1157569\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1157569\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, April 5, 2014</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1157569)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAnd then like a waking up from a bad dream, IQ emerged from a tumultuous and heartbreaking period. First there were the two \r\nalbums with P. L. Menel as vocalist where the band steered towards a more commercial sounding blandness but secondly and most \r\nimportant was a series of deaths of band members' friends and family. Not only did they lose their bassist Les Marshall a few years \r\nback but both guitarist Mike Holmes and Peter Nicholls would lose their fathers as well as their good friend Georf Mann who was \r\ntaken out by cancer. After all this turmoil IQ reconvened along with original vocalist Peter Nicholls and not only rediscovered their \r\noriginal musical prowess that should have continued after \"The Wake,\" but with their sixth studio album EVER initiated a new \r\ncreative period that would continue up to the present. While such missteps and events can easily destroy a band's trajectory, IQ \r\nproved they were up to the challenge of channeling all of the negativity and constructing a new reality.<p>As with such tragedy and unfortunate events that change our realities, the members of IQ expressed their grief through their music. \r\nIn addition to going back to their original goals of creating captivating neo-prog music, Peter Nicholls was back on vocals and John \r\nJowitt would replace Tim Esau on bass. All this change and lament resulted in a therapy session via musical expression and while the \r\nuniverse may have taken away, it also rewarded with a refreshed and inspired direction for the band to take and one that they have \r\nnot strayed from ever since. Faced with all this melancholy the band channeled their energies into their renaissance album that \r\ndisplays all their early confidence and deftly crafted a beautiful album that deals with the loss of friends and family and of the \r\ninsecurities we all face with the fleeting impermanence of life.<p>With brilliantly delivered lyrical content that is strongly poetic and an excellent production to boot, each band member shines like a \r\nray of sun through a darkened catacomb offering a glimmer of hope in the cold and brutal world. From the first energetic burst of \r\nenergy as \"The Darkest Hour\" initiates the album's overall melancholy, we are treated to extraordinarily strong musical material with \r\nPaul Cook stepping up his drumming skills, Mike Holmes creating soaring guitar licks and Martin Orford icing the cake with his \r\natmospheric keyboard magic as well as taking the liberty to show off some virtuosity in the mix. John Jowitt's bass playing skills are \r\nthe perfect rhythmic and melodic complement to the other musicians and Nicholls proves he was the man who meant to deliver the \r\nvocals with a renewed sense of self-assurance. While there are no weak tracks on EVER, some are stronger than others. The 14 and a \r\nhalf minute prog workout \"Further Away\" takes the listener to another world with strong melodies and developments that run the \r\ngamut of the neo-prog universe with perfect execution. <p>While few bands recover from the major tumble IQ undertook with two unpopular albums and a series of personal cataclysms, not \r\nonly did Orford and company pull themselves together with dignity but in the process not only revived their own musical career but \r\nalso contributed to awakening the entire sleeping prog universe in the early 90s when a new wave of progressive rock was slowly \r\ncrawling from its sleeping chambers and proving that it still had not just a pulse left but enough vitality to make a full blown \r\ncomeback after lurking in the darkness for the previous decade. Yes, the nightmare had ended and EVER would become one of the \r\nmost successful comeback albums in the prog universe and would turn the page and start a new chapter in its history.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1598953#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1598953\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1598953\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, August 19, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=615#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1598953)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=18054\"><strong>BrufordFreak</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=18054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/18054/TheShrike.jpeg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nLike a lot of 1990s Neo Prog, IQ's antiquated synths tinge the band's musical contributions from the middle half of their 40 years. Even then, I used to cringe at some of those \"inaccurate\" sounds generated by the sampling technologies available from the 1980s (which happened quite a lot, actually, as my brother is a collector of keyboards and computer sound-generators. Nothing like the 70s synths.) The imitation of classical and world instruments via computer has never been a very advanced science--which is probably why so many bands have reverted to hiring strings, choruses, and orchestras to accompany/embellish their music fantasies. The 90s Neo Prog band keys sound like fairy music.<p>1. \"The Darkest Hour\" (10:52) (16.25/20)\r\n2. \"Fading Senses\" (6:36) (8.5/10)\r\n- i. After All\r\n- ii. Fading Senses\r\n3. \"Out Of Nowhere\" (5:10) a fast start into GENESIS-land is delayed and switched to standard hairband rock at the one minute mark. Nice coda at the 3:00 mark. (8.5/10)\r\n4. \"Further Away\" (14:30) a very good prog epic. This one almost makes the album worth owning. (27/30) \r\n5. \"Leap Of Faith\" (7:22) The instrumental parts become so Genesisian. Aside from the vocals, the best track on the song. (13.5/15)\r\n6. \"Came Down\" (5:57) again, the opening sound and chord palette feels too Genesis-like.

It features the return of their former vocalist \r\nPeter Nicholls to the line up of the group. After the release of the two first studio albums \"Tales From The Lush \r\nAttic\" in 1983 and \"The Wake\" in 1985, Peter Nicholls left the band. He was substituted by Paul Menel that \r\nparticipated on the two next studio albums of the band \"Nomzamo\" in 1987 and \"Are You Sitting Comfortably?\" \r\nin 1989. \"Ever\" was also their first album with the participation of John Jowitt as their new bass player, who \r\nsubstituted their former bassist Tim Essau. So, it was interesting to see how the musical direction of the band \r\nwas after the last two disappointing albums.<p>So, the line up on the album is Peter Nicholls (lead and backing vocals), Mike Holmes (guitars), Martin Orford \r\n(backing vocals, flute and keyboards), John Jowitt (backing vocals and bass guitar) and Paul Cook (drums and \r\npercussion).<p>\"Ever\" has six tracks. All songs were written by IQ and all lyrics were written by Peter Nicholls. The first track \"The \r\nDarkest Hour\" is a song that starts with nice guitar and keyboard works. It's a song settled into a steady paced \r\nrhythm and with a very pleasant and catchy melody. The melody is peaceful, alternating with mysterious and \r\ncalm passages. All over the song there are some nice musical textures that change throughout the song. It's a \r\nvery dark and moody song with catchy lyrics. This is, without any doubt, a great song with all the ingredients that \r\nall IQ fans love, including some reminiscences of Genesis. This is a great track to open the album. The second \r\ntrack \"Fading Senses\" is divided into two parts, \"After All\" and \"Fading Senses\". This is a very simple and beautiful \r\nsong where the voice of Peter sounds a little bit sad as if he was alone. In my humble opinion, this is also a song \r\nwith a slight touch of irony. This is basically a song divided into two different moments. In the beginning, it's a \r\nmellow song dominated by keyboards and vocals but after, about three minutes, it change its mood with heavy \r\nguitars and pounding drums taking count of it with the sound of the synthesizers coming and going. The third \r\ntrack \"Out Of Nowhere\" brings the music back into another upbeat tempo and high energy combining the work \r\nof keyboards, bass and drums nicely. It's a very strong and heavier song, a more rock oriented number, with nice \r\nguitar riffs played under Nicholls vocals. This is a song, without any doubt, with a more straight forward \r\ncommercial sound. However, and despite is my less favourite track on the album, I still like this song with its \r\nmelodic upbeat style and the unmistakable voice of Peter. Besides, I think that it works very well on the album. \r\nThe fourth track \"Further Away\" represents the second great epic on the album with \"The Darkest Hour\". This is a \r\nreal masterpiece of the band. It's a very powerful track in terms of musical composition with multi-part musical \r\nstructures and many tempo changes. The first three minutes are very melodic with some very harmonious \r\nsounds, but at the end of it the music changes to a heavier mode with a powerful soft guitar work and a very \r\ndynamic bass line. The track progresses with a more complex musical structure and an incredible sonic quality. \r\nThe track ends with another mellow part and with a great keyboard work. The fifth track \"Leap Of Faith\" is a very \r\nbeautiful track with musical passages of tranquillity leading by a magnificent synthesizer and guitar works. This \r\nis a very melodic track that reminds me strongly Genesis in the era of Steve Hackett, especially \"Afterglow\" of \r\n\"Wind And Wuthering\". It's a track with all the ingredients of truly a classic progressive track and it explains way \r\nIQ is considered, probably, the band of all neo-prog bands that carries better the spirit of the symphonic classic \r\nera, especially the spirit of Genesis' music. This is one of my favourite tracks on the album. The sixth and last \r\ntrack \"Came Down\" is a very calm and peaceful track that closes the album magnificently. We even can say that \r\n\"Leap Of Faith\" and \"Came Down\" are somehow melded together to make up another long and great track. \r\nSome of the best Peter's vocals are on these two tracks. These are, in reality, two great songs. We also can say \r\nthat on these two tracks there is a grandeur that hasn't been so sincerely heard before and felt since Hackett left \r\nGenesis. It's, without any doubt, the perfect way to close this magnificent album.<p>Conclusion: Finally, I started reviewing albums of IQ. For unknown reasons, that surprised even me. Only now \r\nafter hundreds reviews that I wrote to Progarchives, I began to review one of my favourite bands. Anyway, as we \r\nusually say, it's better late than never. By the other hand, I decided to begin with \"Ever\" because I think \"Ever\" is a \r\nlandmark in IQ discography. It became as a turning point into their music. It's one of their best musical works \r\nand it begins also the base of their best line up, for me. If you love symphonic progressive rock music with a \r\ncatchy melody and a moderate complexity in musical composition, IQ, and particularly \"Ever\", is a good starting \r\npoint. By the other hand, if you love, like me, the classic era of the progressive rock, especially Genesis and Yes, \r\nI'm sure that you will not be disappointed with \"Ever\", even for a minute. So, \"Ever\" is a must have for everyone \r\nwho loves symphonic and prog rock in general.<p>Prog is my Ferrari.
