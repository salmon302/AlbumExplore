They were not really bad,\r\nok,  but for a band that sparkled such a revolution in the music scene in the 80\u00c2\u00b4s with such iconic\r\nand classic stuff like The Number Of The Beast and Iron Maiden, their 2000 CDs sounded more or less\r\nthe same: overlong, lacking their famous energy, repetitive. In other words, not up to what they\r\nused to do so easily before. Well, I\u00c2\u00b4m glad to say that finally they seem to have come up with a\r\ncollection of songs that not only live up to their glorious past, but also deliver them with a kind\r\nof gut and energy rarely seen (or heard) from them for many, many years. In fact, The Book Of Souls\r\nis certainly their best since Fear Of The Dark <p>Their new CD sounds to me like a incredible rebirth of sorts; from the opener If Eternity Should\r\nFail, we are presented with a  song that sounds familiar, yet bringing new prog elements to their\r\ntrademark heavy metal sound: atmospheric keys give introduction to the magical twin guitar leads\r\ntheir were famous for while Steve Harris bass is pumping great lines again together with Nicko\r\nMcBrain\u00c2\u00b4s drums. Then Bruce Dickinson comes in with gusto and his voice is in top form. It\u00c2\u00b4s been a\r\n long time since I listened to such vigorous and inspired guitar solos from them. sudden tempo\r\nchanges, varying rhythms and tasteful power chords abound. It reminded me of the times when IM could\r\ndo no wrong and every note seemed to fall evenly on every spot. It is also ok that there is few\r\nnovelties apart from the massive Empire Of The Clouds (see more below). <p>Certainly the album is not perfect: the shorter songs are not as powerful as the long ones, yet none\r\nis weak either. The first single, Speed Of Light, is probably the link between their latest\r\noffering, The Final Frontier and their new found return to form. But it is also just that a small\r\nclue, since the band has a lot more to offer and in at least two moments they truly were able to\r\nproduce another Iron Maiden classics in the form of the epics The Red And Black and Empire Of\r\nClouds. The former is a 13 minute piece that pretty much sums up the best the band had to show up\r\ntill some years ago, meaning that it has all Iron Maiden traits and clich\u00c3\u00a9s, yet it sounds fresh and\r\nexciting. The latter however, is really the piece of resistance of the whole CD: an 18 minute opus\r\nwhere the band boldly goes where they never have been before. A truly prog metal epic, it starts\r\nwith an acoustic piano and violin (!), then slowly building up to several parts that takes to a\r\ngreat ride where all the band members shine until the grand finale. That track alone is worth the\r\nprice of the CD. <p>It\u00c2\u00b4s amazing how energetic ant tight the band sounds after all these years. The songwriting is again\r\ntop notch, varied and creative, helped by a very organic production and stunning performances. Not a\r\ndull moment in the whole album. And that\u00c2\u00b4s a lot to say for a double CD with over 90 minutes of music!<p>Conclusion; it is so nice to see a classic band finding their muse again. Iron Maiden seems to\r\nfinally merged seamlessly their early 80\u00c2\u00b4s energy with the more complex, progressive streak of latter days. <p>I wish all classic bands around could rejuvenate like this. <p>Rating: compared to their masterpieces of the 80\u00c2\u00b4s The Book Of Souls is a  four star affair.\r\nHowever, nowadays itis just too good astonishing work to deserve less than 5. Highly recommended! <p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1460004#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1460004\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1460004\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, September 6, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1460004)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11631\"><strong>Windhawk</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=11631\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/11631/lpvet2.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nUK band IRON MAIDEN is a group of musicians that hardly needs an introduction. With a history going\r\nback to 1975 and with a grand total of 16 studio albums to their name, of which the greater majority\r\nwill be regarded as essential listening by anyone with a taste for metal, this is arguably one of\r\nthe greatest metal bands in the world still, a brand name strong enough to be recognized even by the\r\ngreater majority of people who have never listened to the band. \"The Book of Souls\" is their most\r\nrecent studio album at the time of writing, and was released in September 2015 through UK label\r\nParlophone.<p>This is a production that have been highly anticipated by the metal community in general and Iron\r\nMaiden fans in particular. Five years have gone since their latest studio album, and as Iron Maiden\r\nhave been on strong form ever since vocalist Bruce Dickinson returned to the band back in 2000,\r\nthere has been a demand for new material by them, even in these days of declining sales and a\r\nlessened emotional attachment to music in general. That the band members have heralded this album as\r\ntheir possibly best ever is to be expected, most artists will state such opinions when they release\r\nnew material, but the manner in which the members have talked about the almost 20 minutes long\r\nconcluding epic have been creating quite the buzz, as well as the fact that this is the band's first\r\never double studio production.<p>Personally I have found most Iron Maiden albums to be something of a roller-coaster ride, with\r\nexceptional songs, good songs and passable songs making out their albums, with a few filers tossed\r\nin on occasion. I have much the same impression about this production, not quite as good as the band\r\nhave been when firing on all cylinders, but just as strong as the greater majority of the albums\r\nthey released back in the classic NWoBHM era.<p>The opening trio of If Eternity Should Fail, Speed of Light and The Great Unknown didn't entice me\r\nall that much. Pleasant Iron Maiden creations exploring their atmospheric laden, pace-filled and\r\nmajestic territories respectively, with my main impression being that too much relies on enjoying\r\nDickinson's vocals on these songs with too little substance and nuance provided by the\r\ninstrumentalists. As always with splendid guitar solo runs though, and those truly fond of that\r\naspect of Iron Maiden will find these songs as well as this album as a whole to be a splendid ride\r\nthrough and through I imagine.<p>The Red and the Black marks the first high point for me, a classic \"...Mariner\" epic with a nifty\r\nrecurring riff motif looking back at the band's sound from the early 80's as an additional treat,\r\nand with a recurring vocal details that is bound to be a future concert favorite. A track that have\r\nall the trademarks of becoming a staple in their live set until the band at some point decides to\r\ncall it quits. The following When the River Runs Deep is for me the low point of this production\r\nhowever, a composition that for me doesn't have anything much memorable apart from a nice guitar\r\nsolo run, something Iron Maiden appears to be capable of producing in their sleep.<p>Title track The Book of Souls is for me the standout piece of the album, with powerful riff driven\r\nsequences, a spectacular and subtly exotic sounding guitars and keyboards arrangement in the opening\r\nhalf that is goosebumps-inducing, a nice run of compelling guitar solo and riff sequences, with a\r\nfrail guitar motif opening and ending this magical ride.<p>From here on and until the end I find the songs to be generally enjoyable and of a high but not\r\nmagnificent quality. Death or Glory is a nice run through a compelling energetic sound with a strong\r\nchorus as the icing on the cake. Shadows of the Valley have some direct references back to classic\r\ntracks from the \"Somewhere in Time\" album musically, lyrically and in terms of quality to in my\r\nopinion, while Tears of a Clown and The man of Sorrows both see Iron Maiden exploring their sound\r\nwith more of a poignant and mournful tinge, much due to the topics covered in those compositions I\r\nsuspect. The former of them with slightly more of a toned down instrument  arrangement, the latter\r\ninitially with a ballad-tinged expression and then unfolding as a mid-paced affair that wouldn't\r\nhave been out of place on an album like \"Sevent Son...\".<p>The massive Empire of the Clouds is an impressive piece of work. Dealing with a subject matter\r\npresumably close to the heart of singer Dickinson, as he is a pilot as well as an admirer of\r\nairships: He has actually invested in firms working towards relaunching airships as a viable\r\nalternative to commercial transportation of people and freight alike. The opening third of this epic\r\nconstruction is one filled with gentle piano movements, violin details, orchestration, plucked\r\nguitars and occasional marching drums besides the lead vocals, and as some key members of Iron\r\nMaiden are fans of progressive rock I suspect the numerous subtle instrument details with more than\r\na subtle trace of Jethro Tull in them in tone or delivery is an accidental feature either. This\r\nunfolds into a majestic epic where orchestration and piano details supplements the key Iron Maiden\r\nsound quite nicely throughout, in some passages as constants and in others as more subtle or\r\noccasional flavoring, briefly returning to the gentler opening themes again prior to the conclusion.\r\nThoroughly entertaining and extremely well made, but not quite at the level of Iron Maiden at their\r\nmost breathtaking my personal opinion.<p>In sum this is a recommended purchase. If you are a fan already I guess you'll have bought this one\r\nalready, if you haven't this is an album worth buying. Probably not a production that will be\r\nregarded as their finest moment in retrospect, but at least for me this is a production comparable\r\nin quality with the classic Iron Maiden albums of the 1980's. And if there are people out there who\r\nhaven't yet heard the music of Iron Maiden, this CD is as good a starting point as anything else.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1460100#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1460100\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1460100\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, September 6, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1460100)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden - The Book of Souls (2015)<p>The Beatles of heavy metal return with double cd that will surely please fans, but will leave others thinking if the \r\nband isn't becoming TOO Iron Maiden. Longer tracks, more lead themes, more lyrics, more mandatory solo's \r\n(you'd better still love Adrian Smith's smoosh smoosh lead guitar) and more of the same Brave New World sound \r\nproduction by Kevin Shirley - who is perhaps heavy metal's greatest plague of the 21th century. Every album until \r\neven 'X-Factor' (which I recently started listening to again) except for the troubled 'No Prayer For The Dying' had \r\nhad its own specific sound and atmosphere, but in the 21 century all five Maiden albums have sounded alike and \r\ntherefor a bit flat. To me this album again sounds like a great amount of musical power pushed into a tiny tin can. \r\nFurthermore, Kevin Shirley has managed to make the band sound a bit amateurish and unsteady. <p>But let us not only focus on the production. This is after all still an Iron Maiden record! By now the band is totally \r\nimmersed in its own universe of songwriting as if it were a genre. To compensate we find an openingsection of 'If \r\nEternity Should Fail' with eighties keyboards and some acoustic guitar, some spanish bass-chords on 'The Red \r\nand the Black' and the surprising use of piano an cello on the eighteen minute 'Empire of the Clouds'. In interviews \r\nthe band has described the writing process as working with 'baskets of ideas' put into songs in the studio with the \r\nband playing in a live-in-the-studio setting. Both band and producer are happy with this approach. Sometimes it \r\nseems to work but the band has totally left the idea of writing a good song. You know, that tight unit in which every \r\nelement has a part to play and where the guitar solo fired us up for something. To me a lot of material in these \r\ntracks sounds mandatory, like the often lifeless solo's and the endless twin leadguitar themes. This doesn't stop \r\nsome refrains from being very catchy and some themes like the symphonic part in 'The Red and the Black' being \r\nexciting, but in the end it comes across as a bit unthoughtfull and unfinished.  <p>Don't get me wrong. I would still love to have a favorite 21th century Iron Maiden album but the band will have to \r\nstart writing songs again and play them for a while before recording them - with a proper producer. Motorhead, \r\nJudas Priest and many others have sounded great the past ten years, so can Iron Maiden. Because of the lack \r\nprofessionalism I can't give more then three stars, though 'the buckets' had some nice ideas in them. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1468382#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1468382\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1468382\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, September 22, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1468382)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=40189\"><strong>FragileKings</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=40189\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/40189/marble.JPG\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI'll confess two things right off the top here: one is that I loved Iron Maiden in the early 1980's and the other is \r\nthat I didn't buy any of their albums after \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". I really enjoyed and still enjoy the \r\ndebut, \"Number of the Beast\", and \"Piece of Mind\". I don't have \"Powerslave\" anymore but I want to get it. It was \r\nmy second concert to go see and I still have the T-shirt. But \"Somewhere in Time\" didn't impress me and \r\n\"Seventh Son\" didn't do much for me either (though I have it on CD now and I think it's pretty darn brilliant). \r\nSome of my favourite songs are \"Revelations\" from \"Piece\", \"The Prisoner\" and the title track from \"Beast\", and \r\n\"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Remember Tomorrow\" from the debut. I think it was the synthesizers that began \r\nshowing up on every metal album after Van Halen's \"1984\" that bothered me. Well, okay, not the thrash and \r\nspeed metal bands, but those I had loved in '83/'84 were suddenly playing around with pop music \r\nsynthesizers, and it had been the guitars all along that had drawn me to metal.<p><p>Iron Maiden's history has been a trip of twists and turns since 1987. Adrian Smith left and then Bruce \r\nDickenson left. Then they both came back. I have only heard one song from the intervening years between \r\n\"Seventh Son\" and this latest release, \"Book of Souls\" and it was a live version of \"Fear of the Dark\". I had a \r\nticket to see Iron Maiden perform in Saitama, Japan on March 13th, 2011, but as the band was flying in from \r\nSouth Korea on that fateful Friday the 11th, the Great East Japan Earthquake struck. Ed Force One redirected \r\nto Nagoya where the band watched the news footage of the earthquake and ensuing tsunami disaster and \r\ndecided that this was no time to hold a concert because this was no time to celebrate or party. They cancelled \r\nthe show and have not been back to Japan since.<p><p>So the new album comes out, and I am not particularly thrilled. Just, \"Oh, Maiden have a new album. Hm.\" But \r\nthen I see the packaging: a hard cover book inside a slip case. The artwork looks intriguing and I think that I \r\nhave to have this. Hey, Iron Maiden should still be good, right?<p><p>Well, Iron Maiden sounds exactly as I expect them to. One reviewer said that this is the album that should have \r\nfollowed \"Seventh Son\" and for my ears I have to agree. As I said, I don't know what Maiden did between 1987 \r\nand 2015 but for all I can tell they simply hoped aboard a time machine and came over to 2015 after wrapping \r\nup the Seventh Son tour. Well, of course Janick Gers is on board, too, now and has been for rather a long time.\r\n<p><p>Yes, this sounds just like classic Iron Maiden, so much in fact that I couldn't help but notice the guitar sound \r\nhasn't hanged since the 80's. The riffs, the song structures, Dickenson's voice, just about everything sounds \r\nlike this is the next album after \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". In fact, as I listened to \"The Great Unknown\" I \r\nfound myself thinking to the middle part of the \"Seventh Son\" title track. The beginning of \"Shadows of the \r\nValley\" reminded me of \"Wasted Years\", and some of the long instrumental sections of some songs like \"The \r\nRed and the Black\" are very much like things you'd here on \"Piece of Mind\".<p><p>Hearing so much similarity to past glories makes me wonder if the band has evolved at all over the last 30 \r\nyears or are they still following the same formula? Then again, maybe they just went back to their classic \r\nformula because it was time. Didn't Deep Purple, Voivod, and Black Sabbath do the same on their recent \r\nreleases?<p><p>Well, there may be synthesizers on this album, too, but by now I have come to not only accept them in metal but \r\nactually enjoy hearing them in the right context. I'm glad for their use on this album. But seriously, the biggest \r\nthrill here so far has to be the epic historical number, \"Empire of the Clouds\". I had to read the Wiki article about \r\nthe R101 and I also read about how Dickeson had purchased at a charity auction a piano used by Jamie \r\nCullum and later used the instrument to compose \"Empire\". The song is quite beautifully structured and the \r\nstory well told, sticking to history while still sounding poetic as Dickenson said he wanted. The orchestra is a \r\ngreat touch as I always thought that Maiden's metal would work well with an orchestra or performed by an \r\norchestra. \"Empire of the Clouds\" is in my opinion a fantastic piece, but I do love most of the songs on the \r\ndouble album as I listen to them. Some instrumental sections go on for a while without introducing anything that \r\nhasn't already been done (\"The Red and the Black\" for example) while other songs like \"Tears of a Clown\" \r\ntamper with unusual time signatures. Iron Maiden is not prog metal in the way that Dream Theater or Opeth are, \r\nbut I have always appreciated the extended instrumental sections that aren't just guitar solo showcases. Also, \r\nMaiden didn't often drop many kick ass riffs as I always felt they went more for a classical type of riffing that \r\nrarely hits with a wallop and usually lays out a musical landscape with a warm and steady path to follow. But \r\nthey find space to deliver a few good 'uns here and there as on \"Speed of Light\" and \"When the River Runs \r\nDeep\".<p><p>I think the album sounds great. It's what I'd expect to hear from this band. I like the longer compositions and that \r\nthere is careful attention to each of the songs. For that I give this baby an easy four stars. But after 30 years I'd \r\nhave expected to hear something new, more than just piano and an orchestra. But on the other hand, it's great \r\nto hear Maiden sounding like Maiden. I'll get \"Powerslave\" on CD soon and I've got \"Brave New World\" on \r\nstandby to order, too.<p><p>Now when are they coming back to Japan? </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1472985#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1472985\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1472985\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 5, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1472985)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI had to look it up after a couple of listens as I felt this must be a concept album but apparently it's not, rather the theme of \"souls\" does \r\nappear on many of the songs. Even the album cover with Eddie looking like a Mayan relates to the souls of mankind. This was recorded in \r\nParis where they did the \"Brave New World\" record which was the last MAIDEN album I gave 5 stars to.  Considering i'm an IRON MAIDEN \r\nfanboy it did take me several listens to even enjoy what I was hearing. I still feel this double album is hit and miss but thankfully more hit \r\nfor my tastes. I'll list my top five tracks as I take a look at each song. <p> \"If Eternity Should Fail\" opens sounding like we're in the theater \r\nwatching a Western as almost spoken words join in. It sounds really good when the song kicks in after 1 1/2 minutes, I love the rhythm \r\nsection. The instrumental section after 5 minutes is amazing and it lasts about a minute. The song ends with words from the Harvester of \r\nSouls. \"Speed Of Light\" is okay, it's a five minute barn-burner and the chorus is repeated a lot like on the first track. These two opening \r\nsongs are good but not great in my opinion and they didn't help in me getting into this recording at first. \"The Great Unknown\" is a top \r\nfive song for me. I really like the intricate guitars and atmosphere to open as almost spoken vocals join in. It kicks in hard after 1 1/2 \r\nminutes. Nice! <p>\"The Red And The Black\" is another top five track. That classic galloping rhythm with those passionate vocals really impress \r\nme. Hey there's the vocal melodies as well that Bruce does so well. Killer track. \"When The River Runs Deep\" is another good one \r\nespecially the instrumental section. Some ripping guitar after 4 1/2 minutes. \"The Book Of Souls\" is another top five and the final tune on \r\ndisc one. This one is dark and nasty the way I like them. Again the instrumental section here kills starting before 6 minutes. <p> \"Death Or \r\nGlory\" opens disc two as a catchy uptempo track that cooks. \"Shadows Of The Valley\" is another top five that opens sounding like \r\n\"Wasted Years\" with that guitar intro. The drums and vocals join in and this is intense. I like the chorus and the guitar before 7 minutes. \r\n\"Tears Of A Clown\" is a tribute to Robin Williams and I like the deep bass and drum sound. Another catchy tune with another good guitar \r\nsolo after 3 minutes. \"The Man Of Sorrows\" is my final top five pick. I really like how melancholic and dark this is. Check out the heaviness \r\nbefore 3 1/2 minutes. <p>\"Empire Of The Clouds\" is the 18 minute epic that most Prog fans love. I find it kind of wordy especially early on \r\nwhen the pace is slower and Bruce almost speaks the words of this interesting story. Lots of piano early on as well and later on too.

The album was \r\nreleased through <B>Parlophone</B> (UK) and through <B>Sanctuary Copyrights</B>/<B>BMG</B> (US) in September 2015. \r\nIt's been five years and a lot of touring since the release of <em>\"The Final Frontier (2010)\"</em>, but the release of <em>\"The Book \r\nOf Souls\"</em> was also postponed slightly as a consequence of <B>Bruce Dickinson's</B> cancer treatment. <em>\"The Book Of \r\nSouls\"</em> was recorded with producer <B>Keven Shirley</B> at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris from September to December \r\n2014. The same studio the band used when they recorded <em>\"Brave New World (2000)\"</em>. <B>Iron Maiden</B> opted for a \r\nslightly different recording and writing method than usual as all members came in with about an hour of material, and many \r\ntracks were then constructed or finished in the studio based on that material. So many of the tracks were recorded in a few \r\ntakes and with very little time to practice or perfect parts, which was an intentional choice to allow for a more organic and \r\nimmediate sound.<p>At the end of the day <B>Iron Maiden</B> had enough material for a double album release, which is a first in their \r\ndiscography (not counting live albums). Featuring 11 tracks and a full playing time of 92:11 minutes, it's also the longest \r\nstudio album yet released by <B>Iron Maiden</B>. Stylistically the music on the album pretty much continues the band's \r\npost 2000 style, which means the album features only a few fast paced rockers, a good portion of heavier mid-paced tracks, \r\nand quite a few long epic tracks. Among the latter their longest track yet in the 18:01 minutes long closing track <em>\"Empire of \r\nthe Clouds\"</em>. It's fair to say they've developed a taste for more proggy/epic compositions over the years. They used to \r\nonly have a couple of slower epic sounding tracks on each of their albums, but now that's more or less the dominant style.<p>It's no surprise that the musicianship is of high class on all posts. <B>Iron Maiden</B> are seasoned heavy metal veterans \r\nand they know how to play and sing. While they are veterans, they are certainly no dinosaurs, and their performances are \r\ndelivered with both passion and conviction. So it's mostly in the songwriting department that things have changed over the \r\nyears. <p>The material on the album is generally of a high quality. To my ears the highlights are <em>\"If Eternity Should Fail\"</em>, \r\n<em>\"Speed of Light\"</em>, <em>\"The Book of Souls\"</em>, <em>\"Death or Glory\"</em>, <em>\"The Man of Sorrows\"</em>, and the <B>Bruce \r\nDickinson</B> penned epic closing track <em>\"Empire of the Clouds\"</em>. The rest of the material ranges from good to decent, \r\nbut doesn't stand out as much as the mentioned tracks. The overall quality and flow of the album is good though. Stylistically \r\nmost of the material doesn't feauture anything surprising. As always there is a strong emphasis on melody and memorability. \r\nThere are a few surprises in store for the listener though. <em>\"The Man of Sorrows\"</em> is for example a very dark sounding \r\n<B>Iron Maiden</B> track, which is refreshing, and <em>\"Empire of the Clouds\"</em> features piano and orchestra, which as far \r\nas I remember is a first for <B>Iron Maiden</B>.<p><em>\"The Book Of Souls\"</em> features a pretty well sounding production. The guitars could have packed a bit more punch, but \r\nother than that the sound production is well sounding and suits the material well. So all in all this is another quality release by \r\n<B>Iron Maiden</B>. As with most <B>Iron Maiden</B> releases post 2000, you should adjust your expectations to what it \r\nincludes though. There are only three relatively fast-paced rockers featured on the album, and the rest of the material is mid-\r\npaced or slow building and epic (although some sections can be faster paced). It means that the material generally requires \r\nmore attention and more spins to settle, than the more immediate material from their \"classic\" 80s period. But if you can \r\nadjust your expectations to that <em>\"The Book Of Souls\"</em> is quite the enjoyable listen and a 4 star (80%) rating is fully \r\ndeserved.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1483011#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1483011\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1483011\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, November 4, 2015</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1483011)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=49159\"><strong>siLLy puPPy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>PSIKE, JRF/Canterbury, P Metal, Eclectic</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=49159\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/49159/pan-head-dog.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs the heavy metal universe which i opine to have begun around 1970 is well into it's fifth decade as it has expanded from the initial big bang to a vast array of styles that continues to branch out and ever further expand, it is no longer sufficient for one to claim they are a metalhead for these days you have to broaden that statement to include which particular branches of metal you prefer. In my opinion IRON MAIDEN has somehow become the default setting and unofficial mascot of the entire metal universe for i have yet to meet any serious heavy metal fan whether they are into doom, death, black or simply old school classic metal that doesn't have a liking for a few classic MAIDEN albums. From their humble beginnings they were cranking out kick ass material that married all the best elements of heavy music and fast forward to 2015 to their 16th full studio release BOOK OF SOULS and this band that refuses to slow down releases another top notch high quality album that i find to be their best since their classic heyday period ending with \"7th Son Of A 7th Son.\" While other bands that began in the 70s have mostly called it a day or are impudent shriveled foreskins in relation to their glory days, IRON MAIDEN surprises us with a sprawling double album that not only takes cues from every trick in the IRON MAIDEN playbook but expands those signature sounds and ushers them into 21st century relevance like few classic bands have. No viagra needed.<p>I have to admit that i have always seen MAIDEN in a sort of brotherly competition with the other NWOBHM heavyweight Judas Priest, but while Priest has been consistent in delivering albums that have many good tracks i more often than not find there to be a bit of filler that either should have been reworked or weeded out altogether not to mention they fail miserably when incorporating progressive ideas into the mix such as on \"Nostradamus\". MAIDEN on the other hand pretty much delivers on the goods with only the Blaze Bailey years being an aberrant twofer punch for albums that failed to present the high quality of musicianship and songwriting that we have become accustomed to. This brotherly competition between MAIDEN and Priest seems even more glaring as both bands released in the last couple of years albums with the \"SOULS\" in the title. It seems these two bands have reached a similar musical crossroads in their respective careers as Judas Priest seemed to revel in celebrating their entire canon of trademark sounds on their 2014 album \"Redeemer of Souls\" while a year later IRON MAIDEN manages to do the same by not only incorporating the various aspects of their past but sprinkles them with 21st century pixie dust and offers an album that is yet another milepost in the metal history books.<p>The album starts off with the classic \"7th Son\" type synthesized ambience (which is prevalent throughout the album) while Bruce Dickinson displays his mostly unaccompanied vocals that don't seem to have changed one bit since he first hit the scene with \"The Number Of The Beast.\"  With an ambience and metal performance that sounds a bit like \"The Clairvoyant\" from the \"7th Son\" album, it is clear that MAIDEN is back with a vengeance and with this album they can indeed revisit the past and one up the whole thing with their usual expected philosophical lyrics in top notch form along with the mandatory gallops, chord progressions and excellently executed metal delivery. This classic era lineup proves they have the chemistry that passes the test of time and their chops are immune to the corrosive properties that several decades more often than not erodes. After the super strong opener \"If Eternity Should Fail\" brings us back to their past and proves to us they still have that special musical mojo in play, the semi-progressive 8:28 track takes a turn with a strong percussive outburst and a little interlude that adds new musical twists and turns before resolving itself with the familiar established repeated chorus backed up by the addictive triple guitar harmonic assault of the three guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. The track ends with an unaccompanied acoustic guitar with a highly processed spoken lyrics that add a bizarre outro. MAIDEN IS BACK!!!! This is for real :P<p>After the initial shock and awe sinks in, the band deliver their most retro of all tracks with \"Speed Of Light\" that would easily have fit in on the early Dickinson year albums such as \"The Number Of The Beast\" or \"Piece Of Mind.\" The catchy 80s classic metal verse / chorus / bridge formula offers few surprises but does once again cement the fact that MAIDEN can easily match the best of their glory days and then some. The track ends very much like the style heard in \"Run To The Hills\" where the band finds a way to masterfully milk every last note and cadence until it is perfectly sacrificed to the silence that separates the tracks. \"Speed Of Light\" is also the first official single and one of the absolute coolest videos i've ever seen showing Eddie evolve throughout the history of video games. Simply brilliant. The album is now firmly established with a somewhat retro feel that liberally borrows from their entire discography. As we get to the third track \"The Great Unknown\" we are once again treated to the classic song structures that include all those addictive ingredients: metal gallops, wailing melodic vocals, pummeling bass and drums, alternating softer and heavier passages etc. <p>But then beginning with \"The Red And The Black\" we get a strange new style of guitar playing as an intro before breaking into a riff that reminds me a bit of cross between \"Flight Of Icarus\" and the chugging of \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" with excellent alternating sections of Bruce's vocals and a background chorus whipping out the \"oh-oh-oh's.\" This track has lots of cool twists and turns but unfortunately the multi-minute soloing at the end is one of the few aspects of this entire album that wears thin on repeated listens. It's the kind of stuff that makes for a great live setting but when listening repeatedly in an album format seems to irritate me even though i love soloing in general. <p>As the album continues there are more references to previous past glories such as \"When The River Runs Deep\" with a riff that sounds like \"Be Quick Or Be Dead,\" parts of the title track borrow from \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra),\" \"Shadows Of Glory\" starts out suspiciously like \"Wasted Years\" with that high guitar string riffage, \"The Man Of Sorrows\" vaguely reminds of \"To Tame A Land\" at times etc. but the album stays very consistent in delivering high quality riffing, bass abuse and lyrical content. While it may be true that perhaps Bruce Dickinson doesn't quite have the range he used to, the fact that the band has opted for a drop D tuning keeps him firmly in command of the range of the musical progressions that we expect. There's even an 18:01 musical behemoth that sees Bruce Dickinson playing piano and despite this first for the band in both the choice of piano and longest track ever, this still rings of a classic MAIDEN track melodically, rhythmically and in lyrical content. They seem to be unable to bugger up a song no matter how many new elements they throw out and to think that most of this album was created spontaneously in the studio with only a mere scaffolding of ideas at the work table.<p>So all in all, i love this album and have not been this excited about an IRON MAIDEN album since at least \"Brave New World.\" Not that the others in between were bad by any means but they were not nearly as consistent as this one and haven't demanded repeated listens like this one has whispered in my ear. Like most of MAIDEN albums BOOK OF SOULS has the hooks that instantly grab me and the subtleties keep me coming back for more. This album cries out to me to be yet another classic that successfully reflects past glories and also establishes a relevant future but also casts a shadow of doubt upon the future of the band. With Bruce Dickinson's cancerous tumor rearing its ugly head which delayed the album's release it seems as if it could have possibly been the impetus for a creative spree that would be the perfect album to end a long career on. While i hope this not to be the case, a part of me fears it to be true. If this indeed turns out to be the last offering from one of the best bands in history then it would be the a pleasant note to end upon for they have set the bar pretty high here and what i fear more than the band calling it a day would possibly be a string of inferior albums that tarnish the greatness of the past. A near perfect album for me with only few minor blemishes. Yes, it borrows liberally from the past and is not an album that invents a new style of metal, but with a past so wonderful to meld together i really can't complain one bit when it's put together so very well. For me this is another classic album. Pretty damn good accomplishment for their only double studio album. MAIDEN!!!!!<p>4.5 but rounded down because it's not quite a perfect album\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1506669#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1506669\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1506669\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, January 4, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1506669)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWhilst Iron Maiden have never gone full prog metal, they've included progressive elements in their songwriting \r\nthroughout their career to varying degrees with Seventh Son of a Seventh Son the high water mark of this tendency... \r\nuntil now.

Like almost everything \r\nthe band has produced, it is quite good, and has the band's signature sound is always a treat. That being said, \r\n<em>Book of Souls</em> takes some interesting chances here and there, giving it moments to stand out as unique \r\namong the band's lengthy discography. As a group that is, let's face it, getting pretty old, I think this is a great \r\nchoice. They've got nothing to lose, and their recent releases (since <em>Brave New World</em>) have all been great. \r\nWhile <em>Book of Souls</em> is receiving some prog street-cred, my enthusiasm for it is not as strong as previous \r\nalbums. This time around the band actually starts to show their age, creating songs that miss that spark of energy \r\nthat makes Maiden music so exciting. For fans of the band, this hardly matters, because even mediocre Maiden \r\n(which this is not), is still a blast; however, <em>Book of Souls</em> is definitely not the crown-jewel in the iconic group's \r\nregalia of metal masterworks.<p>First off, this is a two-disc album. High-five. That's awesome, even if just for bragging rights. The songs are dense, \r\nhighly melodic, and actually pretty varied. There are some down-tempo tracks and moments within extended works \r\nthat standout as being different than the group's comfort zone. Personally, I think that songs on <em>Final \r\nFrontier</em> were more ambitious and effective, but the writing here is, in general quite good. Ironically, it's the \r\nband's performance itself that doesn't do it for me. Soloing feels routine, and there are few \"wow\" moments that \r\ngrab the attention. Still, the band's rousing melodic moments are thick, heavy, and frequent; they're appealing even \r\nif not as electric as I'd hope.<p>Dickinson especially seems to miss as often as he hits, and it pains me to say it... he's sounding tired. This may have \r\nto do with his health issues during the time leading up to this album. Don't take me wrong, he's not bad or \r\nenjoyable, but there's a noticeable loss of power during his \"fortissimo\" moments. This, combined with the \r\nunchallenging and forgettable lyrics, is a strike against <em>Book of Souls</em> for me. Where the instrumentalists \r\nshow restraint and maturity throughout, Bruce just seems to be unable to stop singing at times, going on and on \r\nwith dense lyrics. <p>The first disc stands out as a solid collection of songs; they're energetic, exciting, and dramatic. The second disc, \r\nincluding the band's longest song ever, \"Empire of the Skies,\" is much less interesting for me. It's sort of plodding, \r\nand lacks the musical ideas to sustain its long running time. Disappointing given the band's streak of success and \r\nnovelty of the extended release format within their discography.<p>All in all a worthy release, especially for Maiden fans, though I find myself more excited about their previous 4 \r\nalbums. Given their age, and musical landscape of the times, it's great to see Iron Maiden still successful and still \r\ngrowing.<p>Songwriting: 4 - Instrumental Performances: 3 - Lyrics/Vocals: 3 - Style/Emotion/Replay: 3</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1614256#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=1614256\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=1614256\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, September 23, 2016</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #1614256)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=69885\"><strong>Hector Enrique</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=69885\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/69885/tool_ojo.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden surprises us with their first double album in more than 35 years of career. At first glance, given the \r\nextensiveness of several of theirs compositions, one might think that their progressive influences-Steve Harris and \r\nbandmates have recognized that Jethro Tull, Genesis, and Yes among several other legends have been an important \r\npart of his musical training-would master this work, and the answer is partly yes, but not completely.<p>Rather, it is a combination of sharp and direct themes typical of heavy metal and hard rock, with others of more \r\ncomplex developments, clearly related to the progressive genre.<p>Within the first group, we place the most typical Iron Maiden songs: tracks full of energy and dominated by \r\ngalloping guitars that lead to dizzying and sharp solos. These include the initial and somber If Eternity Should Fail \r\n(Harris's excellent bass line), the short but forceful guitar-solo of The Great Unknown and its long final curtain, \r\nTears of Clown, the magnificent tribute dedicated to Robin Williams after his fatal demise, a demonstration in turn \r\nthat for a song to be epic, it is not necessary to prolong it to infinity but to have a solid structure and a well-\r\nconceived rhythmic base, and finally, the first minutes of the quasi ballad The Man of Sorrows, with the dying voice \r\nof Bruce Dickinson in excellent form.<p>On the other hand, the progressive vein also occupies an important part of The Book of Souls, with the excellent \r\nRed and the Black, heir to the legendary The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a splendid instrumental development \r\nthroughout the second part of the song and grace of the guitar riff until its end in which it takes up Harris's initial \r\nbass strum to round it out. The Book of Souls that gives the album its name, gives us a forceful halftime and an \r\naggressive rhythmic section to end with an imposing guitar duel, and finally the super progressive Empire of the \r\nClouds, the longest song on the album and the entire Iron Maiden discography. More than 18 minutes in which it \r\ncosts at times to recognize the more traditional Maiden, given the introduction of the piano, the more baroque \r\nstyle of the guitars, the pauses and the lack of urgency to rush the subject, factors that combine to cover an \r\ninsurmountable song that tells the story of the failed flight of the British R101 zeppelin in 1930, a tragedy far less \r\nwell known than the famous 1937 LZ137 Hindenburg zeppelin in New Jersey that Led Zeppelin immortalized on \r\ntheir debut album.<p>The Book of Souls was long overdue for 5 years, after 2010s The Final Frontier, but they were well worth it. An \r\nexcellent album and within the best of Iron Maiden of the 20th century.<p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2480591#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=2480591\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=2480591\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, November 27, 2020</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=49772#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #2480591)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width:34%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#333;padding-top:15px;\">Latest members reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 5px;border-bottom: dotted 1px #e0e0e0; width:100%;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.4em;\">\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"The Book of Souls\" is the sixteenth studio album from heavy metal giants Iron Maiden.
