XIII v.18\r\n \r\nThis excellent album burst onto the rock scene to rapturous applause in 1982 - Maiden \r\nwere already a hugely successful NWOBHM band before Bruce Dickinson joined as \r\nvocalist but this masterpiece was the opening salvo to the band's world domination \r\ncampaign - Bruce \"Air Raid Siren\" Dickinson, Dave Murray,  Adrian Smith, Steve Harris \r\nand Clive Burr on drums. \"The Number of the Beast\" laid down the blueprint for many \r\nalbums that followed.<p>Every track is a classic, especially the title track which is introduced by Vincent Price, \r\nand \"22 Acacia Avenue\".  \"Invaders\" the first track on side one, tells of the Viking \r\nInvaders coming to attack us - \"Axes grind and and maces clash...severed \r\nlimbs....bloody corpses..\"\r\nall classic Prog themes done as blistering heavy rock. \"Children of the Damned\" has a  \r\nslow intro which builds up and bursts into a fantastic chorus, great riffing and the Air \r\nRaid siren  \r\nwails....a real horror! \"The Prisoner\" is a homage to the enigmatic TV classic starring \r\nPatrick McGoohan - \"I am not a number...I am a free man!\", followed by \"22 Acacia \r\nAvenue (the continuing story of Charlotte the Harlot) \"  a mini epic about somebody \r\nyou should meet and mistreat if you're down the East End - and she only charges \r\nfifteen quid!!!<p>Side two kicks off with the title track \"The Number of the Beast\" , one of my all time \r\nfavourite tracks, the energy on this is phenomenal to listen to, real Gothic Horror at its \r\nbest, the archetypal Maiden song, after the famous spoken intro Bruce whispers his \r\nway into the song then explodes, \"Torches raised and  sacred chants were praised...\" -\r\n  amazing!  \"Run to the Hills\" was a smash hit for the band, and contains the \r\ntrademark \"galloping\" drums and bass, intertwined with sizzling lead guitar, and told \r\nabout the plight of the American Indians suffering the onslaught of white man's \r\ndomination of their land - \"Raping the women and wasting the men, the only good \r\nIndians are tame...\" - the rest is history. \"Gangland \" tells of the dangers of the criminal \r\nunderworld, \"Dead men tell no tales\", murder, contracts - a murky world. The last track \r\non my vinyl LP \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is the longest track on the album, another mini \r\nepic about a condemned man - waiting for the minutes to tick by until 5 o'clock....\"If \r\nthere's a God then why has he let me die..?\"<p>Truly a very important album in the history of rock, its influence paving the way for \r\nHeavy rock and Prog -metal , a deserving five stars in anybody's book and an essential \r\naddition to any rock music collection!<p>MUSIC RATING 5/5  PROG RATING 4/5\r\nHISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE - PRICELESS\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93039#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93039\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93039\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93039)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=5630\"><strong>darkshade</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=5630\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/5630/zappa_1988_color_480.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe first of the Classic Three, the other two being Piece of Mind and Powerslave. This \r\nalbum was the biggest thing in rock for a long time when i t was released. Songs like Run to \r\nthe Hills, The Prisoner, the title track, and Children of the Damned are damn good proto-\r\nprog metal tunes. All with extremely catchy melodies that will just drive into your head and \r\nnever leave. One key factor is the fading prescence of their earlier punk influence. It's still \r\nkinda there, but not really noticable. The production is miles ahead of their previous \r\noutings, with crystal clear guitars, upfront bass, and every drum part heard perfectly.<p>Of course the biggest change was the introduction of the almighty Bruce Dickinson. His \r\nvoice gave new sound to the band and a freshness not heard since their debut. His 'air raid \r\nsiren' name, he would later get after Powerslave, brings much more to the table. The music \r\nis more melodic than before, more harder edged, and MUCH more driven.<p>As good as this album is, it would be NOTHING without the final epic track 'Hallowed Be Thy \r\nName'. The famous opening that builds up tension to Dickinson holding out one of the best \r\nsustaining tones in all of vocal history, and from there it's all money in the bag. The main \r\ntheme just makes you think 'epic', but is not cheesy one bit. The more uptempo outro with \r\nthe solo section is probably one of the band's best, most energetic piece of music they \r\never created. A prog-metal masterpiece.<p>Speaking of masterpieces, this one is. Almost every prog-metal technique used in the \r\ngenre was first used here. And if it wasn't, it was used on at least the next 4 albums. I \r\nmean, Dream Theater covered this album!<p>HIGH RECOMMENDED. Probably one of the best albums to start out with.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93113#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93113\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93113\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93113)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=2647\"><strong>Bj-1</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=2647\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/2647/smmw4.png\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWhat can I say? This became Iron Maiden's best selling album, reaching #1 spots on the \r\ncharts in the UK. It soon became on of the landmarks in heavy metal history and is a \r\nnecessary album to own if you are deeply into this genre. Not because it sold so well and \r\ngained Maiden's popularity to the maximal at that time, but because of the excellent music \r\nhere, containing some of their best songs ever. However, this is not a progressive album in \r\nany sense. OK, \"Hallowed be thy Name\" might give some hint of what to come but \r\notherwise, please don't concider this as a prog album, but as an excellent heavy metal \r\nalbum. <p>It's one of their best though and the title track stands as one of my favorite metal songs. \r\nEvery musician plays extremely well and the music is powerfull and great. This was Clive \r\nBurr's last album with the band. Nicko McBrain replaced him after this one, but I think \r\nthey're equally as good. But somehow, McBrain fits better to Maiden, though it doesn't \r\naffect Burr's drumming at all on this album. That being said, my personal rating for this \r\nalbum is 4.5/5, though I wouldn't recommend it to a standard progger's collection. But if \r\nyou are into heavy metal and stuff, this one is definitely NOT to be missed!\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93132#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93132\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93132\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 2, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93132)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=325\"><strong>Sean Trane</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>Prog Folk</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAttention: true story. At the time of release of this album, I was living on Riverside Drive and further down the street lived a complete metalhead whom I was fairly friendly with. He lived at number 664 and we used to call him \"The Neighbour Of The Beast\" and use to rile him with it. But In Canada, the street address numbers generally jump by 6 or 8 at a time so there was not 666, so the beast became a squirrel up his tree which was always offered some sacrifice, the axe offered and planted in the ground and candles were often seen burning in his honour. I think that not many squirrels had such loving care as Lucifer (as we had called him) did. Silly young progheads ;-) !!!!<p>Count me as one of those that was completely shattered when DiAnno got the boot, but one must recognize that his replacement was a fitting one. Maiden had one of the most impressive metal voices around. Dickinson \"Air Raid Siren\" is definitely the classic sound of Maiden and only the first hour fans can say otherwise. But let's face it, it is with this third album (and two hilarious B&W footage video-clips receiving constant MTV rotation) and Dickinson that Maiden acquired a whole new dimension (at least in terms of audience).<p>Actually I was not that big a fan of this album, as it was confirming the slick production of the previous Killers album. But the two hits, Run To The Hills and the title track were so often played, along with Children Of The Damned also receiving regular airplay, while the above-mentioned friends were always raving about Hallowed Be Thy Name (the only remotely prog track on this album, IMHO) and Acacia Avenue (another metalhead buddy was living on 22 Willow Street ;-), that shunning exposition to the album was hopeless. <p>Overall , I can only say that TNOTB only differs from Killers by the singer's voice, the rest not changing much. They were on the upswing, so there were absolutely no reasons to change anything. History will prove them right.\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93154#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93154\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93154\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 3, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93154)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=636\"><strong>greenback</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=636\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070406_021031_5294921.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n\"Number of the Beast\" is one of the heaviest metal albums ever recorded, obviously after \r\nBlack Sabbath's \"Mob rules\": indeed, the guitars, the drums and the bass combination form \r\nhere a very HEAVY and powerful texture. However, the rhythmic guitar riffs are not as \r\nsustained as on Black Sabbath's \"Mob rules\", and they are also faster here: that's one of \r\nthe reasons that explain why \"Mob rules\" is heavier. <p>There are many melodic and catchy guitar solos, like the one on \"22 Acacia Avenue\". The \r\nvocals intro on the powerful \"Prisoner\" are taken from the TV series \"The Prisoner\", starring \r\nPatrick McGoohan: the track itself is VERY catchy and addictive; Dickinson's excellent vocals \r\nmake this track an accessible one. The \"Number of the Beast\" track is UNIVERSALLY known: \r\nthe diabolic & narrative style of the intro voice retains the attention; Dickinson produces an \r\nhysterical & echoed scream in the beginning; just after the fast wah-wah guitar solo, the \r\nbass - rhythmic guitars - drums ensemble attain and unprecedented rich & colorful sound: it \r\nis really IMPRESSIVE. After the melodic & twisted guitar solo on \"Run to the hills\", Harris \r\ngoes with an amazing pattern of high & fast notes, supporting very well the extreme \r\nscream by Dickinson. \"Hallowed be thy name\" is practically a metal prog track, with its \r\nmultiple rhythm & air changes. With this album, Iron Maiden still does not completely reach \r\ntheir typical sharp, incisive and clean sound, like on the next album \"Piece of mind\". <p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93547#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=93547\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=93547\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, October 5, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #93547)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=11104\"><strong>1800iareyay</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter Paul Di'Anno's departure from Iron Maiden due to substance abuse, the band \r\nsnatched up Bruce Dickinson from fellow NWOBHMers Samson. The newly invigorated \r\nlineup released Number of the Beast. Whereas the first two albums had built a cult \r\nfollowing, NotB blew a hole open that would mark the beginning of Maiden's classic era and \r\nthe peak of its fame. It's a bit overrated, however.<p>Dickinson's air raid siren voice set off a wave of imitators. \"Children of the Damned\" \r\nperfectly shows his range to his new fans. \"Run to the Hills\" and the title track offer an \r\ninsane mid-album punch with the former's gallop and the latter's crunch, both of which \r\nhave great performances form Bruce. \"Remember Tomorrow\" is a oft-forgotten track that \r\ngood, but it doesn't stick. \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is Maiden's finest track. The tale of a \r\nprisoner about to be hanged, it contains all the elements the band, as well as imitators, \r\nwould later exploit: bleakness, alternating soft acoustic/heavt electric, soaring vocals, \r\npounding bass. <p>However, the rest of teh album seems like filler. \"22 Acacia Avenue,\" the follow-up \r\nto \"Charlotte the Harlot,\" lacks the fire of the original. \"Invaders\" and \"Gangland\" are \r\nstaight-foward, not a problem, but they don't have that spark that makes Maiden's \r\nstraight-forward tracks so enjoyable. \"The Prisoner\" hovers between good and average.<p>This album marked a transition for the band. Dickinson firmly cemeted himself as Maiden's \r\nvocalist, and drum wizard Nicko McBrain was about to join the band and complete the \r\nclassic lineup. THe next album would cofirm that Maiden had arrived, and Bruce's vocals \r\nbecame perfectly intigrated with the band. This album would warrant four stars on a metal \r\nsite, but here it gets a three for it's lack of prog.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=103470#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=103470\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=103470\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, December 18, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #103470)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=3398\"><strong>Zitro</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n3.4 Stars<p>A landmark album in the history of heavy metal. This album marks the arrival of the\r\nfamous singer Bruce Dickinson, charactarised by the siren sounding screams he often\r\nlets out. I personally prefer the voice of the original singer, but Dickinson is\r\nstill superior to most metal singers I know. The music in this album is somewhat\r\nheavier, helped by Dickinson's more powerful voice. The Number of The Beast features\r\nthe galloping rhythms, tight songwriting, electric guitar riffs, and catchy choruses.\r\nSome of the most well-known Iron Maiden pieces are here, namely  Number of the Beast,\r\nRun to the Hills, and Hallowed By Thy Name.<p>The most straightforward songs are <strong> Invaders, Gangland </strong>. Invaders is a typical\r\nIron Maiden opener, being fast-paced and straightforward. Gangland is another typical\r\nfast-paced metal song, making it (as well as the opener) the least interesting songs\r\nin the album. <strong> 22 Acacia Avenue </strong> is longer, but it contains a tempo changing\r\nleading to a wonderful performance of double guitars in minute 4. <strong> Children of the\r\nDamned </strong> is similar and almost as good as the phenomenal \"Remember Tomorrow\" from their\r\ndebut. Here, Dickinson proves to be  an excellent singer, showing a lot of\r\nflexibility and power in his vocals. As in \"Remember Tomorrow\" the vocals and guitar\r\nriff of the choruses are extremely memorable. The second half is fast-paced but\r\ninteresting, with a wonderful and virtuosic guitar solo. <strong> The Prisoner </strong> is an\r\nentertaining long song that unfortunately suffers from being a bit repetitive.<p>The remaining three songs I haven't mentioned yet are highlights here. <strong> The Number\r\nof the Beast </strong> opens with a nice electric guitar riff and vocals which go in a\r\ncrescendo until Dickinson lets out a mighty scream that makes your hair stand up. The\r\nrest of the song is catchy with hooks on the choruses, making this a very accessible\r\nclassic. <strong> Run to the Hills </strong> begins with an unforgettable guitar riff and\r\ncatchy drum beat. The rest is more catchy music, with a sing-along chorus that sticks\r\nin your head for days. <strong> Hallowed By Thy Name </strong> is usually regarded as Iron\r\nMaiden's ultimate achievement. While I disgree, it is still an impressive song that\r\nbegins with a dark atmosphere with bells and Dickinson's vocals at his best and\r\nfollows with a display of technical musicianship recalling \"Phantom of the Opera\"\r\nfrom their debut.<p>OVerall, this is a good heavy metal album that should appeal to almost anyone\r\ninterested in the genre. I recommend it, as us proggers sometimes could\r\nuse of some break from the demanding genre of progressive rock/metal. Number of the\r\nBeast does not prog, but it metals!<p><p></strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104598#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=104598\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=104598\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, December 26, 2006</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #104598)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=9980\"><strong>Mellotron Storm</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=9980\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070716_153513_cover_431220229.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is the record that not only introduced Bruce Dickinson to the world, but also IRON \r\nMAIDEN to new legions of fans. I know for me personally it was great to have \r\nIRON MAIDEN to listen to during the eighties.They thank UFO and JUDAS PRIEST in the \r\nliner notes, two bands that I love as well. And I have to say that the drumming of Clive Burr \r\nis quite extraordinary throughout this record.<p>\r\n\"Invaders\" and \"Gangland\" are both extremely fast paced songs with Clive on the drum kit \r\nkeeping very busy. While \"The Prisoner\" is not as furious as those two, but it is also a straight \r\nforward song. \"Children Of The Damned\" features some nice heavy drumming with melodic \r\nguitar playing until the pace picks up 3 minutes in with some great guitar and drums. \"22 \r\nAcacia Avenue\" has some uptempo riffing and I know i'm being a broken record but the \r\ndrumming does stand out again. I like the tempo change 4 minutes in.<p>\"The Number Of The \r\nBeast\" is a classic ! There is some amazing bass in this song and check out the guitar 3 \r\nminutes in ! This song is like a raging fire ! \"Run To The Hills\" opens with drums and a \r\nmemorable riff and then the awesome vocals of Mr.Dickinson come in \"Run to the hills...run \r\nfor your lives\". \"Total Eclipse\" is a nice heavy melodic tune that accellerates with some \r\nscorching guitar and more incredible vocals.The closing song \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" has a \r\nslower paced 1 minute intro before we get that galloping rhythm that MAIDEN would \r\nbecome famous for, that includes some fantastic guitar and drumming. It just sounds so \r\ngood !<p>\r\nI know many of their fans put this record at the top of the heep, but for me it's down the \r\nlist a ways, not that I don't love it, it's just I prefer some of their others even more.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=108642#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=108642\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=108642\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, January 24, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #108642)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10657\"><strong>The T</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10657\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10657/hachiko1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWell, I think it's time to review more albums from my favorite non-prog band (at least \r\nnot 100% prog, as they definitely have prog elements in their music). I'll start with this \r\nrecord as I don't have the first two (IRON MAIDEN and KILLERS. Though I have heard \r\nthem, just not enough to write a review about them). I just re-purchased again almost \r\nall of their albums and I believe sharing my views about them it's in order. <p>After former vocalist Paul D'Anno had left, Iron Maiden found themselves with the \r\nopportunity to make the big jump from being just a mildly successful and musically \r\nmoderately interesting metal group in their native England to becoming one (if not THE) \r\nbest heavy metal bands in history and one of the most successful acts around the \r\nwhole world. Their punk-influenced NWOBHM was going to undergo major changes, \r\nwith the addition of many progressive elements to the music and, specially, with the \r\narrival of master singer Bruce Dickinson to the band. Dickinson's input in Iron Maiden \r\nhas always been nothing short of spectacular, and he brought with him depth, \r\nmusicality, melody, power, in a word: he gave the band the final touch of \r\n<em>identity</em> it needed, being the perfect deliverer for Steve Harris's musical idea. <p>THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST remains Iron Maiden's most successful album to date (in \r\nterms of records sold) though it's far from their best. Even though it has a lot of good \r\nsongs, the sound is still somewhat raw around the edges, there's still a little bit of punk \r\nin the music (something I don't like) and the band itself wasn't complete yet. In the next \r\nalbum, PIECE OF MIND, with the inclusion of drummer Nicko McBrain, the British band \r\nwould finally be complete and ready to achieve greater musical heights. <p>Let's say a few words about the songs.<p> Invaders (7.5/10) The song starts with a bang and then we enter metal territory in full \r\nforce, though punk-influenced metal at that. Burr's drumming is quite tight in this track, \r\nand Harris as always shows how to play great bass even though he's not really playing \r\nincredibly complex harmonics. He just knows how to adorn, how to decorate even the \r\nsimplest of bass lines. Good track, nothing extraordinaire. It still sounds like KILLERS, \r\nthough with a far superior singer. <p> Children of The Damned (8/10) This is a change. Arpeggios announce a soft song, a \r\nsad, slow moment that is melodic and that showcases Dickinson's vocal prowess. The \r\nsong gets faster halfway down, in a formula very typical of Maiden, though used to \r\nmuch greater success in other tracks (and in this same album). Decent song. The guitar \r\nsolos by Smith and Murray and the dramatic ending make this a good track.<p> The Prisoner (7.5/10) A simple drum rhythm introduces this song, which starts quite \r\nweakly, sounding almost as Kiss. But it doesn't last long, as the ferocious guitar attack \r\nis unleashed a few seconds later. Pure adrenaline and energy, the melodic values are \r\nnot too high. The chorus is catchy and lively, though a little ridiculous. Another good-if-\r\nnot-great song.<p> 22 Acacia Avenue (7.5/10) This song caused some minor troubles for Iron Maiden, as \r\nthe inhabitants of 22 Acacia Avenue weren't happy about their address being used in \r\nthe album as the location where people went to purchase pleasure. The song is a little \r\nbit chaotic, lacking the coherence of future Maiden mini-epics. It has decent melody, \r\nand it's a enjoyable, if not really brilliant, track. <p> The Number of The Beast (9/10) The ominous words taken from the Book of \r\nRevelations announce that something different will unfold here. The reverb-full guitar \r\nchords at the beginning confirm the arrival of a new monster, and Dickinson's vocals on \r\ntop of them finally make D'Anno's memory just a distant, and not desirable, one. The \r\nguitar solo is superb, short but precise and melodic, epic; Harris and the guitars always \r\nin perfect synchronicity, always being each other's best friends. The first true gem in \r\nthe album, it's still not a perfect track but it clearly paved the way for future \r\nmasterpieces. <p> Run to The Hills (8.5/10) Arguably Iron Maiden's absolute hit, it's not my favorite track \r\nbut is nevertheless a pleasure to listen to. After the legendary drum rhythm by Clive \r\nBurr, the guitars join emulating the percussion, and a short-yet-memorable little song is \r\nborn. The chorus, while not even close to some of this band's best (and they DO have \r\ngreat choruses), is probably their most successful ever. Burr's drumming is precise, if \r\nsimple. I love how Harris adorns his bass lines under the guitar solos, it's just a matter \r\nof adding a little note here, a little note there, and it makes a simple idea sound \r\nfantastic. Great track.<p> Gangland (7/10) A frantic, over-excited drum rhythm marks the beginning of this ultra-\r\nenergetic yet somewhat forgettable hell-ride of a song. Pure metal, with little in the \r\nway of subtleties or melody. Just headbanging stuff. Though even in this insignificant \r\ntrack the masters found a way to give us enjoyable guitar solos.  Even at their most \r\nsavage, Iron Maiden are in a class of their own.   <p> Total Eclipse (6.5/10) It had to happen, the album had to have a true weak, boring \r\ntrack. The band was still too fresh out of their first musical era, and it was impossible to \r\nexpect a perfect album from the get-go. This song is longer than needed (and it's not \r\nreally that long), lacks melody, lacks punch, lacks adrenaline, it even <strong>lacks Harris' \r\ninspired playing.</strong> Not atrocious, but very, very weak. The problem, though, was \r\ngoing to be resolved after this.<p> Hallowed be Thy Name (9.5/10) The fist masterpiece by Iron Maiden, the first track in \r\nthis album that reminds me why this is my favorite non-totally-prog band. Speaking of \r\nprogressiveness, this song is the one to look at to find those elements. From the sad \r\nbeginning to the desperate chants of the soon-to-be-executed to the fantastic guitar \r\nmelodies, to Burr's simple but on-target drumming, to the whole building of tension, this \r\ntrack has everything I love in Maiden. Those epic guitars, those guitars that seem to be \r\nscreaming in anger and yearning for melody. Then the pause, the moment of doubt, \r\nand finally the OTHER Maiden, the metal machine, the adrenaline-pump, the wave that \r\ndestroys everything in its wake. If I have doubts about giving this song a 10, it's because it sounds a little empty, the sonic experience is not \"full\", for lack of a better word, and mostly because Maiden delivered even better songs in future albums. But the return \r\nof the original melody in the fast section with the guitars reassured me that this is the \r\nband's first masterpiece. <p> After such an ending, we leave our THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST experience with quite \r\nthe smile in our faces. The album is not perfect, it's still too rough and too noisy, but it \r\nhas its moments. I'll give it a four, if only for historical reasons. The music gets a 3, the \r\nimportance of the album makes the rating climb one step higher. <p> Recommended for: Fans of Iron Maiden; fans of heavy metal; fans of hard rock in \r\ngeneral who like to experience one of the landmarks in metal history. <p> Not recommended for: People who dislike metal; people who prefer their music to be \r\n100% prog; and Paul D'Anno's fans..<p>. this will leave you hopeless. Dickinson really is the Best for The Beast. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126284#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=126284\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=126284\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, June 18, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #126284)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12519\"><strong>SoundsofSeasons</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12519\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12519/muppet_animal.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThis is fantastic metal album.

With new vocalist Bruce Dickinson onboard, the band seems to be searching somewhat on how songs should be\r\nplayed and arranged to suit his voice; which is very different from previous vocalist Paul Di'Anno's. At the same time, the\r\nband starts showing off more of what will be their own trademark sound here, with fast-paced riffing, more harmonic\r\nguitar-playing and the bass guitar clearly a solid foundation in many tracks.<p>Musically Iron Maiden to some extent leave their punkish on this release; production and playing eliminating many of the\r\nrough edges of punk in the past, while the fast paced and at times staccato riffing developed due to the punk influences now\r\nto a greater extent has been developed into something new.<p>Iron Maidens trademark type of songs are developed here, with fast-paced riff-based rockers, some more mellow atmospheric\r\ntracks and the first raw examples of what would develop into the classic epic tracks being in place on this release. <p>The music is clearly heavy metal throughout; but influences and inspirations are not as easily identified here; and in many\r\naspects this is the album where Iron Maiden lay down the foundations for their individual version of heavy metal.<p>There are many classic songs on this release, but also a few that are a tad on the weak side. The classic tracks here are all\r\nhousehold names for most; and as with previous release Killers these songs are the main reason for adding this release to the\r\nmusic collection.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=135823#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=135823\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=135823\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, September 2, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #135823)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1699\"><strong>sean</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1699\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1699/icecream.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAs Iron Maiden was the first rock band I really got into, I feel I should review the first Maiden album I heard. I love this\r\nalbum. It's not my favourite, but it does have sentimental value, and a few great songs. None of the songs are bad, although\r\nI don't like some as much as the others. For example, \"22 Acacia Avenue\" and \"Run to the Hills\" never really grew on me. The\r\nbest song on here, though, is \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", a mini-epic about a condemned man. The power this song has is\r\nincredible, and you can't help but thinking that it is you that is headed to the gallows. My other favourites are \"Invaders\",\r\nwhich is about viking raids (you don't get much more metal than that), the title track, which was about a nightmare Steve\r\nHarris had, and led everyone to think they were satanic, and Children of the Damned, which starts off as a kind of power\r\nballad then builds up into a rocker with that energy that Maiden is known for. I wouldn't call it their best work, but it's\r\nvery good and comes highly recommended.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=140098#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=140098\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=140098\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, September 23, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #140098)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=4553\"><strong>FruMp</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nProg or nay this is a classic heavy metal album.<p>Iron Maiden are perhaps one of the most well known and influential heavy metal bands ever and their 1982 album 'Number of the\r\nBeast' their first album with vocalist Bruce Dickinson cemented their popularity scoring a number one hit in the UK. The\r\nalbum is chock full of heavy metal classics, there isn't a single weak track on here 22 Accacia Avenue has a great middle\r\nsection hinting at speed metal, The title track is probably the best on the album, utterly triumphant with bitchin' solos -\r\nhow could you not sing along to it?, sure it's cheesy but this is 80's aggresive cheese, get out those torn jeans and massive\r\nsunnglasses.  Run to the hills is a fast paced song about cowboys and indians, one of their most popular singles. Hallowed be\r\nthy name is probably the only song on the album with a strong progressive link clocking in at over 7 minutes with a\r\nnon-standard structure, this would be my second favourite song behind the title track, some of the best riffs on the album,\r\nsupertight harmonies, triumph, aggression, speed, bitchin' solos - it's all here.<p>This is a must have album for any serious heavy metal fan, sure it's not really prog but it's still a fantastic album that\r\ndeserves to be recognised as such in spite of that fact. 4.5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=144761#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=144761\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=144761\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, October 15, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #144761)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1883\"><strong>ZowieZiggy</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nExit Di Anno, welcome Bruce Dickinson.<p>Even if the Maiden changed from vocalist, their style won't change very much. Still the same good old wild hard-rock. This album was \r\ntheir first number one in the UK charts (more to follow). As their previous album, this one won't let you breathe for a second.<p>You might think that \"Children Of The Damned\" will be somewhat smoother. But if it starts as an average rock ballad, its crescendo \r\nbuild up makes it the highlight of this album. Absolutely irresistable. <p>Don't look to anything prog releated in this album (but this is not a creative statement) : what you'll get is again wild stuff. With \r\ncharacter and skills.<p>The most elaborate song \"22, Acacia Avenue\" is a brilliant hard-rock / heavy metal anthem. Wonderful guitar play and an incredible \r\nrhythmic section of course. Business as usual. Maiden day to day operations. But these dual guitars are exceptional.<p>The incredible beat of their previous album \"Killers\" is just repeated. Even one punkish song is featured here again : \"Gangland\" (and \r\nnot \"Garageland\" of whom you might know...). My fave is \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". More complex and accomplished than the other \r\nsongs featured on this album. A great closing number.<p>This is a good album for hard-rock / heavy metal lovers. I guess that the average proghead will stay away from this sort of \r\nrecordings. As of any Maiden album actually...<p>Three stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=151639#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=151639\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=151639\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, November 18, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #151639)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=405\"><strong>Gatot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>An album praised by metalheads!</strong><p>In some reviews about Iron Maiden I clearly stated that this band was originally not my cup of tea, especially looking at the\r\ntime of release of this album. During that time I was bombarded with many spins of progressive rock albums from Genesisi,\r\nYes, Gentle Giant etc. At that time Genesis was very popular in my country especially two big cities I frequently visited:\r\nBandung (because I took an engineering study here) and Jakarta (where my mom stayed). The local band called \"Cockpit\" was\r\nvery famous covering Genesis songs and they toured many venues in Indonesia. But that was the time also when progressive\r\nmusic was swept by the strong winds of punk and new wave music, so I was really not happy. I heard Iron Maiden name\r\nfrequently from my hard rock friends but I never paid attention with the band because I did not like the cover which did not\r\nseem a cover of progressive band. I only knew Iron Maiden music after year 2000 when Indonesian classic rock FM radio station\r\naired \"Flight of Icarus\" - a song that blew me away at first listen. I called the radio station and asked who played that\r\nbeautiful and rockin' track. Once I got enough detail on artist and the album, I then purchased the \"Piece of Mind\" CD. An\r\nexcellent album, really.<p>Since then I kept purchasing any release of Iron Maiden, including \"The Number of The Beast\" which I rarely spun until time\r\nwhen the rock community where I belongs to, i-Rock!, conducted a Tribute to Iron Maiden couple of months ago in Jakarta. So I\r\nspun this CD and enjoyed the music because most of them are hard rock music. The opening track \"Invaders\" (3:25) is a\r\nstraight rocker which fits as an opening track. My excitement starts from track 2 \"Children Of The Damned\" (4:35) which\r\nstarts beautifully in mellow style with guitar fills. It flows nicely with great melody. <p>\"The Prisoner\" (6:04), \"22 Acacia Avenue\" (6:37) are all excellent hard rock tracks that stimulate me without even I need to\r\nre-spin them because all of them are quite catchy at first listen. The title track \"The Number Of The Beast\" (4:52) has\r\nbecome a mascot in whatever tribute to Iron Maiden must be played by the band, because it contains high register notes vocal\r\nline by Bruce Dickinson. Because I have been trained by 70s music, Bruce's voice is somewhat similar with Ronnie James Dio.\r\nOne thing I do like about Iron Maiden music is the dynamic bass lines played by the mastermind of the band: Steve Harris. I\r\nthink, he is one of the best bass players in hard rock music, including Gary Thain of Uriah Heep.<p>Today, I spin this CD again because I listened to \"The Number of The Beast\" by Dream Theater. I just want to see how it\r\ncompares between the two versions. My views on Dream Theater part would be featured on other thread in Dream Theater.<p>Overall, this album remarks one of the best hard rock music record. Most of the songs are heavy in nature and very enjoyable\r\nif hard rock or metal is already in your blood. But if you are not a hard rockers, you might find it difficult to enjoy the\r\nmusic of \"The Number of The Beast\". The other factor I enjoy much this album is the double guitar style by Dave Murray and\r\nAdrian Smith. It's an excellent addition to any hard rock / metal music collection. I have sensed that this album was\r\ninfluenced by the heavy metal master Black Sabbath - as some riffs remind me to the music of Black Sabbath. <strong>Keep on\r\nproggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p>\r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=152468#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=152468\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=152468\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, November 24, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #152468)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=8691\"><strong>Flucktrot</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=8691\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/avatars/20070908_201329_joshuatree.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe Beast produces two excellent tracks (title track and Hallowed By Thy Name), along with seven other fairly straightforward\r\nhead-bangers that really don't do much for the progger in me.<p>How about those two excellent tracks?  The Number of the Beast features an excellent, energetic  build-up before hitting\r\nfull-speed metal-mode.  And when it gets there, you're more than prepared to do some serious fist-pumping.  I also enjoy the\r\nguitar/instrumental break more than most--you can really hear Harris hammering away on bass more than the other tracks. \r\nThere is also some prog to be found on the album as well, and that is of course Hallowed Be Thy Name.  Everything about this\r\ntrack is well done, from the creepy intro, to the hard-driving chorus, to Dickinson's use of a bit of welcome restraint, all\r\nbuilding up to the double-time conclusion, where the band just flat out rocks for a few minutes.  It seems Maiden were still\r\nperfecting the twin guitar attack at this point, but in this song in particular they find the formula that would lead to\r\nfuture glory.<p>The rest?  I can appreciate the influence that this album had on future metal groups--you can just hear it.  Therein lies\r\npart of the problem--I feel like I've heard much of this elsewhere, and it sounds a bit formulaic.  That being said, Maiden\r\ndo try to mix things up, from the quasi-power ballad (Children of the Damned), to speed-metal rockers (Gangland), to Maiden's\r\nuniquely frenetic and creative tunes (Invaders).  <p>If you need to rock out, Maiden will always do the trick.  If you need some prog, there's really only one track on here that\r\nwill suffice.  Personally, Maiden are too consistently hard-driving on this album for me to listen all the way through often,\r\nand I can also only handle so much of Dickinson's over-the-top, frequently flat vocals, but I certainly recognize a solid\r\nmetal album like this when I hear it.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156133#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=156133\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=156133\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, December 21, 2007</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #156133)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16511\"><strong>UMUR</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16511\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16511/82476_82477.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nThe third album from Iron Maiden is an ultimate heavy metal classic. In classic status this can be \r\ncompared to such heavy metal and hard rock albums as Black Sabbath\u00b4s Paranoid, AC/DC\u00b4s Back in \r\nBlack and Metallica\u00b4s Black Album. This is in other words an album almost every heavy metal fan \r\nowns. The album stirred up a lot of controversy when it came out because of the title, the cover and \r\nthe lyrical content in the title  track. Right wing Christian organizations found a perfect scapegoat in \r\nIron Maiden and called them satanists. This is as far from the truth as you can get though. The only \r\nsong on The Number of the Beast that has anything to do with occultism is the title track and it is not a \r\nsong that worships satanism. Not that I mind. If you want to hear really blasphemous bands try out \r\nsome of the norwegian black metal bands or the american band Decide, then you\u00b4ll have something to \r\nbe offended or even outraged about. The Number of the Beast is only a story, nothing more.<p>The music has changed a bit since Killers which is mostly due to the fact that Bruce(the siren)Dickinson \r\nhas become the new singer in Iron Maiden. Bruce has a totally different voice compared to Paul \r\nDi\u00b4anno. Bruce is and extremely skilled singer who masters the whole register. He sings with lots of \r\npaatos and theatrical skill. Paul Di\u00b4anno had a more limited voice range and his vocals were more raw. \r\nThe music is still very melodic heavy metal. No progressive tendencies are heard yet in Iron Maiden\u00b4s \r\nmusic. <p>The double guitar attack from Adrian Smith and Dave Murray are very melodic yet powerful and talking \r\nabout powerful listen to Steve Harris bass and Clive Burr\u00b4s drumming. Now that\u00b4s what I call a \r\npowerful rythm section. This would be Clive Burr\u00b4s last album with Iron Maiden.<p>All songs on this album are classic Iron Maiden material that they have played live for thousands of \r\ntimes. Especially the title track is an ultimate heavy metal anthem that is played every time Iron \r\nMaiden perform. Songs like Run to the Hills and Hallowed Be Thy Name are also live classics. Both \r\nChildre of the Damned and 22 Acacia Avenue have also been played many times. Both are great songs \r\nand the latter is a continuation of the story about Charlotte the Harlot from Iron Maiden\u00b4s debut. The \r\nPrisoner needs to be mentioned too with it\u00b4s classic sample intro. It\u00b4s also a song Iron Maiden fans \r\nlove. Invaders is a powerful song to start the album. Listen to Steve Harris bass playing in this song. \r\nReally fast. Gangland is the least known song from The Number of the Beast, but I think it is enjoyable. \r\nTotal Eclipse must be a CD bonus track as it is not on my original LP, I think I remember it being a b-\r\nside to one of the singles released with the album.<p>This is such a classic heavy metal album and even though it is not my favorite Iron Maiden album this \r\nfully deserves 4 stars as it is a really excellent album. Highly recommendable. Fans of Deep Purple, \r\nRainbow, UFO and other seventies hard rock bands should be able to find pleasure in this album as well \r\nas heavy metal fans. This is not a progressive album though and might not appeal to everyone in here.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=165247#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=165247\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=165247\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, March 28, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #165247)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=1442\"><strong>russellk</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=1442\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/1442/Avatar.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nI've never understood the fascination with these inept pap-metal merchants. There's nothing visceral\r\nhere, nothing that makes you sweat with fear. IRON MAIDEN produce relentlessly upbeat, simple rock\r\nsongs that owe a great deal more to hard rock a la DEEP PURPLE and glam rockers like KISS than to\r\ntrue heavy metallers such as BLACK SABBATH. This surprisingly successful album demonstrates my point.<p>From the flat faux-operatic wailing of DICKINSON (hit the note, man!) to the frantic riffing of\r\nMURRAY and SMITH - why it takes two guitarists to make such a thin sound is beyond me - this is\r\nmetal by numbers. Simple rock 'n' roll dressed up in halloween masks. How this band became wildly\r\nsuccessful when far superior bands like RAINBOW did not can be attributed to their image and the\r\nrecord-buying public's reaction to the synth-pop fodder they were being fed at the time. There isn't\r\na musician here who could hold a candle to anyone in the RAINBOW lineup, but they did have a good\r\nmascot.<p>What of the music? Well, there's no 'Stargazer' here, that's for sure. Nothing remotely as good.\r\n'Children of the Damned' holds my interest for a moment or two, but apart from that and the faintly\r\nprogressive 'Hallowed be Thy Name' there's nothing but spangly sterility here. Music for teenagers\r\nto annoy their parents with, nothing more. The sort of music I turn down out of embarrassment if\r\nanyone comes knocking at the door.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=167748#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=167748\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=167748\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Thursday, April 17, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #167748)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10022\"><strong>The Whistler</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10022\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10022/J-Tull_Christmas--again--small.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n(3.5, the NUMBAH OF THE BEAST!!!)<p>Okay, here's where most people see the Maiden get good. They get real tight now, they get real \r\nfocused. Even if all Maiden albums sound practically the same, this could be considered their \r\nrevolutionary album, where everything falls into place. Right?<p>Wrong. Well, for me at least. Because here's where I see the Maiden getting...bad. See, this album \r\nhonestly could have been great, were it not for one animated little singer throwing himself into \r\nEVERYTHING. But what's really painful is that what's going on underneath Mister Dickinson is, for the \r\nmost part, brilliant. <p>Take the opening couple of numbers. Best song on the album's gotta be one of these two: \"Invaders\" is \r\njust a good ole Viking metal song, with that fantastic nautical internal riffage (love the chorus), and \r\nloads of blood, guts, gore, and energy, energy, energy to back it up. After that, the Maiden change \r\nthings around with the even better \"Children of the Damned.\" That medievally, acoustical intro is so \r\ncool, like you're gonna hear a folk song (for about a second), but later it evolves into another speedy \r\nheadbanger, and I have no qualms with that. <p>And, whatever, \"The Prisoner\" is actually okay. I mean, the verses are somewhat unmemorable, but \r\nthat chorus is pretty cool, as is the bridge and its subsequent soloing. And besides, I like that show. I \r\ncan dig it. However, \"22 Acacia Avenue,\" the so-called sequel to \"Charlotte the Harlot\" isn't all that \r\ngood. Like its predecessor, it's pretty dumb. But not as fun. Still headbang-able, if you care though. <p>\"The Number of the Beast\" has a spoken intro that, despite what your friends tell you, doesn't sound \r\nthat much like Vincent Price after a while. The rest of the infamous title track? Meh. Sorry, some of the \r\nsoloing is good, but it's just not much of a tune, I thought. And look, I know that \"Run to the Hills\" is \r\none of the band's biggest hits, but it's just so...stupid. There's no denying that the opening riff is \r\nbrilliant, but even if I could get past the trite lyrical matter, there's no excuse for the way ole Brucey \r\nbelts out the things. Wish I could shut that voice off<p>\"Gangland\" opens strong with the whole drum pattern thing, but it falls into another mediocre melody. \r\nThe bridge is cool though. \"Total Eclipse\" sounds like it could be something, but it's still kind of messy \r\nthrough and through. The faster sections lack cohesiveness, and the slower sections lack energy. I \r\ndunno. <p>Anyways, I guess \"Hallowed be thy Name\" is our epic. It's about a dude that dies at least. Dunno if \r\nthat's important, but I'm saying it. It basically follows the same pattern of \"Children of the Damned,\" \r\njust with more soloing. And, all things considered, it's a decent ending. In fact, yeah, it takes enough \r\ntwists and turns to be interesting (wish it lasted just a teeny bit long for that ending; or, wait, maybe it's \r\ntoo long. Crap, maybe it's fine). In fact, considering the strength of the album's opening and closing, if \r\nit weren't for Dickinson, I'd say this was a great lil' record. <p>Okay, so here's the deal. This is just as strong as any previous albums from a melodic point of view. \r\nAnd from a technical point of view. But it's just that, as the Maiden evolve, they loose \r\ntheir...uniqueness! And I, being the pompous ass who wasn't there that I am, proudly blame Dickinson. <p>Looky here. Di'Anno, despite what YOU think of him, gave the band something different. A 70's hard \r\nrock singer in an 80's metal band. Or thereabouts. Dickinson...just sounds like everyone else. Add to \r\nthat the sudden increase from here on out in goofy metallic things like demons and dragons and \r\npowerslaves (whatever those are); plus, the sound has changed drastically. I know that it was mutating \r\non the last album, but it's on Beast that I really hear that the raw power of the first album has all been \r\nreplaced with slick guitar noise. And, c'mon! The album covers themselves were never the same! Gone \r\nare the freaky Gothic send-ups, in come the sci-fi fantasies. Never again will the albums feel as cold to \r\nme...<p>But, singers again. It's not like Di'Anno never sang about stupid fantasy crap (\"Strange World?\"). It's \r\njust that when he DID, it always sounded weird and intriguing. Like, exactly how are we supposed to \r\nhandle \"Phantom of the Opera\" from him? But with Dickinson, there's no middle ground. Of COURSE \r\nthe song's about demons in bondage gear. See, I can imagine Di'Anno singing things like \"The Trooper\" \r\nand \"Invaders,\" believe it or not, whereas I CAN'T imagine Dickinson singing things like \"Prowler\" \r\nor \"Wrathchild.\" Can you? God, I hope not. You've just kicked my favorite 80's band in the balls then. <p>Okay, Dickinson aside, this album is pretty good, even if the numbers that didn't deserve to become \r\nclassic did (and I know that I'm really pickin' on Dickin' Son here, I'm sure it wasn't ALL his fault). The \r\nguitars are still awesomely played, the drums are still fast lil' metronomes, the bass is still Harris, and \r\nthere are a couple of choice riffs in there somewhere. Feel free to headbang to your heart's content. \r\nBesides, at this point, it's not like the Maiden could put out a bad album exactly. Just...somewhat \r\nuninspired. For the most part. </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176255#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=176255\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=176255\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, July 7, 2008</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #176255)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=10195\"><strong>Queen By-Tor</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=10195\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/10195/reefer-madness1.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>The album that turned us all into children of the damned</B> (well, the metal-heads, anyways).<p>Being one of the most influential and seminal albums ever to be released in the metal world it's a\r\nlittle bit weird to review it in the context of people who are looking for the next <I>Yes</I>. With\r\nthis album Iron Maiden would lose their first singer, Di'Anno, and would bring in one of the most\r\nknown pipes in all the land in the form of Bruce Dickinson - and although they hadn't completely\r\nmatured into their intelligent fantasy-metal type selves yet, they were definitely on that path. You\r\ncan still hear a large amount of Maiden's ''street sound'' on this album, but at least this time\r\nit's blended with a good amount of progressive influence, and even a few excellent tunes that the\r\nprogressive giants would have given them kudos for in the 70s. All in all, this may not be the place\r\nfor progheads to start with the band, but it's definitely one that should be on your buying list if\r\nyou like the band in any way, shape or form.<p>The best, most memorable tracks on the album (even in the metal world) are all ones that can be\r\ncalled progressive in nature. Take for example the metal behemoth, the amazing opus, <B>Hallowed Be\r\nThy Name</B>, something that even <I>Kansas</I> would have had trouble following during an act.\r\nEmotional, spine chilling, speed changing and guitar soloing greatness from start to finish, this\r\none is still a classic that gets performed to mass applause in ever single show that the beast plays\r\n- and for great reason. This is the ultimate standout on what is often called the most influential\r\nmetal album of all time. That said, there's other stuff of the disc that stands the test of time as\r\nwell. Take for instance the lengthy <B>22 Acacia Avenue</B>, which carries on the saga of 'Charlotte\r\nThe Harlot with a twisted and gruesome, sexually charged pseudo-epic, the lyrics of which could\r\nhave been written by Ian Anderson, although with more cynicism, and less humor. <B>Children Of The\r\nDamned</B> is an excellent and creepy song that makes the most out of its 4 minute time span while\r\n<B>Total Eclipse</B> seems like a two part suite forced into a short song format (and it works very\r\nwell). <p>The rest of the songs on the album were either hits or songs that metal-heads will proudly proclaim\r\nas their favorite Maiden tune. The quick and dirty opener, <B>Invaders</B> may not have any\r\n'progressive' merit, but who cares, really? How can you go wrong with a tune about vikings? <B>The\r\nPrisoner</B> is a lengthier piece that is more simple in composition than some of the other tracks,\r\nbut it's still effective with Harris's dominant bass playing taking control of the fray.\r\n<B>Gangland</B> is probably the least memorable of the bunch, but with a frantic rhythm section it's\r\nat least still a fun ride. Of course then we have the hits, a couple of the most played and\r\nmemorable tracks in the whole 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' scene. We all know <B>Run to the\r\nHills</B> and <B>Number Of The Beast</B> so there's no real point in going into great detail about\r\nthem, just sit back and enjoy.<p>So if you're into metal then buy this album and be happy with it - prog heads and especially the\r\nmore 'inclusive' proggers probably won't enjoy this one so much, let alone be convinced of the\r\nband's place on a website such as this. While this is considered their best moment by some it's more\r\nrightly considered the start of their classic era by others - later albums would become more and\r\nmore impressive, leaving this one in the dust, even if it is a monumental achievement. If you\r\nhaven't already checked out their later albums then do that first - this one gets 3.5 stars out of\r\n5. Excellent stuff, but the band did better.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=200068#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=200068\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=200068\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, January 21, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #200068)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25551\"><strong>snobb</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25551\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25551/psychiatrist.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt's a first Iron Maiden album ever I heard in my life (ok, somewhere in early eightees,still as \r\nLP), and I believe that it's one of the greatest album in rock ever.<p>In fact, I liked hard rock and heavy metal before, but in general it was very high energy, but \r\noften quite simple music. I liked some great bands as Pink Floyd of Supertramp as well, but \r\nthere wasn't enough \"heavyness\"in their sound. So, it was like living two lives ( in music) \r\nwithout strong connection between each other.<p>With that album situation started to change. For sure, it wasn't some serious difference at \r\nonce, but it was a beginning of long way of understanding, that heavy music could be \"proggy\".<p>Even now I don't believe too much that Iron Maiden has big relations with true progresive \r\nmusic. But for the time that album was released this small \"something\" was enough for the \r\ndifferent feeling of all music world.<p>The album as heavy metal ( or New Wave of British Heavy Metal, what is more correct) is \r\nabsolutely jam. Having all best atributes of that style ( heavyness, guitar riffs, really great Bruce \r\nDickinson vocal, melodies, bright compositions and good sound), it has some complexity in \r\nsound, more usual for heavy prog bands of that time. I think that is only \"prog\"component in it, \r\nbut it's enough for making this heavy metal album perfect work ( I think may be even the best \r\nband's album ever).</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=245076#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=245076\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=245076\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, October 17, 2009</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #245076)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25702\"><strong>Bonnek</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25702\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25702/kitty.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAfter their first two charming punk-metal albums, Iron Maiden replaced the rough bark of Paul\r\nDi'Anno by the operatic voice Bruce Dickinson. While I have no particular preference between both, I\r\nfeel that most of the material here would have been better suited for Di'Anno. Especially the simple\r\nhard-rock of the short songs misses that little rough edge that made Maiden so unique on the\r\nprevious album.<p>But this album also introduces a more epic writing style that might not have suited Di'Anno all that\r\nwell. Dickinson truly delivers on more dramatic songs like <em>Children of the Damned</em> and\r\n<em>Hallowed be Thy Name</em>.<p>Most of the material is rather average. Some of it below average. On <em>Invaders</em>, Dickinson\r\nstruggles to hit his high notes here, Halford would pulverize him on a song like this. <em>The\r\nPrisoner</em> is another weak song jumbling all known hard-rock clich\u00e9s together. It is a far cry\r\nfrom their previous uncompromising albums. <em>22, Acacia Avenue</em> and <em>Number of the Beast</em>\r\nare examples of songs that might have been more convincing with a bit more punk flavour. <em>Run To\r\nThe Hills</em> stands a good chance for being the most annoying hard rock anthem in rock history.\r\nOnly <em>Paradise By The Dashboard Light</em> is worse. There's also a song called <em>Gangland</em>\r\nthat is entirely forgettable.<p>The sound hasn't changed a bit compared to the previous album. The addition of Dickinson's power\r\nvocals make it sound almost exactly like Rainbow's sound on <em>Long Live Rock 'n' Roll</em>. Well\r\nit's a Martin Birch product so that makes sense. Apart from <em>Children of the Damned</em> and\r\n<em>Hallowed be Thy Name</em> this album is way too commercial and mediocre for my taste. 2.5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260049#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=260049\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=260049\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Saturday, January 9, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #260049)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=16579\"><strong>friso</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=16579\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/16579/bommel.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIron Maiden - The Number of the Beast (1982)<p>The creation of the metal-epic...<p>The beginning metal-scene had to progress quite a lot from heavy rock'n roll to the varied \r\nand inventive scene we know today. This album still stands as a landmark in the \r\ndevelopment of the genre. From now on heavy instrumentation, epical song-structures and \r\nemotionally developed songs could all be part of the same formula. That formula was \r\ncalled Iron Maiden.<p>Paul Di'Anno was fired because of his risky behavior and new lead singer Bruce Dickinson \r\n(ex-Samson) was to be the new front-man of the band. The vocal capabilities of Dickinson, \r\nthe metal instrumentation and the wish to expand the music became the foundation for the \r\nthird album of Iron Maiden. The album has songs of different sorts and the artistic approach \r\non the music made this a very likable album for proggers at the time. Some commercial \r\nmoments made the music accessible for the big public as Iron Maiden got their \r\ninternational fame in this period. <p>Invaders is a song that must have been intended for Di'Anno's voice. Dickinson tries to \r\nrecreate  the flamboyant up-tempo heavy rockin' style of first two Iron Maiden album and \r\nsucceeds. The songs has great parts, but I never really understood the way couplet and \r\nrefrain succeed each other. <p>Children of the Damned shows Iron Maiden in freshly discovered new grounds. The song \r\nhas an epical feel an extremely extrovert vocals of Dickinson. This emotional affair comes to \r\na zenith with an very touching end section. Great track!<p>The Prisoner has a more guitar-riff-like approach. This song isn't my favorite of the album, \r\nbut it still stands as a great metal track.<p>22 Acacia is yet another new experiment by Maiden. It continues the concept of whore \r\nCharlot the Harlot with a story-telling lyrical style. The introduction of the story of Bruce is sympathetic, but during the song his opinion about the 'service' of Charlot changed brilliantly \r\nand dramatically. The combination of this inventive lyrical (and instrumental) progress in the \r\nsong with the beautiful instrumentation makes this one of the best Iron Maiden tracks. Both \r\nguitar solo's are great as well. <p>The Number of the Beast is yet another story-telling lyrical track with yet some more \r\ninstrumental exploration. The ever important bass-lines of Harris are great and the guitar \r\nsolo's perfect. This song get's me moving, great metal!<p>Run to the Hills represents the commercial part of the album. Still the song has a great \r\nlyrics about the killing of all the Indians in North America. It's a nice song and nothing more.<p>Gangland is a song with an atmospheric approach. As the title suggest, the song has a \r\ndark sound that perfectly fit with the lyrics about a dark society with killers on every corner of \r\nthe street. The drums and the main guitar riff are strong and the vocals are great. Somehow \r\nthis song is a lonely track in Maiden discography: it just doesn't sound like other tracks. \r\nGreat!<p>Total Eclipse was a b-side intended for our Japanese amigo's who had to spend a lot of \r\nmoney on European music and thus deserved a bonus track. The song has less \r\nsophisticated themes, but still has an interesting structure and the apocalyptic lyrics are \r\nnice.<p>Hallowed be thy Name. This is the one metal epic. This track alone is a ground-braking \r\naffair and one of the most inspiring metal tracks ever! The dark atmospheres, the great \r\ninstrumental guitar parts, the progress during the song, the heart-aching vocals of \r\nDickinson.. all are great. The song moved me when I was 12 years old and I still thinks just \r\nas brilliant to day. Iron Maiden is here to stay!<p>Conclusion. An album with lot's of amazing moments, whilst changing the style of the band \r\nquite a bit. Still this is not like a 'transitional' album, this is Iron Maiden arriving in a new era. \r\nA lot of songs have a special place in my hearth because of the emotional and extrovert \r\nvocals of Dickinson and the amazing instrumental parts. The innovative song-writing of Iron \r\nMaiden made them one of the best acts of the eighties for sure. Four stars!<p>* Listening to this album on high volume reminded me this was a true masterpiece of heavy metal. Five stars.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284299#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=284299\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=284299\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Monday, May 31, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #284299)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=25731\"><strong>EatThatPhonebook</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=25731\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/25731/anno-domini-high-definiti&#111;n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWith Iron Maiden's third album, the mature sound starts coming. With this release the band once again revolutionizes heavy metal \r\nsound, thanks to the entry of Bruce Dickinson, considered even today one of the best metal vocalists. The sound is generally \r\nheavier, the guitars are more violent, the rhythms more strong and at times faster. But there is also an impressive songwriting, \r\nespecially in songs like Run To The Hills and the title track, which became unbelievable classics not only for Iron Maiden but even \r\nfor metal generally speaking. <p>The album starts with \"Invaders\" a short but effective song, fast and violent, with Bruce's high pitched vocals and Steve Harris' \r\nincredible performance.k<p>\"Children Of The Damned\" is a ballad, pretty good for Iron Maiden standards but it's probably the weakest moment of the album.<p>\"The Prisoner\" is a longer song, fast like Invaders, that surely influenced Trash metal in a way. One of my favorites.<p>\"22 Acacia Avenue\" is another fabulous piece, almost perfect, even this has pretty much the same structure as the previous song.<p>the title track is a huge heavy metal classic, for sure one of the best songs of the genre. For this song in particular the band was \r\naccused of Satanism. <p>\"Run o The Hills\" is another classic. Thanks to it's unusual rhythm and epic moods, it became the most famous Maiden song. <p>\" Gangland\" is an interesting song, very different, not so catchy as the previous songs, but still great. <p>\"Hallowed By Thy Name\" is yet another classic, very haunting and powerful, a semi ballad that can scare or give joy, an \r\nunforgettable song that no Maiden fan doesn't like. <p>In conclusion, I must say it's one of the most terrific metal albums I've ever heard, very underrated in this site, but highly acclaimed by \r\nthe rest of the world. Essential.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=285187#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=285187\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=285187\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 6, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #285187)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=23199\"><strong>Dobermensch</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=23199\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/23199/me.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nIt's funny: every year that passes makes old Iron Maiden albums sound softer and more mainstream. \r\nAt the time this was released I remember huddling round an old cassette player in my school playground in mid-summer '82 and being genuinely scared by this album'. Now that I've just turned 40 it sounds really cheesy and tacky - just like the front cover looks. <p>I still quite like the intro \"Invaders' though, and 'Ganglands' is pretty cool. Other than that it's a lot of old pants. The rest of the tunes all sort of morph into one in your mind after you've finished listening to the whole thing - as they're basically all the same. <p>I'm not calling into question the band's musicianship which was undoubtedly top notch - but doesn't Bruce Dickinson have the most one dimensional 'operatic' voice you've ever heard? He's the Sean Connery of singing - he's had year after year to improve, alter  or modify and basically just sounds the same now as he always did, still using the same old gimmicks. Still - at least he's had a haircut.\r\n'Killers' was a far better album with better vocals and more diversity and was the best Iron Maiden album in my opinion.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=287540#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=287540\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=287540\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, June 20, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #287540)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20315\"><strong>AtomicCrimsonRush</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20315\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20315/193865958928950047_klmILX3L_b.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nMy first official Metal album. I was into the glam metal of The Sweet and Kiss and so it was \r\nonly a natural progression that I would try some of the harder stuff. I saw Iron Maiden on TV \r\nplaying 'Number of the Beast' with that crazy film clip, and awesome lead break, I was totally in \r\nawe of this new band. I bought the vinyl record and raced home to put it on. <p>Soon I was being assaulted by the blistering breakneck speed of 'Invaders'. I had never heard \r\nanything so fast or brutal and I had to check my pulse as I think my heart was racing as fast as \r\nBurr's crashing drumbeat. I had to check the lyrics sheet as I couldn't even keep up with \r\nDickinson's vocals. The lyrics are about Viking Norsemen raping, pillaging and killing \r\neveryone. OK, this is metal. I played the song over and over until it was a blood transfusion into \r\nmy veins that I still have today. Every word was memorised, every lead break on this album \r\ningrained into my conscious, it was essentially the beginning of my metal obssession. As \r\nsuch, this album is so important to me. <p>Each track brings back incredible memories even today. Due to my Christian beliefs I cannot \r\nlisten anymore to the title track, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying 'The Prisoner', 'Run to \r\nthe Hills' or 'Children of the Damned'. Murray and Smith's guitar duels are incredible and they \r\nare a joy to watch on stage.<p>I love the killer riffs of power metal and Dickinson's screaming 'Air Raid Siren' vocals. He \r\nburies Paul Di'Anno for sheer volume and power, and he is the only Maiden vocalist for me. \r\nThe last track is a tour de force of atmosphere and building dread, one of the greatest Maiden \r\ntracks that the band still play live. 'Run to the Hills'; became an unlikely single and the clip with \r\nvintage Western footage is fun and shows the band were not taking themselves too seriously. \r\nOverall this album is an essential purchase. I do not like the album cover as it is puerile and \r\njuvenile by today's standards, but in it's day this was the one to get hold of; the music is simply \r\nawesome, changing the face of metal forever! As far as prog rock goes there is little on offer \r\nhere, so only 3 stars for me in the prog realm, but its a 4 star metal album. Come on you \r\nIrons!  </strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289803#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=289803\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=289803\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Friday, July 9, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #289803)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=20672\"><strong>J-Man</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=20672\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/20672/10363795_667676003270041_3933815434573087984_n.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>Revelations Ch. XIII V. 18</B><p><em>The Number of the Beast</em> marked a significant change for Iron Maiden. First of all, you have\r\nthe entrance of Bruce Dickinson, \"Air Raid Siren\", on vocals, and second you have an international\r\nsuccess and one of the most iconic and influential albums in heavy metal. Yes, you could call <em>The\r\nNumber of the Beast</em> one of the most groundbreaking albums in metal, but it is certainly not\r\nwithout reason. This album is fantastic and marks the first in a long string of Dickinson classics.\r\nMany people would call <em>The Number of the Beast</em> the best Iron Maiden album, and even though I\r\ndon't entirely agree with this, it would be pure blasphemy to call it anything less than\r\nquintessential and just simply awesome.<p>This album has a slightly different sound than the first two Iron Maiden full-lengths, mostly due to\r\nBruce Dickinson's vocal prowess. Gone are the punk-laden vocals of Paul Di'Anno, replaced by the\r\nmasterful heavy metal vocals of Bruce Dickinson. As you can imagine, the very different style of the\r\ntwo vocalists greatly impacted Iron Maiden's sound. The punk-ish sound of the first two albums is\r\ngone almost entirely, and in replacement is a more traditional heavy metal sound. <em>The Number of\r\nthe Beast</em> also introduces the galloping basslines and high falsetto vocals that Iron Maiden is\r\nknown for. However, the band had yet to fully unleash their prog side by the time of this album. The\r\nprog influences are still scarce on this album, but within the next two albums that would change\r\ndrastically. The only proggy song on this release is the mini-epic <em>Hallowed Be Thy Name</em>.\r\nOtherwise, this album is heavy metal with little variation outside of that genre.<p><em>The Number of the Beast</em> is an 8-track, 40:20 album. Although another 5 to 10 minutes would've\r\nbeen nice, this is a generally good length for a heavy metal album. There is very little filler\r\nhere, and the only song short of excellent is <em>Gangland</em>. The other songs are all masterpieces\r\nof heavy metal. <em>Children of the Damned</em>, <em>The Prisoner</em>, <em>22 Acacia Avenue</em>, and\r\n<em>Hallowed Be Thy Name</em> are my personal favorites, but songs like <em>The Number of the Beast</em>\r\nand <em>Run to the Hills</em> are unquestionable classics. Needless to say this album is all killer\r\nand (almost) no filler. Some of Iron Maiden's best material can be found here.<p>As with all Iron Maiden albums, the musicianship is some of the best out there. Every single\r\nbandmate is extremely talented, and they always play exceptionally well together. As mentioned, this\r\nis the first album with Bruce Dickinson behind the microphone, and what a debut with Iron Maiden\r\nthis was! The man is just a fantastic singer, among the best in all of heavy metal. Steve Harris'\r\nbass playing is also another highlight here. Iron Maiden is one of the few metal bands who really\r\nemphasizes on their bass player, giving Harris more than enough room to shine through with his talent.<p>The production on <em>The Number of the Beast</em> is perfect. This is among the best heavy metal\r\nproductions ever. It's powerful, clean, and the bass is high in the mix (something I usually really\r\nlike). It doesn't come as much of a surprise, though, considering how great Iron Maiden's production\r\nqualities usually are. Martin Birch is simply one of the best producers during this time period.<p><B>Conclusion:</B><p><em>The Number of the Beast</em> is one of the most influential albums in heavy metal, and after\r\nhearing it many times, it's not hard to understand why. Calling this album incredible is nothing\r\nshort of the truth. Consider how many metal musicians, now legends in their own right, cite <em>The\r\nNumber of the Beast</em> as a major musical influence. How many albums do you know that can fit a\r\nlabel like that? I'm going to give <em>The Number of the Beast</em> a 4 star rating. I would've gone\r\nhigher, but decided not to because Iron Maiden made even better albums in their future. Still, this\r\nalbum is a must-have for all metalheads.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=293010#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=293010\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=293010\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, August 1, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #293010)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=15960\"><strong>CCVP</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=15960\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/15960/130464717833.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<strong>Possibly the best Maiden has to offer</strong><p>I am not a huge maiden fan. In fact, I didn't cared much about them untill around mid 2008, when a\r\nlocal record store chain, due to finantial problems, had to close its doors. In the months before\r\nthey did so, they effortfully tried to sell whatever there was left in the stores, even selling CDs\r\nfro less than half the price, and I did whatever I could to grab as many albums as I could in such\r\nneat deals.<p>At that time, I acquired most of Iron Maiden's discography without knowing much about them, but as I\r\nlistened to their albums I slowly understood their fame, and Number of the Beast is a pivotal part\r\nof getting such importance in the heavy metal world.<p>The first album with the then new singer Bruce Dickinson proved to be a reboot for the band, becuse\r\nthey significantly changed their sound, that now was much more well worked, developed and composed\r\nand had a marked epic feeling to it, which was significantly caused by Bruce's operatic voice allied\r\nwith a more elaborate guitar work. <p>At this point, however, the band still retained much of their visceral sound from their two earlier\r\nalbums, influenced by punk rock to some extent, what puts Number of the Beast as a transition album\r\nfor the band, but transformed it in one of the main albums of the New Wave of Brittish Heavy Metal\r\nbecause of that uncommon mix of epic metal music and visceral, simple and straight to the point\r\nrock. That caused the album to be one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all time to the\r\npoint that the way the song are organized in Number became one of the blueprints of metal albums.<p>Although many consider Iron Maiden's albums from the latter part of the 80's to be their best, I\r\npersonally think that this is actually their best album. The music by itself is very good: it is\r\nvery concise, precise, it isn't overdone, something that the band recurringly did on following\r\nalbums, resulting in things such as Bruce trying to go beyond his singing range or screaming instead\r\nof delivering a clear note or having messy guitar solos. Also, their transition phase, between their\r\n<em>straightforward</em> and <em>epic</em> style is able to deliver everything it is supposed to with\r\nperfection, something the other band's albums failed, in a way or another, making the whole\r\nexperience much more enjoyable. It is also important to point out that the production here is very\r\nwell done: all instruments sound evenly, everybody gets his bit of space and nobody shines more than\r\nhe rightfully should.<p><em>Grade and Final Thought</em><p>I seriously cannot find a flaw in Number of the Beast. Add to that the fact that it is one of the\r\nmost influential and important albums in the heavy metal history. The only logical result here is to\r\ngive the perfect grade.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=344348#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=344348\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=344348\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Sunday, December 5, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #344348)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=12042\"><strong>Finnforest</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=12042\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/12042/FINNFOREST.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/3stars.gif\" alt=\"3 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\n<B>Metal legend yes, but not so fast</B><p>\"The Number of the Beast\" is a notable album for the band showing off the new vocalist and for many\r\nfans it was a favorite.  I'll be brief: much of the album has that punkish energy and is able to\r\nmerge that energy into often infectious grooves, certainly fare for getting those neck-muscles\r\nloosened up.  But even if I look past Dickinson's oft-silly howling and the sometimes juvenile\r\nthemes/imagery there is trouble in Beast-town.  While the songs possess that important energy most\r\nof them ultimately slip into this repetitive, mid-range buzz, which begins to blow the boredom\r\nspores in your direction.  Add this to the thin-sounding guitars and the less-than-soulful sections\r\nand it doesn't grip often enough.  There are some cool moments: the title track is a punchy classic\r\nand there is a moving solo during \"22, Acacia Ave\" which has this nasty-good early Rush-like backing\r\npart behind it....more moments in this vein would have helped overall.  Some of those slower Dio-ish\r\nstyled fantasy sections are nice as well, a needed break from the \"Beast\" treadmill pace.  <p>As an aside, hopefully the album has turned on some people to the excellent \"The Prisoner\"\r\ntelevision series from the 1960s.  \"Number\" is decent album, a bit under 3 stars for me, but one\r\nthat admittedly has a large following who love it.  \r\n</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=367736#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=367736\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=367736\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Wednesday, December 29, 2010</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #367736)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=390\"><strong>Rune2000</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>SPECIAL COLLABORATOR</strong> <em>H&#111;norary Collaborator</em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=390\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/390/rune3000.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/2stars.gif\" alt=\"2 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nConsidered by many to be the masterpiece of their career, <em>The Number Of The Beast</em> was definitely the album that lunched Iron Maiden's career into stardom and made Bruce Dickinson an overnight sensation. But although most of us are well familiar with singles like <em>The Number Of The Beast</em> and <em>Run To The Hills</em>, what does the remainder of the album actually have to offer to the yet unconvinced audiences? Let's listen and find out!<p>\r\n<em>Invaders</em> starts off this album with an upbeat intro and Bruce Dickinson quickly takes his chance to showcase his amazing vocal abilities. Other than that, this is clearly one of the least impressive album openers in Iron Maiden's history due to the song's very generic structure. This fact is actually given away pretty early on considering the clich\u00e9 title of the composition. <em>Invaders</em> is just such a typical Heavy Metal song title; Judas Priest showcased their spectacular <em>Invader</em> on the 1978 record <em>Stained Class</em> while Magnum featured a grand scale <em>Invasion</em> on their debut album from that same year. In short, Iron Maiden was at least 4 years behind in that regard.<p>\r\nLuckily, they managed to beat Metallica to a pulp with the intro riff to <em>Children Of The Damned</em>! The rest of the song is solid tribute to the Dio-era Black Sabbath, although some would consider it a rip off considering that both bands were still active in 1982. <em>The Prisoner</em> is the first unmistakably Iron Maiden sounding composition which will pave the way for many similar songs for years to come. I really have no idea what to say about <em>22 Acacia Avenue</em>... this song starts like a typical Iron Maiden composition but the chorus line just makes me cringe every time I hear it. It's good to know that the band wouldn't try to recreate this type of composition throughout the rest of the '80s.<p>\r\nWhat can I say about the album's title track that haven't been said already? How about the fact that this song was my main reason for rejecting Maiden for many years after I heard it back in my early teens! I mean, this is just such an irritatingly cheesy track that makes me think more of a weird Halloween masquerade than the actual chilling story that is being portrayed in the lyrics. This is one of the two Iron Maiden tracks for the '80s that gets the skip button treatment the most by me whenever I listen to these albums (patience, the second one will be revealed pretty soon). <em>Run To The Hills</em> might be just as overplayed as it's predecessor but at least this track manages to achieve the title of being the quintessential Iron Maiden tune which manages to combine pretty much all the distinguishable qualities within their work. I'm talking about Dickinson's soaring vocals, Harris' stomping bass, Smith/Murray dual guitar action, rather bland drumming and let's not forget those ridiculous lyrics!<p>\r\n<em>Gangland</em> is another pretty forgettable track that is saved by the dual guitar action, other than that it's just too bland for my taste. <em>Total Eclipse</em> isn't really any better, even though I do enjoy that guitar riff a whole lot more. <em>Hallowed Be Thy Name</em> is easily the biggest highlight of the bunch, unfortunately even this track loses some of it's momentum after you hear the main guitar riff gets repeated a few too many times. Other than that, this is an excellent piece of music which incidentally began the tradition of featuring an epic composition at the end of each album all the way to <em>Somewhere In Time</em>, or maybe even <em>Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son</em> since it's actually considered one long concept album by some.<p>\r\nI've written more than I should have about this album since I don't really hate it as much as some of my remarks would suggest. The fact is I just never cared much neither for or against it. I guess I can see why the fans like it - there are a lot of big hits here and the rest of the songs can probably grow on the listener with time. Since I really never have given <em>The Number Of The Beast</em> that much time, I'll just never understand it. Who knows, maybe it's all for the better in the long run?<p>**** star songs: Children Of The Damned (4:35) The Prisoner (6:04) Run To The Hills (3:54) Hallowed Be Thy Name (7:14)<p>*** star songs: Invaders (3:25) 22 Acacia Avenue (6:37) Gangland (3:48) Total Eclipse (4:26)<p>** star songs: The Number Of The Beast (4:52)</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=548543#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=548543\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=548543\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, October 11, 2011</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #548543)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17723\"><strong>Warthur</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"avatarhp-box\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=17723\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/uploads/17723/marilli&#111;n-brave.jpg\" class=\"avatarhp\" width=100 onerror=\"this.src='/forum/avatars/blank_avatar.jpg'\" />\r\n</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/5stars.gif\" alt=\"5 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nWith the mighty Bruce Dickinson signing on, Iron Maiden finally had a vocalist capable of \r\nhandling the complex material Steve Harris and the others had wanted to compose but had \r\nheld back on during the Paul Di'Anno era.

Graced with some of the band's most recognizable songs, \r\n'Number Of The Beast' lays down a foundation for all of the Maiden work to come. With \r\ngalloping rhythms, acrobatic vocals, aggressive speed and relative lyrical sophistication, \r\nMaiden's third album is a great place to start with this band's illustrious career.<p>As part of the NWOBHM (New Wave Of British Heavy Metal) movement, Iron Maiden has a \r\nvery signature sound to them here, one that's likely already indelibly etched into many a \r\nmetalhead's mind. Twin-harmony guitars and a rhythm section that achieves a rolling \r\npattern, akin to the galloping of a horse, are the two distinguishing traits of the band's \r\nmusic.  Although these songs are quite catchy, there is a technical sense to the riffs. Speed \r\nmetal is obviously a factor here, although it's used moderately enough for the music to be \r\nmelodic and memorable. The two most famous tracks off the record are the title track, and \r\nthe crowd pleaser 'Run To The Hills'; a song that features everything that fans love about \r\nMaiden. Here, the lyrics revolve around European conquest of the New World; an ambitious \r\ntopic in comparison to the bawdy 'sex and drugs and sex' themes that many metal bands of \r\nthe time were into.<p>Iron Maiden had been a capable act with singer Paul Di'Anno, but Bruce Dickinson's voice \r\nreally brings the band's sound to a new level of distinction. He is one of those singers who \r\nmanages to impress in a lower range, as well as a blistering falsetto. The epic closer and \r\nhighlight 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' is most indicative of this. Beginning quite slowly, Bruce is \r\nable to set the scene of a dark holding cell, then raises the intensity as it becomes clear that \r\nthe protagonist is doomed to be executed. Iron Maiden's sense of refined aggression is \r\nmatched perfectly with this dark subject matter, although there are certainly more upbeat \r\nmoments on the record, such as the tongue-in-cheek '22 Acacia Avenue'.<p>'Number Of The Beast' really is a perfect place to start with Iron Maiden, even more so than \r\nany best-of compilation. Although I think the quality of music would get higher as they tread \r\ntowards more progressive domains, the classic quality and consistent songwriting makes \r\nthis album a winner.</strong></strong></em></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"review-footer\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=623328#social-comments\" class=\"icon-socialcomments\"><fb:comments-count href=\"http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=623328\"></fb:comments-count> social review comments</a> <img src=\"static-images/new2.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></strong> | <a href=\"Review.asp?id=623328\"  class=\"icon-permalink\">Review Permalink</a><br />\r\n<span class=\"icon-date\">Posted Tuesday, January 31, 2012</span> | <a href=\"album.asp?id=12928#postAReview\" class=\"icon-post\">Review this album</a> | <a href=\"https://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=28343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"icon-report\">Report</a> (Review #623328)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin:0px 10px 20px 0px;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:5px;100%\">\r\nReview by\r\n\r\n<a href=\"Collaborators.asp?id=17216\"><strong>Sinusoid</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<br><font color=\"#dc143c\"><strong>PROG REVIEWER</strong> <em></em></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color:#333;margin-top:5px;\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"static-images/4stars.gif\" alt=\"4 stars\" border=\"0\">\r\nAnd the metalheads rejoice?<p>It took a bit of time before I really understood this album.  It has among the best batch of riffs\r\nthat got streamlined into palpable song material.  Thanks to punk, Iron Maiden was already a big\r\ncult phenomenon (I think a lot of people were sick of punk at the time), but NUMBER OF THE BEAST was\r\nprobably the album that made most of the general public take notice.<p>And the notice mostly came about due to extreme reactions to the title track, which as I understand\r\nit, is about someone bumping into a Satanic cult.  The controversy has always been overblown, but it\r\ndoesn't help when the phrase ''666; the number of the beast'' is shouted ad nauseam in each chorus.\r\n Musically, it does a good pasting job with the riffs; it climaxes from the beginning and going from\r\none riff to the next is smooth.<p>I think it was AFTER I had realized how much of a metalhead I really was, was when I really enjoyed\r\nthe album.  ''Invaders'' often gets discarded as the crappiest track when the only problem I find\r\nwith it is that it doesn't quite work as the opener (I prefer ''Number of the Beast''). \r\n''Gangland'' and ''22 Acacia Avenue'' are other tracks that got stuck in my head despite the general\r\nconsensus that they're filler.  It's all in the riff.  The batch here keeps you on your toes, almost\r\na thrash-fest before the concept of thrash metal existed.<p>But here's the big question for this site; what does this album have to do with prog?  A couple of\r\nbits, actually.  The penultimate ending ''Hallowed Be Thy Name'' is near universally praised for the\r\nepic heights it achieves (and it seems to channel Kansas for some reason), and the platitudes are\r\nwell deserved.

On their third album IRON MAIDEN\r\nblossomed into a formidable heavy metal act with the addition of Dickinson's operatic vocals at just\r\nthe right time as the band was becoming more progressive and the music more demanding and now they\r\ncould pursue the directions that bassist and main songwriter Steve Harris had been hoping for. Eddie\r\nearned his right to hang out with Satan after all that killing he did on the last album with a bit\r\nof a mystery since he is controlling Satan like a puppet who in turn is controlling a smaller\r\nversion of him thus symbolizing the paradox of dominance.<p>THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST is a power-packed heavy metal masterpiece that achieves perfection from the\r\nvery first crunchy power chord of 'Invaders' to the the chiming bells and operatic dual guitar\r\nonslaught of 'Hallowed Be Thy Name.' The band continues their tradition of mixing their punkish\r\naggression with melodic progressive metal with themes that were inspired by movies, fiction and\r\nphilosophy. They succeeded in developing a diverse collection of well-crafted songs that made this\r\nalbum an instant classic becoming one of the most popular metal albums of all time. The re-mastered\r\nversion contains the song 'Total Eclipse' before the finale 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' which was\r\noriginally the B-side for  the 'Run To The Hills' single.<p>This would be the last album with drummer Clive Burr (and the only one on which he contributed his\r\nsongwriting skills) who was fired from the band during The Beast On The Road tour apparently for\r\nbeing unreliable and letting his partying affect his stage performance testifying to the high and\r\nprofessional standards of this band. He would ironically (or ironmaidenically) switch places with\r\nhis replacement Nicko McBrain in the group Trust and also had a short gig with the supergroup\r\nGogmagog which also included Paul Di'Anno and future MAIDEN guitarist Janick Gers. Mr. Burr was\r\nsadly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis shortly thereafter and died in 2013 from complications.\r\nR.I.P.
