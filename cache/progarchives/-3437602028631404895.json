  "biography": "Peter Hammill biography\n\nPeter Joseph Andrew Hammill\n\n- Born 5 November 1948 (Ealing, West London, England)\n\nPeter HAMMILL is one of the most unique and influential voices in prog. He was the pivotal figure in VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR (VDGG for short) who formed in 1967 at Manchester University. His obsession with lost love, lost faith, time, space and existence itself are the cornerstones of both his work with the band and his solo albums. He was also their principle songwriter.  The classic line-up was the HAMMILL, Banton, Jaxon, Evans combo which produced the peak \"Pawn Hearts\", \"Still Life\" and \"Godbluff\" albums. He has since brought out at least 30 solo albums, marked by lyrics of the utmost insight (usually) and a total refusal to compromise. Their complex music, as often brutal as it was lyrical, fitted somewhat uneasily into the once and then niche of Progressive Rock. An interesting figure whose albums certainly merit investigation..!\n\nThe first of a classic trilogy in progressive rock history, \"Chameleon\"... and its companion pieces \"The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage\" and \"In Camera\", are as good if not better than many of the VDGG albums. FOR FANS OF PETER HAMMILL...!\n\nSee also:\n\n-\n\nVan Der Graaf Generator\n\n-\n\nThe Long Hello\n\n-\n\nIsildurs Bane",
