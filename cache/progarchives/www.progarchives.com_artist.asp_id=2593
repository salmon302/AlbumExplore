<strong>Wolverine biography</strong><br />
<span id="shortBio">Hailing from Soderhamn, Sweden, WOLVERINE was formed in 1995 by Stefan ZELL (bass, vocals) and Marcus LOSBJER (drums, backing vocals) as a melodic death metal band. They were soon joined by Stefan's younger brother Mikael (guitar), followed by Andreas BAGLIEN (keyboards, organ) and Carl-Henrik LANDEGREN (guitar) as their sound evolved into melodic progressive metal with accompanying growling vocals.  Following the recording of 3 demos during the late '90s ("Land of the Midnight Sun (96), "North" (97) & Unnamed (97)), they self-released their fourth as a 5 track EP, entitled "Fervent Dream" (1999), which was critically well received, leading to its re-issue as a digi-pack, re-mastered with two bonus tracks in 2001. The summer of 1999 saw the band play gigs in their native Sweden, besides an invitation to perform as the opening band at ProgPower Europe, on the strength of the material from the EP alone.<br><br>During summer 2001, the band travelled to Germany to record their debut studio album, "The Window Purpose" (2001) by which time, guitarist LANDEGREN had left the band, to be replaced by Per BRODDESSEN, while second bassist Thomas JANSSON was later added to free Stefan ZELL up for some of the vocal passages. Their debut, through LOSBJER's occasional growling vocals and ZELL's heavier guitar work continued to bear traces of their death metal legacy besides traces of a 'PAIN OF SALVATION' influence alongside the new progressive/ post metal direction they were now taking. Critically acclaimed, "The Window Purpose" caught the ear of Elitist records, who signed the band to a potential four-album deal, while more concerts followed, including a support slot for ANATHEMA in London.<br><br>Their sophomore album "Cold Light of Monday" (2004) saw the band take a considerably darker turn both musically and lyrically. The sombre, emotionally filled tone-colour portrayed in the songs aptly underscores the album's central concept, which tells the story of a young abused woman, Sarah, during a critical time in her life:  "A shivering girl sits all alone upon a cold floor in a filthy apartment. All that keeps her company are the sounds of the city's evening traffic coming through the only window. The radiators produce a haunting symphony of sounds that sends shivers down her spine. Her face and body are bruised and battered. She looks like some sort of twisted artwork with her blood running down her pale skinny legs. She's trying to remember how she ended up here.

The sombre, emotionally filled tone-colour portrayed in the songs aptly underscores the album's central concept, which tells the story of a young abused woman, Sarah, during a critical time in her life:  "A shivering girl sits all alone upon a cold floor in a filthy apartment. All that keeps her company are the sounds of the city's evening traffic coming through the only window. The radiators produce a haunting symphony of sounds that sends shivers down her spine. Her face and body are bruised and battered. She looks like some sort of twisted artwork with her blood running down her pale skinny legs. She's trying to remember how she ended up here. Where did it all go wrong? Trying to remember, and yes, finally finding the beginning of it all".  With the subsequent songs reflecting on the journey Sarah has taken, the music shows a departure from the band's previous material, showcasing a growing depth and maturity in their song writing which has become one of the band's hallmarks. <br><br>After splitting with Elitist Records in 2005 the band signed to Candlelight Records, who released their third album, "Still" (2006). Prior to entering the studios however, WOLVERINE witnessed the departure of keyboardist Andreas BAGLIEN after 8 years as a member of the band, to be replaced by Per HENRIKSSON.  The album, which had been recorded at the Spacelab Studio, Germany during the summer of 2005, tended toward a blend of their previous offerings; atmospherically powerful, emotionally laden with melancholy moods and subtle nuances. Although Mikael ZELL's harder edged guitar evidences a heavier offering than its predecessor, the combination of his riffing style set against the melodic backdrop of HENRIKSSON's keys, suggest the band's sound being nudged in the direction of RIVERSIDE and ANATHEMA.<br><br>'Complicated' personal issues came to the fore during 2007/8 which almost brought the band to a halt; however the process of song writing was renewed and material was gradually put together for what would eventually become "Communication Lost" (2011), the band's fourth full studio effort. The album was recorded in various locations around Sweden during early 2010, mixed by Jacob HANSEN in Denmark and finally released through Candlelight Records in May. According to Marcus LOSBJER, the album is the natural evolution and continuation from "Still", the songs being structurally more complex, with electronic elements and effects being utilised to help create the desired atmosphere. Critics have commented on the album benefitting from high quality of production, with a wide dynamic range. <br><br>After the release, the decision was made to part ways with Candlelight Records as it was felt they weren't the best vehicle for the band's music. Afterwards, Mikael ZELL, who it was believed wasn't as focussed on the music as he had once been, left the band, to be replaced by Jonas JONSSON, a long-time friend of the band, in December 2012. The new line up spent much of 2013 writing material for a fifth studio album and getting reinstated on the concert circuit, which included ProgPower USA and a gig in Tel Aviv; the first occasions the band had played outside Europe.<br><br>Stylistically, WOLVERINE's origins were on the fringes of the melodic doom/ death metal sphere and as such, their early releases may please fans of Scandinavian bands as diverse as GREEN CARNATION, PAIN OF SALVATION, OPETH & KATATONIA. Lyrically, their socially aware material has tended to concentrate on subjects surrounding everyday life, relationships and depression; however their sound evolved toward a more progressive/ post metal vibe. Greater use of subdued guitars and an increased dynamic range has engendered an atmosphere to their material, which would also appeal to fans of ANATHEMA (who have undoubtedly influenced them), RIVERSIDE, NOVEMBRE & PORCUPINE TREE.<br><br>Studio Albums: "The Window Purpose" (2001), "Cold Light of Monday" (2004), "Still" (2006), "Communication Lost" (2011)<br><br>Present Members:<br><br>Stefan ZELL: Clean vocals<br>Mikael ZELL: Electric guitar<br>Thomas JANSSON: Bass guitar<br>Marcus LOSBJER: Drums, percussion, death vocals<br>Per HENRIKSSON:  Keyboards<br><br>Biography by Jared<br></span><a href="javascript:showFullBio();" id="aMoreLink"><strong>read more</strong></a>

'A Darkened Sun', a well sought out title. Here we have a WOLVERINE mini album, offered in a rather uncommon manner. They have chosen the form of a music video with round about 28 minutes running time. Comprised of four chapters, each covered by one song. That said, for what I know, neither a physical release in vinly or CD format is planned, nor a regular digital album for download purposes. Hence I had to place a donation via PayPal, the sole possibility to financially support this production. Worth the money, my recommendation. Four years ago the prior highly acclaimed regular album 'Machina Viva' appeared to the scene as quite a big hit. WOLVERINE are able to follow up on their predecessor, that's for sure. <p>The line up hasn't changed, magnificent lead singer Stefan Zell is ruling, still. He has one of the most impressing voices when it comes to the progressive rock realm. Melancholy pure! The visual aspect, well, technically, artistically demanding in fact. To be honest, maybe call me ignorant, I can't get much from the overall pessimistic dark mooded scenes. Of course this somehow corresponds to the lyrics,  and finally the sound also. Anyway, for me the music as such strikes, that counts, comes first. At best when I put my headphones on, close my eyes, letting my own mental cinema running free. Seems to be contradictive, you may say. But it works for me, simply fantastic. <p>And so, similar to 'Our Last Goodbye' they admittedly are providing a rather Doom drenched entry into this effort, though the instruments will unfold soon after with alternating ebb and flow. <strong>The Breach</strong> showcases hard working sawing metal guitar riffs complementing the rhythm branch. More mellowness, the soulful <strong>Dead As The Moon</strong> can be seen as the album's centerpiece for good reason. 'Help Me, Save Me!' - expressing some forward looking positive vibe the groovy <strong>Hibernator</strong> then closes this sonic adventure. Great emotional music in any case! So hopefully this is more than solely a mandatory sign of life. So much the more the necessary intermediate step while indicating to a follower, a new full-fledged studio album. Please go ahead.

This is album of the year for me. For those of you who haven't heard of Wolverine, they're a prog rock/metal band 
from Sweden who create moody music in the style of bands like Riverside, Porcupine Tree, Votum, Katatonia, etc.<p>They've been going for quite a while now and I originally discovered them in 2006 when one of their songs, 'A House 
of Plague', was featured on a free CD with Classic Rock Magazine. They should have made a breakthrough then with 
their album 'Still' which was a perfect balance of heavy and commercial prog metal songwriting but unfortunately it 
wasn't to be. They didn't release anything further until five years later in 2011 with 'Communication Lost'. That album 
was very different. The songwriting was more mature and the music a lot mellower and bleaker. With the inclusion of 
string quartets and lengthier compositions, it was a complex yet rewarding concept album that sadly went by largely 
unnoticed by anyone. Following that, the band seemingly disappeared into the void, until this year.<p>Another five year gap has proven to be well worth the wait with 'Machina Viva', their finest album to date. It's very 
much a continuation of the style found on 'Communication Lost' but the songs here are more instantly accessible and 
the concept a little more focused. The production and musicianship, as with all their albums, is fantastic. All prog fans 
should check this out. It's hard to pick a favourite song because they're all so moving and memorable. I think I will 
have to highlight 'Pile of Ash' though for its stark beauty and the incredible vocal performance from Stefan Zell. He 
reminds me of Geoff Tate a little bit and it's one of the reasons I initially got into the band as I'm a massive 
Queensryche fan.<p>This album is outstanding and just gets better with every listen. Check it out!</strong></strong></em></em>

I wasn't aware of their previous material initially, but ultimately being impressed took the chance
to receive a feeling concerning the already highly acclaimed 'Communication Lost' from 2011 too.
They are appointed as a prog metal act in general, hence one or two might be irritated when
listening to 'Machina Viva'. And this at least applies to the forerunner in the same way. WOLVERINE
have become solid, well-behaved, are standing on relatively smooth melodic songs, somewhat in the
vein of the later Pain Of Salvation and Opeth. <p>I mean, it is said, 20 years ago they have started as a death metal band! That noted, it doesn't
matter to me though, this new songs are just what I want to hear. Headed by Stefan Zell's remarkable
vocal presence they have developed some top-notch mid-tempo compositions for this album, really
captivating the more I'm listening. 'Take a moment now, time to make a choice' - a wonderful relaxed
start is happening with the extended suite <strong>The Bedlam Overture</strong>, though gliding over into a
heavier behaviour soon.<p>In between Thomas Jansson changes to the fretless bass, there are some guest appearances to state,
like a guitar solo from former member Per Broddesson, or just take Jonas Eklund's careful french
horn. Overall a track which deserves the label perfect. Provided with some electronic drum loops
<strong>Machina</strong> then is born to let us sing along, where the heart-breaking melancholic <strong>Pile Of
Ash</strong> will lead into a very mellow direction, solely showing new guitarist Jonas Jonsson and
Stefan Zell on the imaginary stage.<p>The impression is completely rounded, also including Marcus Losbjer's solid drum work and Per
Henriksson, who pulls out all the stops with his mostly subtle keyboard input. Additionally cellist
Stefan Moberg is in play again. WOLVERINE definitely have entered the ranks of my 2016 prog award
acts. Mixed at Spacelab Studio in Germany by the way, 'Machina Viva' is an excellent album
consisting of atmospheric songs, more tending to heavy art rock than metal, besides the already
aforementioned bands also akin to Dropshard, Ulysses, Fates Warning.

<strong>7/10 <p><em>"Communication Lost" is an emotional, pulsating album that sounds like from the near 
future, without being really innovating. </strong></em><p>Among all the Progressive Rock/Metal bands of the new decade, Wolverine are in some way 
simply one of the many, one that just stuck to the prog rules and released albums that were 
loyal to the genre, somewhat brave sounding and some innovating moments. With 
"Communication Lost", it is obvious that Wolverine have a distinct style, even though "Still", 
their previous album, sounded even more original and promising. <p>There is tons of melody and accessibility, which  definitely contributed in making this band 
famous in the prog community; as a matter of fact, the experimentation isn't really that big of 
an element on this one. What we have here are good rock songs strongly blended with 
Progressive Metal elements, such as some heavy guitars, some interesting time changes, 
nice keyboard sounds, and pretty progressive-like song structures.  Because of it's straight-
forwardness,  I can't help thinking at times of Alternative Rock as a big influence on this one. 
The moods here aren't exactly positive: some times, the music is quite depressing and sad. 
However, it is in many parts a beautiful portrait of hope. Between melancholic acoustic parts, 
dramatic keyboards, and surprising electronic bursts, "Communication Lost" is a greatly 
emotional album, definitely one of the most haunting sounding albums of 2011.  <p>Wolverine are a band that take human emotions and make them the most modern sounding 
as possible, using elements in their music that just sound of the future. However, they 
manage to do that without being particularly innovative, as the melodies are at times 
predictable, even though the songwriting is mostly very strong. But the impact this album 
gives is quite unique, and the atmosphere it has is very enjoyable. This band shows their 
talent in songwriting with songs like "Into The Great Nothing", the song that starts off the 
album after the three minute intro, or the slower but quite beautiful "Poison Ivy", or the 
strongly emotional title track and "Pulse", with it's electronic beat that makes it an automatic 
standout. <p>"Communication Lost" is a great experience for whoever loves the genre, a little highlight 
and gem for today's Prog Rock.</strong></strong></em></em>

After waiting 4 years counting days in the last month, wolverine back with a great piece 
of art and the waiting was worthwhile.<p>Lyrically, the album is well written since it has been always a strength for 
wolverine, great images with loads of emotional metaphors.<p>Musically, the band pushed the borders and mount up their innovation threshold, the ability 
to express themselves through music became more solid, unique and creative.
the dramatic full voice of the singer was always and still dominating the scene, his magical 
performance and articulation communicates the feelings on a very high level and reaches you smoothly..<p>Wolverine is a pioneer impressive act in the field of blending progressive metal music with emotions, feelings and personal message to mankind through music. <p>The album began with a dark atmosphere and a recitation of some poem with beautiful background music and ended up similarly.
The first song of the album clearly reveal wolverine imprint, catchy, melodic and energetic 
riffs....the album is ranging between heavy and mellow moments, worth to be 
mentioned a song called "pulse" with its interesting electronic beat, and "in memory" which 
contain a piano and vocal part that reminds me of the great pain of salvation Goosebumps moments <p>The last song in this album before the outro is "communication lost" which describes the 
difficult situations that we are living these days and the communication that is lost between 
individuals as well as between the individual and the true self/soul/needs.<p>overall the production is stunning especially the keys and the piano, they sounded intimate and lush...<p>Without hesitation I gave 4 stars to the album and if there was 4.5 stars it will surely be my 
evaluation mark..

3.5 stars. Man this was a disappointment the first time I heard it. I was actually shocked at how lyric 
heavy it was. Mind you once I read the words I have to hand it to them for writing such excellent 
lyrics. Still i'm a little put off with the direction they took here. For me it's always about the music first 
then the words, which is why I have such a hard time with most concept albums. Funny thing is the 
last really atmospheric album that WOLVERINE made was called "Cold Light Of Monday" and it 
was a concept album but I much prefer it to this one.Their debut is great because it is their 
heaviest, while "Still" combined that melodic style of ANATHEMA and KATATONIA to great 
effect. I've been a long time fan of these guys even going back to when the Zell brothers worked 
with the band BOOK OF HOURS which was more in the ANEKDOTEN style. So yes there is still 
lots to like here and if I could take off about 17 minutes (3 songs) it would easily be a four star 
record.This clocks in at about 70 minutes for the record.<p>
"Downfall" and the next track "Into The Great Nothing" starts things off on a very high note.Two of 
my top three tracks right there.The first is dark and atmospheric as spoken words come in. Cello 
before 2 minutes when the words stop. It blends into the next one as the drums kick in right away 
and it sounds great. Riffs then vocals follow. It kicks in heavier after 2 1/2 minutes. It settles after 5 
1/2 minutes then the vocals return. It kicks back in one more time.<p> "Poison Ivy" is okay but it's laid 
back with picked guitar, reserved vocals and cello. It does get fuller at times but..anyway it blends 
into "Your Favourite War" where it kicks in heavily right away. It settles back with vocals a beat and 
piano before a minute. I like the guitar after 3 minutes. Powerful stuff.<p> "Embrace" is too much like a 
ballad although I like the tribal-like drumming. "Pulse" is my other top three. It starts off in a reserved 
manner but it's catchy and dark.The tempo does pick up and guitar leads 4 minutes in.<p> "What 
Remains" is my least favourite. Piano, strings and reserved vocals go on for way too long. "In 
Memoery Of Me" is much better. Nice and heavy. It does settle back with vocals as the tempo 
continues to shift.<p> "In The Quiet" features vocals and a beat early on. A calm with vocals after 2 
minutes then it turns heavier. "Communication Lost" kicks in before a minute.Vocals after 2 minutes 
and some relaxed guitar after 4 1/2 minutes. "A Beginning" has these spoken words like the 
opening track then the atmosphere rolls in after they stop.<p>
Before I did this review tonight I took the time to listen to their three previous albums just to see 
how this stands up and I still feel that the others are better.That's just my taste in music of course 
as it seems many herald this as their best.</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong> 'Communication Lost' - Wolverine (8/10) </strong><p>Just when I thought all of the fresh talent in prog metal was hiding towards the more 
extreme side of the spectrum, I am introduced to this band, the Swedish quintet Wolverine. 
Although this is the band's fourth album to date, 'Communication Lost' will likely be the first 
that many hear of the band, due to the greater publicity they have received for it. Although I 
am rarely one to fall into the trap of hype, Wolverine was certainly a band I had heard great 
things about from more than a couple music experts.Although I was expecting Wolverine to 
fall into the same rut of Dream Theater or Symphony X that so many melodic prog metal 
bands do, the change of pace here is refreshing, and while not an entirely new breath of 
fresh air than what I have already heard in the style, Wolverine do plant themselves as one 
of the last vestiges of hope in a style that I personally think got tired over a decade ago.<p>My personal cynicisms for melodic prog metal aside, Wolverine are a truly impressive act, 
and the fact that I find myself so endeared to them with all things considered should be a 
testament to their strength as an act. Musically, Wolverine is not such a far cry from 
compatriots Pain of Salvation; their music is heavy at times, but always melodic, and resists 
the temptation to become an overly technical wankfest a la Dream Theater. Instead, 
Wolverine bases 'Communication Lost' around the long lost art of proper songwriting; their 
music uses sometimes complex musicianship, but it is always based in a tight 
composition, and this really grabs my attention. The vocals here are often the center of 
attention atop tasteful instrumentation, the atmosphere is kept somewhat dark and 
melancholic throughout, and- coming as a surprise to someone that was expecting a metal 
album- tastefully mellow. Wolverine is instead heavy prog rock throughout most of this, 
although I would have to say that the vocals keep a metallic tinge to the music. Stefan Zell's 
voice is generally a lower register tenor, with a stern tone to his delivery. His real highlights 
are when he goes and hits higher notes, which he does beautifully; one really wonders why 
he doesn't sing up there more, because his high register stuff is much more impressive.<p>The songwriting here is generally the highlight of the album. Everything is beautifully 
produced and polished, but the sound stays organic; a sure sign of a successful studio job. 
The songwriting really caught my attention from the first listen onwards though; while the 
atmosphere that Wolverine makes on 'Communication Lost' rarely becomes upbeat or 
cheery, they get the sadness across with a variety of different sounds. 'Pulse' is one of the 
most memorable tracks here, using some lively electronics to create a hook. 'Into The Great 
Nothing' makes perfect use of those upper pitch vocals that Stefan Zell does so well, and 
gets fairly heavy, only to be trailed by a nice acoustic passage in 'Poison Ivy'. The highlight 
moments on 'Communication Lost' are brilliant, although it would have been nice to hear 
even a couple more of them as the album progresses. The album is one of the most 
consistent records I have heard throughout the year, but it does feel like Wolverine keeps 
their sound a little too restrained; still a vast preference from the overindulgent noodling that 
the Dream Theater clones adhere themselves to, but 'Communication Lost' could have 
used a little more of the great, powerful heaviness that they only seem to hint at here. All the 
same, it gets me excited to see what else that the band has in store.<p>Wolverine are a band that I was not expecting to impress me, but they did well to leave an 
impression on me; 'Communication Lost' is an expansive collection of tracks that all 
succeed in delivering some sort of dark quality to them. Although I could still draw some 
Pain of Salvation comparisons to the band, they do have a more adventurous sound going 
for them than much prog metal, and they have been placed on the map for me after hearing 
what they have to offer from 'Communication Lost'.</strong></strong></em></em>

STRONG CANDIDATE FOR THE BEST OF THE YEAR<p>There are albums that will impress on first listen. "Communication Lost" is one of them. I had never heard of before Wolverine (animal and only Marvel character), but this brilliant album made &#8203;&#8203;me want to know the other works of this amazing band.<p>The sound here, unlike that most prog-metal bands play, is not a mere clone of Dream Theater. It's derived from Riverside, in relation to the use of electronic effects and dense atmosphere of the songs. Even Stefan Zell's voice resembles that of Mariusz Duda.<p>If you are looking for weight and aggressive riffs, this album is not for you. But if you enjoy a melodic progressive metal, heavy (for cellos emotional throughout the album) and atmospheric (many spacey influences in this album), will love "Communication Lost".<p>4.5 stars for sure.

<img src="static-images/5stars.gif" alt="5 stars" border="0">
Of all the genres in the heavy metal spectrum, progressive metal seems to be the most 
thoroughly criticized for being unoriginal and derivative; a bit ironic when one considers the 
meaning of the word "progressive". But it's hard to disagree - the amount of Dream Theater 
clones out there is staggering and, quite frankly, disappointing. That's why it's encouraging 
to see bands like Wolverine constantly pushing the envelope of what the genre can offer 
and creating fantastic art in the process. <em>Communication Lost</em> is their fourth full-
length album, and also their first in the last five years. These Swedish masterminds have 
returned with a bang, though, and <em>Communication Lost</em> is one of the finest prog 
metal releases that 2011 (or any year) has to offer. I have no problem with calling this album 
an absolute masterpiece and a mandatory purchase for all prog metal fans looking for 
something different from your standard Dream Theater-clone release.<p>Wolverine plays a style of atmospheric progressive metal with influences from acts like Pain 
of Salvation, Porcupine Tree, Fates Warning, and Pink Floyd. <em>Communication Lost</em> 
certainly isn't the heaviest prog metal album you'll ever hear, and a good portion of it is pure 
atmospheric prog rock. Every track here is extremely melancholic and dark, from a musical 
and lyrical perspective. The lyrics, dealing with heavy topics like addiction and abuse, help 
add to the overall somber feeling present throughout the entire album. The music, as 
previously mentioned, is generally soft and not too technical. Acoustic guitars, mellow synth 
tones, powerful vocals, piano, and a strong rhythm section dominate much of 
<em>Communication Lost</em>. There are also a fair amount of cello sections - a bit surprising 
for a prog metal album, but is remarkably beautiful during the piano-led sections 
(particularly on "What Remains"). Every song here is absolutely beautiful, particularly 
"Embrace", "What Remains", and "In The Quiet Of Dawn". There are a few heavier (but still 
absolutely beautiful) tracks like "Communication Lost", "Your Favorite War", and "In Memory 
of Me". This album flows wonderfully and I'd actually consider every song to be a 
masterpiece. <em>Communication Lost</em> is one of the very few 70-minute albums without a 
second of filler; that really shows what fantastic songwriters Wolverine are.<p>Although Wolverine are not as technically-oriented as the majority of prog metal bands out 
there, they still certainly have some fantastic chops and (most importantly) are capable of 
injecting soulful emotion into every note on the album. The keyboard playing from Per 
Hendriksson  especially stands out for me; his atmospheric synth playing and terrific piano 
mastery are an integral part of the music on <em>Communication Lost</em>. Stefan Zell's 
vocals also stand out to me, seeing that he has the power of Ray Alder and the beauty and 
diversity of Daniel Gildenlöw. It's hard to think of a better prog metal vocalist than that! The 
production is also spectacular on <em>Communication Lost</em>. It's clear, powerful, 
professional, and sets the perfect atmospheric feel to fit Wolverine's music.<p>I'm absolutely ecstatic about <em>Communication Lost</em>, and I sincerely hope that these 
feelings were shining throughout my review. This album is a tremendous statement from 
Wolverine; one that hopefully gets them the recognition that they deserve among the prog 
metal community. Seldom do I come across an album this beautiful, touching, and well-
crafted. Wolverine really have outdone themselves this time, and created one of the most 
recommendable progressive metal albums ever released. 5 stars are well-deserved for 
this essential masterpiece. I can guarantee that <em>Communication Lost</em> will be in my 
top five albums of 2011 - it really is that good. Even with new Opeth and Dream Theater 
albums on the horizon, I have a feeling that <em>Communication Lost</em> may remain 
unsurpassed as the year's best prog metal album. Essential!</strong></strong></em></em>

A Wolverine with dentures.<p>Yes, despite a promising name and art cover, this Wolverine has plastic teeth and rubber 
claws. A bit of a let down I suppose, but these bands can improve with time. I'll give'em 
another chance.<p>The album starts with the magnificent A House of Plagues, a super-song charged with power 
(excellent keyboards and riffs) and emotions, it kicks off very well. Alas, the album never 
reaches that level again. It falls into a softer and blander music, even departing from the 
progressing metal genre. Although I have to give them praise for the song Nothing More, 
reminding me the peaceful atmosphere of Camel's Snow Goose! I know! It surprised me too!!<p>Some bands give everything in one album, sometimes in one single song. Wolverine lack 
energy in many songs and the songs are dull by moments. Just common stuff, done 
robotically and predictable patterns. <p>If their new album is not improving, I'll be quitting this boat thinking this band needs more 
edge.</strong></strong></em></em>
