A hugely successful album on its release, "How Dare You" spawned two monster 
hits "I'm Mandy Fly Me" and "Art for Art's Sake". I remember I hardly had this off the 
turntable at the time. Each song is a gem, there is no filler on this brilliant album.<p>The first track on Side 1, the title track "How Dare You" is an excellent instrumental 
which was used in Jack Rosenthal's successful television play "Barmitzvah Boy", based 
around a thirteen year old Jewish boy's experiences during his coming of age 
ceremony. "Lazy Ways" is a lush song about "hazy ways and lazy ways" , some 
interesting arrangements here, and of course some studio and backing vocal chorus 
effects similar to  "I'm Not in Love". The next song "I Wanna 
Rule the World" is almost a crazy megolamaniac's anthem! "Wannabeaboss wannabea 
Big Boss", or just could be about an ordinary teenage kid ready to take on the world, 
though there are dark messages within, including a Despot style rallying speech, and a 
nightmare teeny tot!  "How you gonna do it - little by little, bit by bit ". The next 
track  "I'm Mandy Fly Me", a huge hit in 1976, is based on a certain Airline's advertising 
campaign slogan "I'm........Fly Me...."  featuring pretty air hostesses. In the story the 
narrator sees Mandy in the poster come to his aid during an air crash either real or in a 
dream sequence, and it seems Mandy doesn't exist at all...or does she??   "Iceberg" is 
a typical example of 10cc's quirky songwriting skills, ever feel you were being stalked by 
a maniac?? Puzzling song here ending in pig grunts (?).<p>Side 2 on the LP kicks of with the excellent song "Art for Art's Sake", which includes 
those dreamy backing vocals and leads into a stomping riff and echo effects, "gimme 
the readies, gimme the cash", a satire on art of course, and money talks.  "Art for art's 
sake, money for god's sake..!!".  "Rock'n'roll Lullaby" is a doo-wop style song similar 
to  "Donna" about getting the kid to sleep, "it's daybreak in the land of nod so get to 
sleep you little sod..." (love it), the song includes a great blues guitar solo and big 
chorus fade-out.   "Head Room" is a boogie-style/country-style rocker about a pre-
pubescent boy discovering sex with all its connotations and "drawbacks"!  
The "telephone" theme of the album artwork comes home on the last track "Don't Hang 
Up" (and "How Dare You" to a degree) which is about events we all experience in a 
lousy relationship of a broken marriage, "lots to learn about women", they're not 
kiddin' !! The song features  very watery piano effects  and ends 
with ....don't ...hang..u.....drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.<p>Some may say this could be one of 10cc's proggiest albums and i can understand that, 
in many instances while listening  I am reminded of other music that was around at the 
time such as ELO and Supertramp in style, definitely Prog-related IMHO, also an 
excellent album which stands the test of time very well indeed and I would happily rate 
it a masterpiece of rock five stars, but on PA Prog ratings a well deserved three stars!<p><p><p><p>  </strong></strong></em></em>

Another very clever studio album by 10cc. Following hard on the heals of the highly 
successful ' Original Soundtrack ' album ' How Dare You' maintained the band's credibility in 
delivering consistently good material.The title track opens up with a bang and get's usual 
10cc messages across. They remind me of the band Caravan in a way when it comes to 
lyrics. There is also no denying their similarities to the Beatles or should we say you can 
hear the Beatles strong influence on this band particularly on ' How Dare You'. ' I want to 
rule the world' is another great track, as is ' Iceberg' and the commercial ' Art for art's 
sake'. The classic four piece lineup of Godley/Creme/Gouldman and Stewart continued even 
though even at this midpoint of the 1970's there were already rumours abounding about 
conflict within the band.Good, but not necessarily essential. The diehard 10cc fan will 
already have this but not a bad place to start discovering the band if their music is new to 
you.</strong></strong></em></em>

3.5 stars really!!!<p>After the monumental Original soundtrack, everybody waited for 10 CC around the bend, 
but they not only answered present, but managed to pull another superb effort in this ugly 
art-sleeved record. The quartet of songwriters definitely managed to even better their art 
and not just for art's sake, but for commercial success. Their typical Englishness remains 
for much of this album as they are often close music-hall or cabaret music.<p>With a very symphonic title track as an opener (an impressive intro and a bit too present 
strings section), the mood is set for Lazy Ways which is much Queen-like (Seaside Rendez-
Vous etc..) and the very funny pastiche Rule The World with its huge Frank Zappa 
influences. The rest of that side of the album is regular 10 CC, Mandy being slightly too 
calm. With the dazzling Art For Art's Sake, the group reaches yet another climax and for 
the progheads maybe THE climax. And even if my comments above are a wink at this song, 
believe me that the song is justifyingly titled. Two more typical tracks and then the album 
closes on the delicate, reflective, anguished Don't Hang Up, which ends as you might 
expect it.. with a tonality.<p>As you might just not consider 10 CC never being prog, should the proghead one day want 
to investigate the group, he might want to start with either this one or its two 
predecessors. With this kind of album though, 10 CC were giving Queen a run for their 
worth. But just after this successfully approached bend, there would be another where 
half of the quartet would leave? Having never been that much a fan, I never knew the 
reasons for this split at the top of their game.

It has been a long, long time since I heard this album, but for Xmas I just got off a 
friend the remastered cd, so now I have refreshed my memory enough to give a 
review.
When it was released, this was my least favourite 10cc album. There were some 
moments of brilliance, but also moments of inconsistency, I felt.
Now, on hearing it again, I think the brilliance has won out, and I love the whole album!
The opening title track is an instrumental and is an excellent way to start. Superb guitar 
and gizmo work, and the track has a feeling of spaciousness to it that is hard to 
describe. For some reason, it calls to my mind an airport lounge!
'Lazy Ways' was always one of my favourite tracks. A superb, mid paced song with nice 
vocals from Eric and strong acoustic and electric guitar work.
'I Wanna Rule The World' was one of those tracks I could never get into, but now I 
appreciate it more. Typical 10cc this: Lots of different voices, plenty of humour and 
interesting moments of melody. Has to be heard a few times to be really appreciated 
though.
'I'm Mandy, Fly Me' was a hit at the time, and is a great song. More great tempo 
changes, some nice slow bits, great acoustic guitar in the middle - what more could you 
ask for? And on top of it all we have Eric's wonderful vocals. it tells a great story too, 
but I won't spoil that for you. As usual, great  harmonies pervade the whole piece.
'Iceberg' was another of those tracks I wasn't keen on originally, but now I enjoy it a 
lot more. This one is sung by Graham and a good job he does too. The track sounds 
disjointed, but actually gels together well. The song has an almost jazzy feel to it but 
never loses its sense of structure or melody, nice guitar from Eric here too.
'Art For Art's Sake' was another hit in the charts. Vocals are supplied by Lol this time 
and the usual biting satire is here in full force. Eric supplies a nice guitar solo at the end 
too.
'Rock 'N' Roll Lullaby' was another of my favourites, and still is. The tempo does indeed 
bring to mind a lullaby, the melody is catchy, and Kevin sings this one superbly. Another 
classic 10cc line here: 'It's daybreak in the land of nod, so get to sleep you little sod.' 
Wonderful stuff! And the harmonies here are amongst the best on the album, with the 
ending being particularly effective. A great track.
'Head Room' is also very good. The guitar work here has an almost countryish feel to it, 
but that doesn't detract from the interesting lyrics and laid back verse and chorus.
Finally comes the mini epic 'Don't Hang Up' with a strong performance from Kevin on 
vocals. This is a slower song, and has the most wonderful melody. The middle bit has an 
almost spanish feel to it, with what sounds like castanets being played in the 
instrumental section. More great harmonies lead back to the original melody. Another 
great line here: 'When the barman said whatcha drinking, I said marriage on the rocks.' 
Sheer brilliance! The very ending, as Kevin sings 'don't say...' and gets cut off, leaving 
the dial tone to fade slowly away, is extremely effective. 
On this remaster there is a bonus track called 'You've Got To Get It While You Can' 
which I think was the b - side of 'Art For Art's Sake. (Which I own.)
There is a line sung in this that the band use again on the Bloody Tourists album, on the 
track 'The Anonymous Alchoholic'. Namely: 'Everybody's having fun, so why be the one 
whose out in the cold.' 
The track is pleasant if none essential and brings a great album to a satisfactory close.
Another four star effort.</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>I'm Mandy (a freckled, spotty, specky, four-eyed, weedy little creep)</strong><p>10CC's talent for crafting appealing melodic pop songs developed through three 
appealing but often patchy albums to cumulate in this instantly enjoyable selection of 
pop classics.<p>Opening with the decidedly uncharacteristic title track, a guitar based instrumental, we 
have to await the superb "lazy ways" before we can indulge in the wonderful harmonies 
and killer melodies of the band. "I'm Mandy fly me", a huge hit single for the band, is 
one of the all time classic pop songs. A beautifully mysterious love song is woven 
around a one of the most memorable melodies, the icing on the cake being the haunting 
guitar riff and the frantic acoustic guitar middle section. <p>There are still the occasional over indulgences, such as the <I>too clever for their own 
good</I> "I wanna rule the world" and "Iceberg". In both cases, the patchwork vocal 
arrangements render the songs over indulgent and jarring.  <p>Side two of the album is slightly the weaker. The hit single "Art for art sake" is the sort 
of sing-a-long pop rock which 10CC could produce at will; it is guaranteed to raise a 
smile, even a tapping foot, but demands little effort on the part of the listener. The 
closing "Don't hang up" is a more orthodox but nonetheless captivating ballad. In 
between, we have the album's two least distinguished tracks. "Rock'n'roll lullaby" is 
a "Donna" like swaying retro piece, while "Head room" is based around the sort of 
activity which <I>results</I> in 10CC.<p>At this stage, we have to be clear here. Crème, Godley, Gouldman and Stewart are 
highly gifted pop song writers in the same way that Bjorne and Benny are. The clever 
song arrangements may at times appear to disguise this, but the music here is 
sophisticated pop, pure and simple. That is not in any way intended as a criticism, this is 
an incredibly enjoyable album. It is difficult though, to find any relationship with prog 
whatsoever.<p>The appealing sleeve design borrows from several of the tracks, including the 
lovely "Mandy" apparently receiving an abusive phone call. <p>Then, suddenly it was all over. Godley and Crème left to play with their gizmo, releasing 
the radically different "Consequences" before reverting to the 10CC style. Stewart and 
Gouldman retained the 10CC name, but the magic evaporated.

10cc may not be prog in the strict sense, but it was definitely well-done, innovative and original pop back in the seventies. And their 
best efforts have stood the test of time extremely well. This far How Dare You is the only album I've got (heard also some 
compilations), and presumably it was the best choice. There are no fillers here, and each track is crafted with perfectionism. No 
wonder that Godley & Creme have been respected producers too.<p>
The opener is a bit noisy instrumental and my least favourite track. 'Lazy Ways' is just lovely, dreamy pop song with excellent vocals 
and bass playing. 'I Wanna Rule the World' is an amazing thing to hear for the first time. The protagonist is a young, overlooked boy 
who dreams of being a dictator of the world. 'I'm Mandy, Fly Me' is a hit, and a marvelous one. Also that song and just about every 
one on this album is 'progressive' in the way of sharp changes between song parts. That breathtaking, playful, ehm, fullness of the 
songs may get a bit tiring, and therefor I don't listen to this LP very often. But the 'art' of this pop makes me amazed when I do. The 
B side is not quite as great IMHO, but ends with a beautiful 'Don't Hang Up.' 3,5 stars.
<p>PS: This is my 200th review, and 10cc is the 100th artist on my review list.

I want to review something completely different now. And what could I do better than an album that isn't really prog but indeed 
prog related. In fact it's the only prog related album 10CC has made in my opinion, although I must admit I don't know all their 
albums. But 10CC is actually only slightly progressive and this comes quite a nice way in that respect so I'll give my opnion about this 
one. <p>I believe there are only 3 prog related tracks on the album among which my favourite 10CC track of all time, I'm Mandy fly me. This 
is one of the best "pop" songs I know in history ! A tremendous track with a great instrumental passage, I'll love it forever.
The other two more or less prog related's are Art for arts sake (nice rhythm) and Don't hang up (emotional lyrics).
Other significant tracks are I wanna rule the world and Iceberg and even the rest is not bad at all. Even for a progger.
I already had the vinyl in my possession in the seventies so I think I'm entitled to give my review on this one. And it's funny that in 30 
years my opinion about the album has hardly changed. So that means it's an evergreen (or something).<p>I really like this one and anyone who wants to make a sidestep to something like pop music for a change (no more than a sidestep, 
please !) this one is very recommended !</strong></strong></em></em>

Very difficult task to follow-up such albums as "Sheet Music" and "The Original Soundtrack". The recipe is almost the same here, 
but less surprising.<p>"Lazy Ways" (Crème/Stewart) is of course fully in-line with their best work. Beatles-esque vocal arrangements and a wonderful 
melody. One of many of that kind in the 10CC repertoire. Their song-writing is excellent as usual.<p>We'll get some short opera-like songs as well. "I Wanna Rule The World" (Godley, Creme, Gouldman) features so many 
characters immortalized by so many different voices. The childish type of vocals at the end of the song seems to indicate a 
pleasant and light passage; but the lyrics (as usual as well) are totally devastating : "Everyone's going to be free. But they'll 
have to agree to be free. They'll have to agree to be less free than me, 'cos I rule the world you see". I guess that this is what 
we call dictatorship.<p>The next song is not as dark. "I'm Mandy Fly Me" (Stuart, Creme, Gouldman) is another VERY melodic tune. Fantastic vocals 
again. The spirit is again very much similar to the Fab Four. A highlight.<p>Not all numbers are unforgettable like the instrumental opening number "How Dare You" and the jazzy/pastiche "Iceberg". 
Sounds pretty much as a grotesque farce. The different themes are countless here. To be able to change so often from mood in 
such a short song is one of their great skills. But at times, it is just too much (like in this song). Not easy to recreate "One Night In 
Paris".<p>This complex texture is also found on their hit-single "Art For Art's Sake" (Gouldman and Stewart). The inventiveness deployed 
here is fabulous. Great percussion work in an apparent and straight-forward song. Still, to be able to chart with such a song 
indicates the high profile of these great composers.<p>The parodic style of the fifties is again irresistible during "Rock'n'Roll Lullaby" (Gouldman and Stewart again). The band is truly 
impossible to categorize. Each song holds so many ideas, discoveries. One should try and count how many different sub-songs 
(some sort of songs within a song) they have written. We should be surprised with the numbers.<p>This ability is not only the prerogative of the Godley and Creme duo; they were responsible of three songs on this album. The 
title track and the last two "Head Room" and "Don't Hang Up". The latter being another of their mini-opera with countless ideas 
per minute. Brilliant.<p>This album does not hold so many well-known numbers as its predecessors, but nonetheless, the band released a good and 
pleasant album. It is also amazing to see how they switched from instruments according the song. The only one to be confined in 
the percussion and related instruments being Kevin Godley. The other trio juggling with bass, guitar, piano, organ, moog etc.
The four of them being great vocalists.<p>This is why 10CC is a band with such an exceptional and unique sound. Three stars for "How Dare You".

This album means many things for 10cc as a musical entity with a history relevant for the development of British rock: it's the 
swansong for the classic quartet line-up, it's the top opus for the delivery of their elaborated pop-rock offering, it's the album in 
charge of keeping up with the momentum initiated with their previous two studio albums, it remains one of their most powerful works 
in terms of rock sonorities and cohesion among their own varied style. Although the chasm open between the two writing pairs (Creme-Godley, Stewart-Gouldman) was evident for the development of the repertoire, the performances, arrangements and sound production surely made it their best group effort. Personally speaking, it's my favorite 10cc album ever. It is 
only adequate that their cleverest repertoire had to be packaged in their best album cover. But let's go and take a look at the 
repertoire itself. The opening namesake instrumental is a funny yet somewhat intriguing journey into exotic Mid-Western and Latin 
ambiences (at certain moments I can tell what seem to be little quotations of Geroge Harrison's 'Within You, Without You'), mixed 
with alternated psychedelic and funky adornments provided by the guitar solos and clavinet phrases. It's like a musical journey that 
never seems to develop completely, not even as a jam, but the reason for that is that it's functional as a prelude to 'Lazy Ways', and 
it works very well so. 'Lazy Ways' bears a very Wings-esque feel, but it also includes a number of slight mood variations, mostly on 
eerie multi-tracked acoustic guitars that emulate the mind's transition into sleep. Both melody and sound production help the track to 
portray the laziness referred to in the lyrics. Also highly Wings-esque, albeit with an enhanced elaboration of contrasting moods, 
is 'I'm Mandy, Fly Me', one true 10cc classic (besdies a hit single). The middle section includes an agile section of strummed acoustic 
guitars and zithers, plus some fabulous (albeit too short) guitar leads. Here we find again the topic of being lost in our dreams and 
fantasies, this time in a more poralized fashion. Caught in the middle is the extravagant 'I Wanna Rule the World', a manifesto of 
future revenge from a bullied, nerdish schoolboy who swears one day will be a Hitlerian dictator. The dominant Zappaesque elements 
bring a special heat for the song's general R'n'B structure. Cabaret jazz music? 10cc never forgot about it, as it is shown in their 
bizarre tale of a serial rapist-murderer called 'Iceberg'. The candid vocal harmonies emphasize the band's sarcastic ideology, while 
the creepy intro and closure clearly portray what kind of danger is being faced by the protagonist's next victim. The album's second 
half kick off with the album's second hit single, 'Art for Art's Sake', a sort of BTO-meets-Beatles song with some psychedelic and 
funky tricks served in as resources for variation. Pleasant and catchy as it is, and with an amazing closing guitar solo by Stewart, all 
in all, it does not match the panache of 'Lazy Ways' or 'Mandy'. The following two tracks are the most simplistic ones. 'Rock'n'Roll 
Lullaby' is a stylish, clean blues-rock that ironizes about the show business stars' conceited selfs; 'Head Room' is a bluegrass-meets-
country song dedicated to sexual initiation. The B-side's master song is the album's closure 'Don't Hang Up', a deconstructive ballad 
of broken love and unaccepted reconciliation. The drunkard's pathetic claims and memories and the estranged lady's stubborn 
refusals are graphically portrayed with a clever succession of sad corny melodies, Cabaret chorale, a loud Flamenco-fusion interlude 
and romantic movie's ambiences, all the way through toward the abrupt phone call's end. This song signifies a very interesting way 
to close the best chapter of 10cc's history. Although this is a non-prog album by a non-prog band, I label it as an excellent addition 
to the collection of the proghead with a sensibility for clever, multi-layered pop-rock. "Clever multilayered pop-rock": this describes 
the very essence of 10cc at their best.       </strong></strong></em></em>

'Soft rock'? No, the first time I heard this album I was surprised that the (instrumental) opening number and 
the ditto middle section of 'I'm Mandy Fly Me' were pure, unadulterated symphonic prog. Those two tracks formed part of an astonishing A-side, which features a sequence of songs that follow each other just as naturally 
as, say, the material on the A-sides of SGT. PEPPER or A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.<p>Some reviewers have compared 10cc's songwriters with Bjorn and Benny from Abba, but I beg to differ: 
10cc's best efforts (of which HOW DARE YOU's A-side is one) are far more varied than Abba's singalong 
tunes; they overflow with jokes and sudden mood changes. The standard comparison with Queen isn't 
particularly apt, either. Queen's massive choruses remind me of classical opera and oratorio; 10cc's 
choruses (and their four-part harmonies) are more closely related to the music you'll hear in pre-1960s 
Hollywood musicals. (For this reason, I guess, 10cc are also close in spirit to the vocal tracks on Zappa 
albums like ROXY AND ELSEWHERE or SHEIK YERBOUTI.) Moreover, when members of Queen (particularly 
Freddie Mercury) sing solo, their vocals are usually camp and fraught with sexual innuendo. 10cc's solo 
vocals are more polite and restrained - like old style English 'music hall'. There's an essential difference 
between Freddie singing 'Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon', and 10cc intoning the far more timid (yes, IN 
SPITE OF its naughty lyrics) 'Headroom'...<p>So, let me sum up: HOW DARE YOU's original A-side is a highly inspired sequence of music which I advise you to get hold of if you enjoy civilised, theatrical tune-smithery. The B-side is a different matter. Its middle tracks sound rather insipid and annoying. Its opener, 'Art for art's sake', isn't too bad, but after 
a couple of spins you'll tire of it. The final track, 'Don't hang up', is as brilliant as the first half of the 
album. (The CD bonus track, by the way, is totally forgettable.) When all is said and done, what does 
HOW DARE YOU have to offer? About 25 minutes of top-drawer music. Many so-called 'great' albums provide
far less.</strong></strong></em></em>

How Dare You is the fourth album from 10CC. After The Original Soundtrack which proved to be a 
commercial breakthrough, because of the single I´m not in Love, 10CC were eager to follow up the 
succes and How Dare You proves to be a worthy follow up to The Original Soundtrack. In fact I think How 
Dare You is a better and much more entertaining album than The Original Soundtrack.<p>The album starts with the instrumental title track which is actually very enjoyable. It´s not because it´s 
complex or challenging, but more because of the melodic qualities and the superb production. Other great 
tracks would be I Wanna Rule the World, I'm Mandy, Fly Me, Iceberg and Art for Art's Sake. The latter 
with an actual hard rock riff. I´ll make sure not to forget the intricate and beautifully crafted Don't Hang 
Up. The feature I enjoy the most about 10CC´s music is there vocals though. Beautiful mulitlayered 
vocals and intricate vocal lines means that every song is quite the experience even though the basic 
formula is vers chorus. Commercial music like this couldn´t have survived on a prog site without intricate 
instrumentation though and there are lots of exciting instrumental parts. They don´t stand alone most of 
the time though but are generally played while the vocals dominate. One thing I shouldn´t forget when 
reviewing this album is the great humour that 10CC is known for. These lyrics are very cleverly written 
and sometimes reminds me of the biting sarcasm of Frank Zappa.<p>The musicianship is outstanding. Everything flows easily even though 10CC play some pretty challenging 
things underneath the commercial exteriour of the songs.<p>The production is otherworldly. 10CC simply had some of the best productions of the seventies.<p>How Dare You is a very good album and it actually reminds me a bit about my favorite 10CC album Sheet 
Music. At least it sounds closer to that one than to The Original Soundtrack IMO. I think How Dare You is 
an above average album and I´ll rate it 4 small stars. Recommendable to people into commercial music 
with a twist.</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>Art for art's sake?</strong><p>How Dare You! opens with an instrumental which tells you something about the album, namely that the level of instrumental skill is slightly higher here compared to earlier albums and that there are more guitar solos and other instrumental passages allowed. The songs are not as completely vocal driven as on earlier albums.<p>The sarcasm, sillyness and the humour is still very much here, but the lyrics are still slightly better and more sophisticated than on previous albums. The arrangements are a bit better as well. The production value is high, and the sound is good. <p>There is also much less of the annoying boogie-woogie, rock 'n' roll that plagued previous albums (Rubber Bullets anyone?).<p>From a Prog perspective there is little, if anything, to enjoy here. <p>This is possibly 10cc's best album, and a good place to start if you want to explore this band. Still, like all 10cc albums, this is for fans and collectors only. Needless to say, 10cc is not a band I like very much.

Melodic, multi-textured well balanced soft - rock / art-pop. Almost as all 10 CC albums of their 
earlier period, you have here the music you expected.<p>If you dont like mid-tempo melodic songs with strong pop touch, better even don't start with 10 
CC at all. But from another hand, how many groups of that time had so perfectly balanced and 
precisely played and recorded music?<p>I always get esthetical pleasure listening this album. Clever humor, sangvinic songs, perfec 
musicianship. Yes, it's far from prog-rock in ortodox sense, but it's very near to very good 
music of it's time.<p>I can compare that music with Roxy Music, but Roxys always had strong theatric decadance 
smell both together with some psychodelic spices in it. There you hear oposite thing - 
clever ,always cynic, but well balanced sound ( even enthusiastic, if that combination is 
possible with cynism).<p>Recomens to all lovers of bright melodic music in art clothes. One of good 10 CC albums.</strong></strong></em></em>

In my opinion, this is one of the finest crossover prog album ever recorded.  Unfortunately, it was the 
last 10CC album to feature the full original band.  Lol Creme and Kevin Godley left after this one, to 
maket their "Gizmo" invention and record the weird and wonderful "Consequences".<p>The album begins with the instrumental <I>How Dare You</I>, a cool rhythmic piece, with some of the 
best guitaring on any 10CC album.  <I>Lazy Days</I> takes it down just a bit, with a nice pop tune.  
Then there's <I>I Wanna Rule The World</I>, a bizarre but exciting little piece, with some theatrical 
vocals that would put "The Wall" to shame.  <p><I>I'm Mandy, Fly Me</I> begins with a snippet from <I>Clockwork Creep</I> hinting a bit at the plot.  
The song is one of those where the guys juxtapose dark lyrics over some very light music, a technique 
they've used since their early albums (think <I>Rubber Bullets</I>).  <I>Iceberg</I>, the jazziest song 
from the band, begins with the singer lamenting his girlfriend's lack of emotional response to him, and 
brilliantly unfolds into his madness.<p><I>Art For Arts Sake</I> sounds like it could be a companion piece to <I>The Wall Street Shuffle</I>, 
another tale of greed.  And <I>Rock 'N' Roll Lullaby</I>, a fifties styled ballad, attempts to scare 
children to sleep ("The sandman's gonna get you!)<p><I>Head Room</I> is a one joke song with sexual innuendo.  And <I>Don't Hang Up</I> is alamost a 
companion piece to <I>Iceberg</I>. It's a symphonic styled song, with some clever lyrics, with again 
the protagonist at first sounding just lovelorn, until we discover he's a stalker ("It's me that's been 
diggin' your shadow.  It's me that's been shadowing your dog.")<p>It's too bad the band went downhill after this.<p>4.5 stars - rounded up.</strong></strong></em></em>

One of the coolest things about reviewing albums is listening to full length recordings of bands I knew about(when I 
was young) from the hits on the radio, but that's all I knew about them. 10CC might be the biggest surprise for me as 
far as not sounding anything like I thought they would based on what I had heard. Those vocal arrangements, vocal 
tones and expressions really brought ZAPPA and QUEEN to mind. And the humour, in the ZAPPA mode. Not my thing  
but it was hard not to be impressed with this band despite feeling that both "Sheet Music" and "The Original 
Soundtrack" were pretty hit and miss. <p> "How Dare You!" is next in line as I just have these three records from the 
band. I did not expect this to be a step up from those two but I feel it is. Look at the endless things each musician 
plays, and then hear the vocals and lyrics, well the songs really, which I feel are much more consistent than the 
previous two records were. Godley and Creme would both leave after this album to form, well, GODLEY & CREME. I 
don't know but I feel this is the one 10CC record where those two were just hitting their stride, most of what they were 
coming up with worked, even for the adventerous Prog fan like myself.<p>The entertainment value here is high and 
the lyrics remind me of what maybe Zappa , Fagen and Becker(STEELY DAN) would have come up with if they were in a 
band together. Hmmm... ZAPPA, STEELY DAN and 10CC on a triple bill back in the day? Get in line for that one. "Lazy 
Ways" seems like such a simple little pop tune but check out those lyrics which seem silly, but how is this so uplifting 
to me? Repetitive but it works. "I Wanna Rule The World" is hilarious and ZAPPA sounding with the vocals and 
arrangements. There's even a short disco section. Yikes! "I'm Mandy Fly With Me" actually brought Canterbury to mind 
simply for the whimsical vocals and easy sounding music. There's zither on this one. <p>"Iceberg" is catchy like most 
of the tracks are but with QUEEN-like vocals and harmonies. "Art For Arty Sake" is the one track that stands out for 
me. Fuzz bass too! But yes some aggressive instrumental work on this one but man how can you not like this one? 
That ZAPPA quota is high here. "Head Room" works for me with the beats and bass with vocals and guitar over top. So 
catchy. "Don't Hang Up" ends it and it's the longest at almost 6 1/2 minutes. Too funny at times, I'm laughing out loud. 
Nice bass and QUEEN comes to mind on the chorus.<p> A pleasant surprise and I'm happy to own this one. I want to 
say this ends my 10CC adventure, and it does, but I have one GODLEY & CREME record I've been spinning on and off 
for weeks to get to for me to close the book on these guys.</strong></strong></em></em>

Other reviewers say this is not prog. Well, it is not. In 1975 we returned to the US from vacation and they were 
playing "I'm Not In Love" nonstop. One of the greatest songs of all time. Maybe it was that, but *something* 
prompted me to buy this album almost 50 years later. Not only is it not pr

This is one of the most loved 10CC albums, full of catchy, witty songs. There are some 
beautifully lush moments as well, such as the smooth 'Lazy Ways'."Don't Hang Up" is 
particularly moving too as is the better known "I'm Mandy, Fly Me", with its rather crafty lyrics.

This is 10cc's best and most prog-related album in my view, and the one that should be 
most enjoyable for people on this site. If you don't mind your progginess coming in 4 to 
5 minute chunks with clever, cynical lyrics then this should definitely hit the spot. 
Highlights include the jazz-rock
