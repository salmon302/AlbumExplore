Come chill out and relax to...death metal??!<p>Strange as it sounds, there's no question.  CYNIC's <em>Focus</em> deserves every bit 
of the "hype" it's getting here on ProgArchives.  Before adding my own rating the 
average is 4.88, and I'm about to send it up just a touch higher.  Especially if you like 
OPETH or VOIVOD, this is an absolute must-have; your collection of prog-metal is 
incomplete without it.  Even if you are not as much into prog-metal, I think it's worth a 
try if you're willing to be adventurous and get yourself used to the death vocals that 
appear through some of the songs.  This album has only a few small weaknesses--the 
sound quality is not what a bigger band would have, and I wish some of the songs were 
longer.  The death vocals aren't that bad, either, but can take a little bit of getting 
used to at first...but they are complemented very nicely by computerized vocals (yes, 
you read that right), and some other singing.<p>Lyrically...I think this album would prove attractive to many who are put off by the 
darker content of some metal.  They center around Eastern spirituality, and even if this 
is not your faith, it makes for some pleasant reading and meditation as you listen to 
<em>Focus</em>.  But the real focus on this album is the musicianship, which is 
<strong>outstanding</strong>.  My favorite among the musicians is bassist SEAN MALONE, 
whose style reminds me quite a bit of JOHAN DE FARFALLA, formerly of OPETH.  DE 
FARFALLA played on <em>Orchid</em> and </em>Morningrise</em>--and I actually found 
myself thinking of <em>Morningrise</em> quite frequently while listening to <em>Focus</em> 
in other aspects besides the bass work.  If you liked <em>Morningrise</em>-era OPETH, 
then you are really missing out by not listening to this.  Metalheads will also enjoy the 
incredible speed demonstration in "Uroboric Forms" by drummer SEAN REINERT.<p>The music itself reminds me of what VOIVOD only wishes it could be--at times dissonant 
but still managing to be melodic and flowing...sometimes brutally heavy, but always 
gorgeous.  The opening track, "Veil of Maya" does a good job of setting the tone for 
the entire album and demonstrating this style--but don't make the mistake of thinking all 
of the songs follow the exact same formula.  And even though they're short for the 
most part, you'll feel as if you've been listening much longer...and I mean that in the 
best way possible.   "I'm But a Wave to..." is a fantastic demonstration of CYNIC's 
ability to walk the line between dissonance and melody without ever managing to cross 
too far as VOIVOD did on <em>Nothingface</em>, and for this it's one of my very favorite 
songs on the album.  There's a very "spacey", atmospheric, almost psychedelic feel to 
many of the softer sections, such as the outro to "The Eagle Nature" and the beginning 
of "Sentiment", which seems a bit creepy at first until you realize that the words being 
spoken are really a very <strong>positive</strong> sort of sentiment.  Another standout 
is "Textures", which actually manages to incorporate a fusion/jazz feel, complete with 
Rhodes keyboard synth!<p>If you are at all into prog-metal, you <strong>must</strong> find a way to track down a copy of 
this.  OPETH fans especially...don't miss out; believe the hype!</strong></strong></em></em>

A poor album that ought never to have been released in its current form.<p>Chief among the many sins committed by this group is the dreadful vocals. Though heavily processed, 
they still manage to sound thin. If the effect desired was to mask any lyrical merit, the album's producer 
has succeeded. The growls are risible, childlike in their execution and meaningless in the context of the 
music. A couple of songs begin promisingly (How Could I, for example), only for the mood to be 
shattered by the vocodered vocals. CYNIC, how could you?<p>The music itself is competently, sometimes outstandingly played, but spoiled by the production. The 
producer manages to make every instrument recessive. Compared to a well-engineered album like 
OPETH'S Blackwater Park, this is virtually unlistenable. One for the coaster collection. What a pity.

This rather brutal progressive metal music has something very primitive: the extremely 
guttural lead vocals will make you think the singer is a Neanderthal; at the same time, 
there are omnipresent robotic voices that give a slight futuristic touch to the music. 
The rhythmic guitar and the overall sound are rather gross, so do not expect a crystal 
clear razor sound coming from the omnipresent riffs. The melody is pretty hard to 
decode in most of the tracks. The drums are fast and elaborated, and the presence of 
fretless bass is appreciable mostly during the more mellow bits. It seems the tracks are 
more interesting when the rhythmic guitar riffs stop, leaving the room to miscellaneous 
distortion-free guitar notes, which clearly remind progressive bands Gordian Knot and 
King Crimson. Even the brutal rhythmic electric guitar has similitudes with the ones on 
the Gordian Knot's tracks, except the music is faster here. There are some good 
modern keyboards, but they are very rare. The unmelodic & inelegant throaty lead 
vocals lower the global rating of this record. One must keep in mind that these guys as 
VERY talented, as reveals "Textures", a rather jazzy instrumental track a la King 
Crimson of the 80's: the fretless bassist has really the Jeff Berlin's style, and the 
guitarists have nothing to envy from Adrian Belew & Robert Fripp! <p>Rating: 3.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>

- THE Death Metal album for all people, who don't like Death Metal!? <p>How logical sounds this? At least THE album, which broke the boundaries of that extreme genre and created something unique, which will remain as the pinnacle of what is in technical and creative 
aspects possible.<p>Cynic, a legendary band that fused their love for Death Metal with a recent influence of 
Jazz/Fusion and progressive rock. The result is here, Focus is an album that was 
beyond it's own time, the instruments are all played perfectly and, thanks to a crystal 
clear production they can be all heard clearly. <p>Paul Masvidal and Jason Gobel give a 2 guitar lead assault to your ears, most of the 
moments each one is doing a different riff, and the occasional use of guitar synths are in 
the right place, extending the texture of the riffs or of the song itself. Paul and Jason 
work with other bands (most notably Death and Monstrosity, respectivelly), helped to 
give them experience in the Death metal field while hearing Chick Corea and Allan 
Holdsworth pavimented their way to the freedom and dynamics of Jazz/Fusion. Paul's 
robot voice just sets the mood through deep meaning and philosophical lyrics, giving 
the songs a more cosmic feel. <p>Sean Reinert plays here in a very jazzy style, in a few moments you can hear him 
repeating the brutality of his performance in Death's "Human" (most notably in Uroboric 
Forms), but most of the time his playing is filled with jazz technics and complex rhytms, 
which makes him one of the best drummers in the world. <p>Sean Malone is a bass god and shows here all his talent and creativity, sometimes using 
the unusual Chapman Stick, just hear his bass solo in the brilliant 
instrumental "Textures" to see what I'm talking about, and since his bass is high in the 
mix there will be no problems to experience his contribution here. <p>This is indeed the thinking man's album, filled with jazz influences and familiar death 
metal. Influences are clear, but they manage to create something completely original 
and unique. As an extra note, "How Could I?" is, in my opinion one of the very best 
songs written by a Prog/Death Metal band and is spectacular every time I listen to it. 
The outro solo is the perfect cap to this trip through "Focus".<p>This album is a classic and to be played at maximum volume. The robotic-vocals surely 
may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they are an important part of the fact why this 
album seems so unique and futuristic. Trust me, there's something to be found for any 
prog fan on this album!<p>
album rating: 9.5/10 points = 93 % on MPV scale = 5/5 stars<p>
point-system: 0 - 3 points = 1 star / 3.5 - 5.5 points = 2 stars / 6 - 7 points = 3 stars /

3 1/3 Stars<p>A very unusual, creative, and groundbreaking debut that unfortunately is the only 
album by Cynic. I am sure that the band would have gotten much better than this, such 
as Opeth after the interesting, yet flawed Orchid.<p>I discovered this band by the sample here. It was from the early 90s and this song 
featured fretless guitar playing remnicent of Jaco Pastorius, great rhythms with 
unusual time signatures, funny caveman-like grunts, electronic singing, and gorgeous 
female vocal harmonues. I was completely hooked! I had to get this album.<p>Sadly, the rest of the album doesn't come close to the absolute metal masterpiece of 
Veil of Maya. The next songs don't sound as natural when mixing the genres and the 
extreme vocals (caveman growls and electronic voices) turn me off a bit. Also, melodies 
seem to be nowhere. However, there is a lot to enjoy. Celestial Voyage has great 
guitar riffing. The Eagle Nature is mellower and less brutal. Sentiment has great 
drumming and an unique menacing female? vocalist. I'm But a Wave to alternates 
beautiful sections with brutal ones in the style of Opeth. Textures is just bizarre jazz-
metal with great bass playing. How Could I is one of the best constructed songs in this 
album and a great closer. Sadly, I just find Uroboric Forms as a bunch of shredding 
under unusual rhythms and I do not like it.<p>I expected better stuff, but it is still a terrific album. I can't think of many metal songs 
that come to the originality and quality that Veil of Maya achieved. That song is 
perfectly constructed and sounds coherent and natural (not to mention accessible 
despite the complexity of it). Everything is perfect in that track.
 
Highlights: <strong> Veil of Maya </strong>, How Could I<p>Let Downs: Uroboric Forms<p>My Grade : C+<p></strong></strong></em></em>

Jazz Metal<p>Arguably one of the most overlooked influential bands of the progressive metal
movement is Cynic and their album Focus, which was unfortunately the only album this
group would produce. The fretless bass gives an added texture to the often "spacey
futuristic" sounding themes in a majority of the tracks, credit to the distorted
vocals and tone of most of the softer jazz passages. <p>There is no track in particular to me that stands out. All follow along similar
guidelines giving the songs a connection and wholeness to the majority of the album.
Most of this has a very technical sound to it as well I have found (although never
seemingly going overboard into solo wankery context) similar perhaps to the complex
riffs of Watchtower, but with more of a death metal space/jazz vibe. Urobic Forms is
perhaps the most "metal" of all the tracks, with many staples of the genre in its
structure. <p>If I were to consider something for those who are in disfavor of metal, Textures
comes to mind, with it's interesting and complex arrangement (although their are
still some parts with a heavily distorted guitar). As a side note, this record is
also fairly valuable, as it is difficult to find, though maybe not quite as *kvlt* as
it's often considered. Not particularly moving or emotional music, but it is an
extremely complex and interesting way of approaching the "death-metal" movement. </strong></strong></em></em>

From the late 80's early 90's burgeoning Floridian technical death metal scene comes this 
one album band...  But this is no mere metal album.  Focus was, and remains to this day, 
one of the most groundbreaking metal albums ever made.  Not only were they the first to 
blend metal with jazz (complete with fretless bass and all), but to add a new age and fusion 
flavor to an already improbable mix and actually make it work  ?  Who else managed that ?<p>From the first seconds of the album, you know you are facing something unique.  Metal 
punches on jazz chords with keyboards (or synth guitars), electronic AND acoustic drums, 
and a robotic voice...  That voice annoyed many, but not me, I found it to be fitting and 
original.  After a drum driven intro, the band dives head first in metal territory with 'Veil Of 
Maya'... but wait, do I hear a jazz break ?  From death brutality to jazz subtlety, without 
distorted guitars, but beautifully interwoven clean guitar parts, fretless bass and jazz drum 
motifs, and back to metal again ?<p>That's what we are treated with here (treat is the right word) throughout the album.  The 
musicianship on this album has yet to be surpassed by ANYONE in prog metal territory 
(Dream Who?).  The riffs are monstrous, the interplay between the two guitars (either 
clean or distorted) unmatched and highly creative, the drums are mind-boggling and 
diverse, from electronic to acoustic drums, from full on double bass drums beats 
masterfully executed and tight as... well you think of something tight (!!!), to wonderfully 
light jazz patterns, the jazzy fretless bass parts (handled by bassist extraordinaire Sean 
Malone, who would later play with Gordian Knot and on O.S.I.'s excellent debut album) 
incorporated in death metal music was unheard of and TRULY original, and even if it's been 
done by others since then, it was never even close to what Malone pulled off on this album.<p>I don't know if it's because Cynic only released one album that they became a cult classic, 
but let there be no doubt in your mind about the quality of this album.  Rarely have I taken 
such a trip listening to metal (apart from Opeth, of course), and rarely have I been so 
amazed with each and every song on one release.  <p>A five star album, timeless, classic, 100% original and flawlessly executed.  A shame they 
never released anything else, but in a sense I understand, how in the world could they 
have topped Focus ?<p><p> </strong></strong></em></em>

Here&#8217;s another review in a genre I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time with.  My idea of good metal 
dates to the first few Iron Maiden albums, Black Sabbath, and maybe a little bit of 
Rainbow.  This is definitely not in that.  Early Opeth maybe, before that band 
discovered black roses and long, romantic walks in the catacombs.<p>I never did get the whole growling thing, although in the case of Cynic you can make 
out some of the words, and the guy actually appears to be making those sounds with 
his real voice, which is kind of cool.<p>This is another one of my kid&#8217;s albums, but one that I actually seem to listen to more 
than him.  The reason is the very first track &#8211; &#8220;Veil of Maya&#8221;.  That vocal phrase just 
gets burned into your skull the first time you play this, and pops up uncontrollably at the 
most awkward times, much like an old seventies acid flashback.  At eighty miles an hour 
on the highway usually, so it&#8217;s a good thing I live in a sparsely populated state where 
the cattle and deer can dodge oncoming traffic quite well.  If you don&#8217;t like the way I 
drive, stay out of the pasture I always say.<p>Other great things about this album?  The drums for sure &#8211; a blistering rapid-fire beat 
that doesn&#8217;t seem to let up the whole thirty-plus minutes of the album.  This guy must 
have steel rods in his shoulders.   And a comparatively normal lead vocalist singing over 
the top of Screechy Guy is a nice touch, gives the songs a bit of a creepy, rainstorm at 
an old Bavarian castle feel to them.  <p>Most of the songs sound pretty much alike though, but I think that&#8217;s sort of by design 
with these scream-metal bands.  &#8220;Uroboric Forms&#8221; is a nod to prog I guess, since the 
band manages to do a little tempo changeup coming out of a drum n&#8217; shred onslaught, 
and that quickly morphs into another onslaught just as quickly as the first one 
disappeared.  The drummer has some serious ADD issues I think, &#8216;cause he&#8217;s about to 
ratchet his arms right off from the tempo up-tick at the end of this.<p>The other unique tune is &#8220;Textures&#8221;, which manages to run the gamut of jazz/fusion to 
metal to an ambient instrumental kind of thing and finally a string-plucking fadeout 
ending.  Really, I can think of quite a few eighties electronica bands that could have 
sounded like this if they&#8217;d just added a speed-addled drummer and maybe one more 
guitar.<p>My biggest complaint is that this is awfully short for a debut album (which turned out to 
be a swansong album at the same time).  &#8220;Veil of Maya&#8221; has a really solid rhythm going 
that should have been drawn out with some guitar progressions and maybe a drum solo 
(what the hell), and &#8220;I'm But a Wave to...&#8221; seemed to end too abruptly even though it&#8217;s 
the longest track on the album.  Other than that this is a great blood-pumping album of 
throaty metal with just enough instrumental variety in some places to keep it 
interesting, as opposed to giving you a long-term headache like a lot of death metal 
does.  This is for sure a four-star album, and recommended to everyone except maybe 
emo-types and symphonic fans who are worried about blowing their speakers.<p>peace</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>What do you expect from progressive metal album?</strong><p><strong>Power and Energy.</strong> This might be one of some factors that you
consider important in progressive metal music because from this factor you can get
full enjoyment of the music. This would help you start the day with great motivation
and if you have work to day it energizes you. I put this as first possible factor
because from my discussion with many prog met and metalheads, that is the first thing
thoat mostly comoe out from their mouth as an answer of the above question. If this
applies to you as well, this album by CYNIC fulfills your need. All tracks presented
here by CYNIC are truly songs with solid power and energy. No wonder, this band, as
you might read at the band's description at this site, was intended as brutal death
metal (what is this?) music. So, no question about it - if you expect power and
energy, you got it. You can hear guitar riffs and licks by Jason Gobel and Paul
Masvidal. They play attractive and stunning guitar work throughout the span of the
whole album. On rhythm section, you can get great combination of bass by Sean Malone
and drums by Sean Reinert.  "Celestial Voyage" is a good representation of track with
power and energy as indicated by dynamic drumming, guitar riffing and tight basslines
which accompany "throaty" (I like this description!) vocal by Tony Teegarden. <p><strong>Melody and Harmony.</strong> You can get these as well. Overall, this album
has excellent harmony combining main rhythm section (guitar, bass & drums) with vocal
line and guitar solo. What makes this band different from many other prog met bands
is the way bass guitar is played which reminds me to the jazz rock fusion player :
Jaco Pastorius (os Wheather Report). Looking at the fretless bass he uses, it's clear
that the way he plays is something like jazz rock fusion style. The melody of almost
all songs are also nice even though not as nice as Kamelot, Nightwish or Royal Hunt.
Combined together all components that make up this album are excellent example of how
the combination creates good harmony and melody. <p><strong>How this album is different?</strong><p>There is more this album offers to us: it has a significant element of jazz rock
fusion music. This can be heard from the textures of each song where the fretless
bass provides fusion like music during some breaks and in fact in some major segments
of the song. This is truly different if we compare with any typical prog met bands.
If my memory works well, this reminds me to a band called AGHORA (released in 1999)
which I reviewed the album sometime ago (long time ago) at this site. "Focus" by
CYNIC came out first (1994) - so it could be CYNIC is the pioneer for this type of music.<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><p>This is an excellent album. If you don't like heavy riffs of metal music, you would
not be able to identify the subtleties of music this band offers. The music is a bit
rough with some eerie / throaty vocal line. If you cannot accept this kind of singing
style, you may not be able to enjoy this album. <strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p>

Jazz Fusion Death Metal.<p>CYNIC is one of a handful of revolutionary bands that have ever managed to successfully merge jazz fusion and extreme metal
and this is perhaps one of the purest amalgams of these genres with a psychedelic twist to boot. Focus is an album of
differing extremes, the music is very well layered and structured with clean guitars interspersed with distorted metallic
guitars, in perfect relevant contrast, vocodered robotic vocals and choruses to counter the death growls (the vocoder vocals
are generally a point of contention and take a long time took me a long time to get used to) and technical double kick driven
beats contrasted by groovy jazz beats.<p>The opening song 'Veil of Maya' is easily the best on the album invoking dark reverent atmospheres with it's opposing double
kick driven verse and dreamy chorus, the use of complex jazz chords is the key to the complex emotive components of the song
- these guys really know how to write a song. Instrumental song 'Textures' is another fantastic song with some dreamy jazz
fusion noodling periodically broken up by heavily distorted and harmonised guitars and the mystical middle breakdown section
is to die for with an amazing bass solo. The album ends on a strong point with the the triumphant 'How could I' with my
favourite guitar solo on the album. Another superb song that is only featured on the 2004 reissue is the song 'Cosmos'
(written under the PORTAL band name - a post CYNIC project by some of the members) with dreamy phased guitars washing around
in a textured psychedelic blanket.<p>The instrumentation on this album is fantastic, all the musicians are of the highest calibre. The guitars are fairly
technical and have many nuances and the solos are quite fast but at the same time extremely musical, The bass is very fat and
there are a few great sections and the odd solo and the drums are the best of the lot, very technical and well considered (It
is worth noting that lead guitarist Paul Masvidal and drummer Sean Reinert played on Death's highly technical and
neck-breaking death metal release 'Human' just prior to recording Focus giving you an indication of their technical proficiency).<p>Focus is one of the most creative and interesting extreme metal records ever recorded and is essential to anyone serious
about progressive metal, fans of ATHEIST and PESTILENCE would definitely enjoy.</strong></strong></em></em>

<em>"Focus"</em> is the debut full-length studio album by US, Florida based progressive metal act <B>Cynic</B>. The album was released through <B>Roadrunner Records</B> in September 1993. <B>Cynic</B> had been around since 1987 though, and had been an integral part of the early Florida death metal scene, releasing no less than four demo cassette tapes in the years 1988-1991. It took a while to find the right label and get signed, and the release of <em>"Focus"</em> was further delayed by the session work/touring that the members of the band did for/with other acts in the early 90s. Original bassist <B>Tony Choy</B> (who was replaced by <B>Sean Malone</B> for the recording of <em>"Focus"</em>) recorded with both <B>Pestilence</B> and <B>Atheist</B> (and eventually joined and toured with the latter), guitarist <B>Jason Gobel</B> recorded the <em>"Imperial Doom (1992)"</em> album with <B>Monstrosity</B>, and drummer <B>Sean Reinert</B> and lead vocalist/guitarist <B>Paul Masvidal</B> recorded the <em>"Human (1991)"</em> album with <B>Death</B> and subsequently toured with <B>Death</B> in support of the album. <B>Masvidal</B> also recorded guitars for the <em>"On the Seventh Day God Created... Master (1991)"</em> album by <B>Master</B>. So they were definitely a busy bunch in those years.<p>So <B>Cynic</B> were known as a death metal act and therefore the sound on <em>"Focus"</em> came as a bit of a surprise to the contemporary death metal community. Stylistically the album features occasional death metal heaviness and aggressive snarling vocals (courtesy of session vocalist <B>Tony Teegarden</B> from <B>Epitaph</B> as <B>Masvidal</B> had serious issues with his voice and couldn´t record the extreme type vocals for the album), but there is a major jazz/fusion influence in both the choice of notes/chords, the guitar solos, and the on the drumming style. Add to that <B>Masvidal´s</B> robotic vocoder delivered "clean" vocals and spiritual/philosophical lyrics and a generally ambient ethereal atmosphere to the music, and <em>"Focus"</em> is anything but a regular early 90s US death metal release. The fact that they were often refered to as a death metal act, when a label like technical/progressive metal would probably have been more appropriate, and they ended up touring in support of <B>Cannibal Corpse</B> and receiving quite a hostile reaction from many audiences at the time, were probably contributing factors when they decided to call it quits already in 1994. They did reach an audience who praised the bold originality of the album, but <em>"Focus"</em> has become more retrospectively recognized than it ever was upon release. Not completely unlike the story of <em>"Spheres (1993)"</em> by <B>Pestilence</B>. The contemporary metal scene apparently weren´t ready for that revolution yet.<p><em>"Focus"</em> is an exceptionally strong and original sounding release though. The alien sounding vocoder vocals are probably an aquired taste, but they create an almost futuristic sounding counterweight to the raw snarling vocals, and provide the album with a very distinct vocal sound. Guitar synthesizers are also used (so what sounds like keyboards on the album are actually guitars played through synth effects) and further enhances the feeling that you are listening to something completely alien. The two guitarists play different guitar lines, chords, leads/rhythms constantly, and are complimented by the fretless bass playing, and the ever changing time signatures and rhythms. It´s multi harmony and rhythmically very complex music.<p><em>"Focus"</em> was recorded at Morrisound Recording in Tampa, Florida with producer <B>Scott Burns</B>, and while he successfully captures the essence of heaviness, the album does feature a slightly thin sounding production job. It´s mostly the distorted guitars which could have prospered from a more meaty tone, but on the other hand, it is a sound production, where the listener is able to hear all details. Overall the sound production suits the music well. <p>The material on the 8 track, 36:13 minutes long album are well written, quite catchy and melodic for music as complex as this generally is. It´s a varied and dynamic album too, where each track stand out as something special and outstanding. Tracks like <em>"Veil of Maya"</em>, <em>"I'm but a Wave to..."</em>, and <em>"How Could I"</em> are all tracks featuring both atmospheric acoustic moments and more aggressive heavy moments (the latter also features one of the most beautiful guitar solos (the closing solo) I´ve ever heard), while tracks like <em>"Sentiment"</em> and <em>"Textures"</em> stand out for other reasons. <em>"Sentiment"</em> is an atmospheric track with spiritual lyrics and <em>"Textures"</em> is an instrumental jazz/fusion track (with some metal elements).<p>Upon conclusion <em>"Focus"</em> is a unique release. It was unique in 1993 and it´s unique today. Sure there had been other artists like <B>Watchtower</B>, <B>Sieges Even</B>, and <B>Atheist</B>, who before <B>Cynic</B> did, had incorporated jazz/fusion elements to their brand of metal, but <B>Cynic</B> still managed to create their own sound with a focus on atmosphere/spiritual ambience. It´s not only a unique release it´s also an outstanding one and a 5 star (100%) rating is deserved.<p>(Originally posted on Metal Music Archives)</strong></strong></em></em>

Cynic - Focus, this album for many is a masterpiece, to me only a good but non essential.
I might say that the album is  progressive, heavy and melodic at the same time, that is no doubt, but is repeting in many places same 
all riffs, same voice, i can't say that the voice is from The Eagle Nature or another one for ex. Is true that the musicians are gifted, 
and skilfull and they are among the best in genre, that's way they were invited as a guest or permanent musicians in many bands 
and projects, but that not save the album to be almost boring in places. A 3 star album for me, not bad , but less enjoyble then 
many other albums from metal scene.<p>

CYNIC had surely the potential to be an amazing band. They released only one album which has been 
heralded as a masterpiece for a long time. I think the album is good, it's important in the history of 
metal, but it's not as great as many people think. <p>For sure, the musicians are terrific, and we get constant displays of prowess throughout the album. Of 
special importantce in my view is the rhythmic section: Reinert and Malone really push the boundaries 
of extreme music with techniques that weren't so popular in metal music at the time when Focus was 
released. We can hear lots of amazing playing out of these two guys who are the backbone and the 
most interesting part of this album. <p>The guitar playing is skillful, in a way innovative, but the sound of the whole album (even in its 
remaster) it's not clear enough to let me appreciate the 6-string work. I hear a lot of riffs (that remind 
me of DEATH; this was their biggest fountain of inspiration I guess) played at increible speeds but not 
much in the way of melodies. Well, this is extreme metal after all, melody is not the main point of this 
genre (but there are plenty of extreme albums out there that don't forget to include good tunes). There 
are some interesting textures, but again, it's all a little bit noisy.<p>I have two big problems with this album (and mostly with all extreme/tech metal): the vocals and 
the songs. Some extreme/tech bands have great vocalists but weak songs, some have better songs 
and awful vocalists. This one has a little bit of the bad side of both. <p>The vocals are plain annoying. There's two kinds: some growling (high-pitched, which I usually tolerate 
less than deep growling a la OPETH) and some electronically-produced voice which sounds kind 
of cool at the beginning, but wears out quickly as it's the blandest voice ever heard. It has no tone, 
no key, no nothing. It's like a true computer voice, with no soul. I'm not saying that's not an interesting 
idea, to devoid the music of any soul; but when the rest of the music is also so tune-less, the whole 
experience gets difficult to swallow. <p>Another problem I have is the song structure. Other than Veil of Maya (which really stands out miles 
above the rest of the package) I can't seem to recall any other one, try as I might. They're chaotic, 
and the noise doesn't help to tell any structure apart. Veil of Maya it's a masterpiece of extreme 
metal, but we can't survive this whole recording with just one song. <p>An influential album, an essential album in any extreme/tech metal fan's collection, but not  
masterpiece of music. I give it 3 stars as there's not enough music for me. <p>A second album by this group would've been a masterpiece, somehow I'm sure of that... Sadly, we'll 
never know. </strong></strong></em></em>

Cynic - 'Focus'
4.8 stars<p>A landmark release which contemporary jazz metal acts build on.<p>This album, in my opinion, is one of the most influential albums in history.  This really put technical metal 
with jazz leanings on the map.  To complete the demo group that roamed about for a few years, bass 
virtuoso Sean Malone replaces lesser bass virtuoso Tony Choy and Tony Teegarden takes over on vocals 
and adds keyboards to the band.  The only member that isn't essential to the line-up would have to be 
Tony Teegarden.  Paul Masvidal still does vocals, but makes a bold change.  His backing vocals, are sung 
and not growled like his fellow band mate Teegarden, but they are computerized.  This style caused a lot 
of controversy, but I think it is quite good.  They remind me of a voice box, but a bit more subtle and 
digitalized.  It was a unique thing; I think that warrants them even more credit.<p>The jazz and metal elements are weighted pretty evenly, with just a little extra on the metal side.  There 
is no trash in the metal though; it is nice and technical with some shifting time signatures, obscure chords 
and scales.  The guitars are combined perfectly in dealing with leads, rhythm and counterpoint.  The solo's 
are just out of this world, some of the most technical on record but they just sound so restrained.  Even 
when watching videos of the band live they make it look like it is nothing big.  Sean Malone gives a huge 
bass performance, a style which seems like he playing rhythm, but it just sounds like a solo or lead take.  
Sean Reinert is once again giving his phenomenal drum work another shot.<p>Chaotic and subtle, this release is near perfect.  Sometimes the riffs can get a tad boring, but all the solos 
are entertaining.  I would recommend this to nearly anyone, who cares if it has death metal vocals.

I feel like the band sent me a message with this album: Cynic, focus! So for this review I will be completely serious and will not digress with strange puns or anecdotes.<p>I've never been one to own, enjoy or recommend albums based on their importance in the development of music. I understand why Jimi Hendrix is arguably the most important guitarist of all time, but his compositional or playing skills have been far out done since his depature from the world, so I see no need to listen to him. I see music as a constantly evolving mass, where artists continue to discover new territory and/or build on the foundations laid out by those who have come before. Sure, some bands from the past reached a level of brilliance that gave their work lasting power even to this day, but to say that no one has been able to do better (or at least achieve similar heights in their own way) is absurd. <p>Cynic is one of those bands who created a brand new sound but was never able to perfect it. Focus, the group's only release, is a strange blend of death metal, jazz and computerized vocals. The group sports a clear technical prowess, backed by the Sean's Malone and Reinert, who play in ways that no one could have fathomed in metal. Surely it must have been difficult to make such an album as this and even harder to make a masterpiece out of it. When the first track plays, one might be pleasantly surprised at how well it all comes together. "Veil of Maya" is a fantastic song, and worthy of repeated listens up to this day. It's unfortunate, though, that the rest of the album doesn't live up to the groups potential as the first song did. The songs tend to sound empty, probably having a lot to do with the vocals. Death vocals for the sake of having them usually don't work very well. And obviously an electronic voice isn't going to sound natural, and it won't be able to convey emotion very well. Today's technology would have turned the idea out pretty well, but unfortunately it doesn't work out here. The songs in general also lack memorable qualities. I couldn't remember a single track other than the opener on the first listen, but sadly the rest of the material didn't leave me with much of a desire to go back for another spin. Still to this day I have trouble getting through it. It is just too empty in too many places. And the production was just awful!<p>Due to the unique nature of the album, and the fact that this is the band's only output, people tend to herald this as a masterpiece. Such is not the case. While being important in the history or progressive metal, and displaying a sound that hasn't been attempted exactly by anyone else, it is not as good as it gets. Their next album may very well have been a true masterpiece. If only, if only...<p>The members of the group have gone on to play in other projects, though. My favorite is, by at least a mile, Gordian Knot. That group features the Sean's and is more melodic and memorable. Nothing at all like Cynic, but much more worth my time. </strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>A very good album that definitely changed the way extreme progressive metal was conceived in the
90's</strong><p>Cynic's debut, entitled Focus, is to this day an important album for metal in general. Their unique
usage of synthesizers (both vocal  and normal synthesizers), keyboards and fusion twist in their
music is obviously what brought attention to them, since it is quite rare to use such things in
metal even today. However, besides the pioneering composing and usage of instruments in metal, there
is a big problem that i just can't accept in an album as important as this one, and that problem is
the vocals: although the synthesized vocals are very nice (making me remember King Crimson's 21st
Century Schizoid Man) the guttural vocals are somehow plain and shallow, something that definitely
brings their music, in general, down, since the guttural vocals attract more attention then the
synthesized vocals.<p><em>About the songs, musicianship and other features, there are some things i would like to state:</em><p>The instrumental work is, overall, very good. Both guitars make a very good and wide job: they
sometimes have two rhythm guitars, sometimes the two play more melodically (i mean, both develop
melodic lines or melodic themes instead of riff-to-riff themes) and sometimes one plays the rhythm
guitar and the other is the soloist guitar. The bass work is also very competent, as it makes a very
good base sound for the band, being the base or initial melody of the harmonic structure, supporting
the guitars and the drums. The drums too make a very nice job: instead of simply signing the tempo,
it is an instrument of its own, completing very well the whole band. The drum work reminds me a lot
the drum work of Atheist: technical, complex, brutal and independent.<p><em> Grade and Final Thoughts</em><p>Although this album is one of the most important albums of the extreme progressive metal scene, i
can't pick one song that truly stands out and the vocal problem just brings the album grade down,
besides the exceptional instrumental work. So, because of that, the grade is 4 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

A terrific album to say the least. On top of being great though, it is also a very important album
as it was one of the first to blend jazz with death metal (alongside Atheist's trilogy of albums),
and ultimately was a huge part of the progressive metal movement in general. The atmosphere is all
round very dark, but because of the jazzier, airier sections it is a lighter album than most death
metal inputs. I find the instrumentation on Focus also very similar to that of Human, which was
obviously a massive influence on Focus if you listen closely. It could also be that both the albums
have Paul Masdival and Sean Reinert featured, but you can also hear that Masdival has picked up a
few compositional tricks from the great Schuldiner, most evidently in the gut-punching Uroboric Forms.<p>But despite being heavily influenced by Human, Focus definitely stands alone in the metal timeline.
Human broke down barriers between genres, and Focus carried on where it's predecessor left off, and
in some ways broke down even more. In my opinion, Focus also did a lot for the metal world in a
sense that it opened up death metal to a wider range of audiences. From my experiences, this cult
classic is appreciated by classical fans, jazz fans and metal fans alike, whereas normally a
classicalhead or a jazzhead wouldn't even consider listening to an album of this genre. As mentioned
in an above interview, this is a death metal album for people who don't like death metal.<p>As for the songs, they are all strong with no real weak points. I do have my favourites, but I can
happily listen to the album in its entirety and get a strong buzz from it. Each one has something
different and unique to offer the listener, whether it be in the realms of jazz or metal. I will go
through each of my very favourite tracks.<p>Veil Of Maya -<p>The opener is one of the best of all 90s metal, and that is saying something as metal bands tend to
open their albums with a very powerful song. Veil Of Maya is different though, because it is one of
the heaviest songs and one of the weirdest songs Cynic have ever recorded. My favourite section has
to be the female vocal sections, as they are just plain weird but beautiful at the same time. The
guitar solo here, as with all of them off this disk, provides the jazz influence most obviously.
Great track though, recommended for any prog lover, and I'm also to believe that the mp3 is sampled
here on PA, so there is absolutely no excuse not to have a listen.<p>Celestial Voyage -<p>Simply stunning, this track currently has... 91 plays on my itunes, and i am stiull finding
something new within every time. Everything is just stunning all the way through, and Masdival's
robotic vocals sound perfect on here, just perfect. It is also highly technical in places, like the
guitar solo in 15/8 for example. Nothing more I can say about this track, other than like the one
before, strong jazz influences are popping their heads through all over the shot and that it's
pretty damn heavy. Don't be put off though, this is a phenomenal piece of art.<p>Uroboric Forms -<p>The heaviest on the album, this one is also very strange to unprepared ears. Fantastic nonetheless.
The drumming on this is also top notch, but who would expect any less from one of the underated
drumming greats of all time, Sean Reinert? A very tight composition with catchy melody here and
there, brilliant syncopation and killer riffs. As mentioned above, this bares a few similarities
with any song off the album Human by Death.<p>How Could I -<p>I don't really like to do this with a masterpiece album, but if I were to pick a favourite, this
would undoubtedly be it. Everything is here: loud sections, quiet sections, great lyrics, melody,
brutality, outstanding performances from all musicians, technicallity, syncopation... even
keyboards. If there ever was an archetypal Cynic song, then this would be it. Utterly superb.<p>Overall, I think this album deserves a lot of patience, and takes a lot of time to appreciate fully
(it took me the best part of 6 months). But once you do hit the stage of liking it, you will
probably love it. There is so much to offer here (more than most of the albums on this site for that
matter), from drum solos to irregular time patterns to jazz guitarwork and death growls, all in the
space of half an hour. For this reason and the many reasons mentioned within the songs, this album
is a masterpiece. There is only one album from the 90s that competes with this one, and that is
Death's Symbolic, which is possibly the greatest metal album of all time in my opinion. 5 stars,
without an inch of a doubt.</strong></strong></em></em>

This is a tough one for me to rate. If it was an all instrumental album i'd offer up 5 stars and it 
would sit with my favourite Metal cds, but it's not an instrumental record. As others have noted 
the growly vocals aren't really a positive and there's also processed vocals mixed in. It's so impressive otherwise though with Malone on bass and chapman stick 
and Reinert on the kit. I'm a big fan of both. And it's very cool having Gobel and Masvidal both 
playing lead guitar and synth guitar. And also there's that Jazz influence that is part of the 
equation. This is a very influencial record to say the least. <p> There are two tracks that are not affected by the growls, one 
is  "Sentiment" which is so impressive with the bass, synth guitar and laid back passages.The 
vocals are pretty much spoken words here or are processed. Check out the guitar after 2 1/2 
minutes. Great track ! The other is an instrumental called "Textures" where they contrast the 
heavy and lighter passages very well. I like the intricate guitar 1 1/2 minutes in and the 
chapman stick a minute later. Regardless of the growls this is a mind bending album folks.<p>
A strong 4 stars from yours truly.</strong></strong></em></em>

Progressive Jazz Death Metal Masterpiece<p>I entered the amazing world of Cynic's music with their recent TRACED IN AIR, which I 
consider one of the best pieces of metal ever written. I finally got around to buying their 
debut, FOCUS, to complete my experience of the band. For the rest of the metal community, 
FOCUS was one of the monumental pieces of work that sat in isolation in history as a 
singular burning star of brilliance. It is not surprising the high ratings it receives for those 
who heard it in its own time frame.<p>For those unfamiliar with the band, Cynic is the oldest collaboration between two incredibly 
musically talented high school friends, guitarist / vocalist Paul Masdival and drummer Sean 
Reinert. Their friendship extended to study of an enormous breadth of musical styles and 
philosophical ideas, much of which found its way to their musical expression. Cynic 
incorporates beautiful jazz chording with highly technical death metal and multiple vocal 
textures. On FOCUS, the primary voice is a death-style growl clearly influenced by Chuck 
Shuldiner. (Masdival and Reinert played on the legendary Death album, HUMAN, while still 
trying to promote Cynic.) Alongside the growl is a robotic-vocoder processed voice and 
occasionally an ethereal female voice. In addition, Masdival uses occasional guitar synths 
to provide yet another texture. Like Death, the music is more composed, intricate, and 
complex than simply speedy, though the players have chops to spare. Unlike Death, Cynic 
are among the most harmonically rich bands in any genre. In other words, this is an 
extreme metal with deep prog sensibility. <p>Relatively shortly before the recording of FOCUS, bassist Sean Malone was recruited to the 
mix. Bassist in death and thrash were legendarily kept in the background, but Malone not 
only holds his own in this insanely complex music but actually shines and adds another 
level to the mix. His work makes the jazz even more tonally pleasing and adds legitimacy to 
the attempt to meld apparently contrasting styles. Similarly, Reinert's drumming is 
simultaneously meticulous and musically loose, and extremely difficult line to straddle. <p>Where TRACED IN AIR features the robotic vocals in front to create a beautiful soundscape 
that essentially exists nowhere else, FOCUS is still death metal with added color. FOCUS 
is about musicianship, playing, and in that it dazzles. The songwriting is still a bit immature, 
especially in comparison to TIA. But we also get that proverbial youthful enthusiasm. The 
production is legendarily rough, and a later remaster both improves and takes away in 
large enough degrees to be a continuing source of discussion among fans.<p>I was planning to give this album a 4. But I can't. Though I don't like death metal vocals, 
though the production is rough, though TIA adds melodic sophistication in a more 
complete and mature musical statement, FOCUS still deserves to be ranked among the 
best of the best. Cynic are in a class untouched, in my opinion. I've listened to a lot of jazz-
metal searching for something to grab my heart, mind, and soul. So far, only Cynic has 
been able to do it, and they've done it twice.    </strong></strong></em></em>

Finally, a breath of fresh air from the metal scene of the '90s! The album kicks off on a right note with <em>Veil Of Maya</em> which shows everything that Cynic has to offer in a true tour de force fashion. Fortunately this greatness doesn't really stop until the final note of  <em>How Could I?</em> is played.<p>
Cynic offers us a very mature sounding debut album that shows that the band has been at it for much more than what the release date might indicate. There are a few minor compositions, like <em>Celestial Voyage</em> and <em>The Eagle Nature</em>, that might at first seem excellent but after they're settled in they loose some of their former glance. Still there are enough magnificent moments that compensate for these lesser moments making the album a must have for all the fans of the genre. My personal favorite composition is <em>Sentiment</em> which has a nice groove to it and therefore pushes the music is even further outside the standard limits of the genre.<p>
Cynic's debut basically delivers everything I enjoy about the Tech Metal so if you're interested in exploring this very versatile genre then I recommend that you start with <em>Focus</em> since it will be a real make it or break experience. The only possible flaws are the dated effects that were used to enhance the vocals, but I consider them quite charming, a sort of <em>the T-Pain effect</em> of the '90s!<p>***** star songs: Veil Of Maya (5:23) Sentiment (4:23) How Could I (5:29)<p>**** star songs: Celestial Voyage (3:40) I'm But A Wave To... (5:30) Uroboric Forms (3:32) Textures
(4:42)<p>*** star songs: The Eagle Nature (3:30)<p>Total rating: 4,20</strong></strong></em></em>

Death Metal. To those who are not fans, (and probably some that are) we think of unrelenting,
grinding guitars, cookie monster-esque growling, blasts beats and blazing solos. To those less exposed
musical minds, death metal is an ungodly mess of music, and it certainly could not compatible with
much else. <p><p>As I was getting into the world of progressive music I thought the same. However, Death Metal can
indeed be taken into unique directions. Death's later work pushed death metal into a technical
direction, Opeth took it in a progressive direction, while Atheist merged it with jazz. Jazz & Death
Metal? Yes, and it's great. However, the band Cynic took the Jazzy Death Metal idea and ran into a
completely unknown realm. This album is one of the most unique works of metal created. A true blend
of Jazz influence and Death Metal. Unlike most prog/tech metal bands which have abrupt section
changes this album is fairly smooth flowing, even in its transitions between death metal and jazz.
The drumming of Sean Reinert is brilliant and very jazz influenced. The guitar work of Paul Masvidal
and Jason Gobel is creative, intricate and just amazing. Adding to the jazzy feel is Sean Malone on
fretless bass, (one of the few times you'll hear a fretless bass in Metal!) and it has that distinct
warm, "thumpy" feel, unique to a fretless bass. We then have Tony Teegarden handling keyboards and
death growls. This is contrasted with Masvidal and his "robotic" vocals, via vocoder. <p><p>The music on this album is truly great. Despite its heavy jazz influence it is indeed rooted in
death metal, and you can hear it in the riffing, double bass drumming, and of course death growls.
However, for a metal head it may take some getting used to, (it did for me at first) since these are
not the heavy, crushing riffs we're used to. Also, speaking of getting used, Masvidal's robotic
vocals are the only real knock on this album. It took A LOT of getting used to for me, as it is not
only different but flat out strange. Eventually I did, and it really is a great contrast to the
death growls and gives the album a unique feel. <p><p>There is no weak song on this album. Every one is a winner. I do not want to give away any details
so I will just say that Veil of Maya, How Could I, and the surprising Textures, are the standout
tracks. The songs are not too long, so they do not boring and really don't have any down parts. The
musicianship is superb and while every instrument is great, and works together well, as a drummer I
am struck most by Sean Reinert's drumming. Truly spectacular stuff. <p><p>Not for all prog fans, but I think this album is more accessible then most prog-metal. If you can
tolerate guitar and of course death grows, (or at least look past them and listen to just the music)
then you will like this album. It is not perfect however, as I mentioned I do not really like the
robotic vocals all the time, and sometimes it is difficult. For me personally, they made this album
very difficult for a while and with such a major point I was thinking four stars. However, I did
warm up to them, and maybe some will take to it quickly. Not to mention this amazing music. A must
for any prog-metal fan and those regular proggers who are more tolerable. <p><p>Five Stars</strong></strong></em></em>

|B| A staple in the history of the jazz-fusion death metal scene.<p>An excellent addition to any prog collection indeed! The album Focus is the debut of the well-known
band from the jazz-fusion/death metal scene called Cynic. It was forged in the early-mid nineties,
when this sort of metal was most popular in the metal scene, hence the uprising of bands like
Atheist, Pestilence, and Death. There is a great variation of sound on the work: metal with styles
of speed, death growls, and technicality, and progressive jazz-fusion with clean chorused-guitar,
asymmetric meter, clean vocals with effects, and complex composition.<p>The musicianship here is staggering. There is a studio split of two guitars, and the bass is
fret-less (!) and you have alternating usage of the death vocals and clean vocals, which is very
charming. Many of the electric guitar riffs have the double picked riffs (where the rhythm is
sixteenth notes while the melodic riff is eighths), very characteristic even in the band, including
in their follow up album Traced in Air. The composition is often head spinning, usually either
sounding like a fast version of Death or a sort of prog-rock sounding Chick Corea, and everything in
between. This is an album that definitely takes multiple listens to understand very well, to say the
least. This music would be incredibly fun to play for the few who would be skilled enough to play it
decently.<p>To compare to the recently released follow up Traced in Air, this album is definitely on the heavier
side (the band became much more tame on their follow up), more technical and less melodic. However,
the riffs and composition overall is superior and more interesting in the opinion of this reviewer.
While Tranced in Air probably has a few tracks that certainly are up to par, the overall album is
less consistent in quality. The only even slightly mediocre tracks on Focus are "Eagle Nature"and
"I'm But a Wave To..." and the rest are superb, my favorite being Textures, a very fun and
complicated heavy jazz-fusion piece.<p>This is an album every fan of progressive metal ought to hear, and is essential to the fan of the
jazz-fusion/death metal era from the nineties.</strong></strong></em></em>

<B>How Could I?</B><p>Cynic's <em>Focus</em> is often considered to be one of the best prog/technical death metal albums
from 1993 - which is surely no small achievement when one considers the competition. <em>Individual
Thought Patterns</em> by Death, <em>Elements</em> by Atheist, and <em>Spheres</em> by Pestilence are just
a few classics from that year. So why is <em>Focus</em> among these classic albums? For one, this is a
groundbreaking album in extreme metal; surely among the most important in progressive death metal.
Second, the music has all the ingredients for a masterpiece. Technical riffs, a complex rhythm
section, and heavy yet beautiful melodies should create the perfect extreme prog metal album, and in
a way it does. But the music itself is rarely interesting for me. There are a few bits here and
there that I absolutely adore, but most of the music here just doesn't grab me. It's as if this
album has all the right ingredients to make the perfect cake, but the chef left it in the oven for
far too long. Yes, he did the most important part correctly, but the end result is still less than
what it should be.<p>Despite the fact that I find <em>Focus</em> to be slightly overrated, it still is one mighty fine, and
unique, album. The music here is not something you find too often in other acts. The best label I
can give <em>Focus</em> is technical progressive jazz death/thrash. You could say that Cynic is
similar to Atheist, and in many ways they are, but Cynic has a much different sound than Atheist
even though they can both fit the same genre label. There are some weird "roboto" vocals on
<em>Focus</em>, the production is spacey, and the music is generally softer than Atheist. Still, if
you like Atheist, Cynic should be right up your alley. However, be warned - I love Atheist, but
Cynic has never appealed to me as much.<p><em>Focus</em> is an 8-track, 36:13 album. Of the 8 tracks, there are only a few truly great songs.
They would be the opening <em>Veil of Maya</em>, the haunting <em>I'm But A Wave To...</em> and the
instrumental <em>Textures</em>. Most of the other songs are good, but not very memorable or just
compositionally flawed. In almost every song, however, there are a few moments of genius. If Cynic
were generally better songwriters, this album could've been much better.<p>The musicianship on <em>Focus</em> is, obviously, fantastic. If you know anything about these
musicians, you'd know that they're all fantastic. Their playing is tight and precise, and work
together as a unit perfectly. My only complaint with Cynic in terms of musicianship is the vocals,
which I find to be sub-par. Tony Teegarden's throaty growls are very annoying IMO, and I really wish
Cynic would have someone else take over the harsh vocals. I can't say I'm a fan of the roboto vocals
either. If Cynic would've found an adequate growler, and a solid clean vocalist (rather than the
roboto stuff), I would probably be much more impressed.<p>The production is a bit of a problem. Although the spacey atmosphere is definitely appropriate, it
could have been executed much better. The sound is very rough, and actually destroys most of my
listening experience. The drums sound especially weak on <em>Focus</em>.<p><B>Conclusion:</B><p><em>Focus</em> is an unquestionably classic album by Cynic. If you're interested in extreme
progressive metal, I have no hesitation in calling <em>Focus</em> essential. The technical riffs,
unique style, and relevance in the Florida technical death metal scene make this album worth a
purchase, but the music itself tends to disappoint me. Thus, the highest rating I can give is 3
stars. Despite my lack of interest, this is an album every progressive death metal fan should hear
at some point.</strong></strong></em></em>

I just purchased both Traced in Air and Focus. While I am enjoying Traced, I can't help but notice how much more engaging and interesting Focus is. Every song, every nuance, every treatiment, every instrument comes as such a surprise?delightful surprises! There is absolute genius in creativity and innovation with regard to sound structures and use of sound technologies. This is quite possibly the finest metal album I've ever heard?one that is immediately accessible?and enjoyable--to even me, a non-metal head. 
I own the CD version that has the 2004 remixes of "Veil of Maya," (10/10) "I'm but a Wave to?" (9/10) and "How Could I" (8/10) as well as three songs that were not on the original 1994 issue, "Cosmos," (8/10) "The Circle's Gone" (9/10) and "Endless Endeavors" (10/10) and, I have to say, I like all of the additional material equally if not better than the original stuff. There's more clarity and definition to all instruments in the remixes?everything is seemingly 'brought forward' in the mix instead of left back in a cloudy atmosphere. The three additional songs show a less technical metal side to Cynic?even a kind of MAGENTA/MARTHA & THE MUFFINS-like sound in both "The Circle's Gone" and "Endless Endeavors."<p>The musicianship is so high, the band plays so tight, the compositions and individual performances are so creative?even innovative--I'm simply astounded. The weakest part for me are the vocals?even though I like the call and response technique--growl & 'vocoder'?but not used over and over like this. On songs like "Textures" (10/10?1994's version of KC's "Discipline/Indiscipline"), "Sentiment" (10/10), and "I'm But a Wave to ?" (9/10) the vocals are often almost incidental and allow the listener to better appreciate the work of the instrumentalists and the overall composition. And I actually quite like the occasional and very effective presence of a female vocalist, (Who is this?she is uncredited. It can't be Paul Masvidal, can it?) and I like the Earth doom/human spirituality/quantum physics message of the lyrics. The sudden and unexpected 'tender' sections are delightfully fun?and quite interesting from a compositional perspective. Unquestionably, the lead and 'rhythm' guitar playing, drumming, and bass (esp. the PASTORIUS-like fretless) is absolutely brilliant throughout.

<strong> 'Focus' - Cynic (7/10) </strong><p>The first half of the 1990's was a very important time for extreme metal. While the Norwegian 
black metallers were out getting infamous for church burnings and murder, the Florida 
death metal scene was really taking shape. With such now-legendary acts as Death and 
Athiest getting their foot in the door by throwing in a bit of jazz into their extreme thrash 
sound, Cynic would take its own form on the heels of these giants and create a classic in 
their own right. A guitarist with experience in Death as a backing guitarist for Chuck 
Schuldiner, Paul Masvidal was already an established musician in metal at the time his 
flagship project's debut album took form. Now considered an essential piece of work for 
progressive death metal, 'Focus' certainly shows a great band in action, but like so many 
essentials of the genre, it is something I find more appreciation in its historical context than 
the music itself.<p>Being a relative newcomer to the music of this band, I was first introduced to Cynic through 
'Traced In Air', the band's second album that was released a long 14 years after a hiatus. 
With that in mind, I cannot help but to compare this record with that one. While 'Traced In Air' 
has since become one of my favourite metal records of all time, this one feels far less 
intentioned than its successor. Regardless, the music here is as technical and complex as 
it would ever be for Cynic; blistering riffs, the drumwork of an atomic clock, and plenty of 
weird psychedelia to give the jazzier elements of this album an even darker feeling than the 
metal elements.Possibly Cynic's most distinct aspect are the vocals, in which frontman 
Paul Masvidal sings through a vocorder to give his voice a futuristic, 'robot' sound. Alongside 
him is Tony Teegarden, who apprises the growls on 'Focus'. While I was always in big 
favour of the clean vocals on 'Traced', 'Focus' shows Masvidal taking the robot sound 
perhaps a little too far, and the technicality rarely works well to incorporate the vocal 
melodies; which are rarely too well integrated. Instead, 'Focus' focuses (pun by all means 
intended) on the more death metal and weird aspects of Masvidal's genius. <p>As far as the metal goes here, 'Focus' is in top form. Unrelenting technicality of riffs, strong 
growls and fair dynamic go hand in hand. Unfortunately, what is quite clearly brilliant 
musicianship and technical composition gets marred somewhat by the relatively weak 
production. The jazzier guitar elements fare a bit better, especially on such a track as 
'Textures', which showcases Paul scaling through frenetics as if he is being chased by a 
demon. As for the psychedelia incorporated here, it's quite a mixed bag; some sounds 
(such as the opening synth on 'How Could I') are incredibly tacky and weak-sounding, while 
the soundscapes generally work to give a spiritual side to Cynic's debut that isn't seen on 
other Floridan death metal albums.<p>A very good album by all accounts, and certainly influential. It is the production here though 
that really takes its toll on the music, and while immensely indicative of the band's talent, it 
feels often more like a brilliant, yet grossly flawed work over any label of perfection.</strong></strong></em></em>

Cynic were a part of the original death metal boom in Florida in the early 1990s. This was the 
groups only album until 2008 when they finally released a follow up. I had heard of Cynic in 
the '90s but not until recently did I actually hear their music. I just assumed they had more than 
one album. They were one of the first death/extreme bands to incorporate jazz fusion into their 
music. What stands out is the vocoderized vocals used on the album. They make otherwise 
ordinary vocals sound melodic. Alternating with them is a vocal style that sounds somewhere 
between hardcore punk yelling and death metal growling. Sometimes you hear what sounds 
like female vocals as well.<p>
The first song "Veil Of Maya" you can listen to here on PA. Some nice jazzy guitar at times. 
The 'chorus' part is kind of catchy. "Celestial Voyage" has some cool sounding vocals. Great 
guitar playing and drumming. "The Eagle Nature" features some nice 'clean' guitar and some 
echoed talking. Some kind of digital synthesizer is used towards the end, very symphonic even 
for a few seconds. "Sentiment" fades in with some tribal percussion before great basswork 
takes us to the heart of the song. Female vocals going back and forth in the stereo spectrum 
as the drumming gets more interesting. The last minute is notable for having the band slowly 
faded out while a repeating sound on synth can be heard.<p>
"Uroboric Forms" has some very melodic and catchy vocoder vocals. What sounds like female 
vocals in the middle. The music changes throughout. It actually goes into straight death metal 
at the end. "Textures" starts off very Math Rock sounding...very good math rock too. Gets jazzier 
around 1 1/2 minutes. There is a twangy melodic guitar line here which gets repeated that I 
just love. Includes a solo on either fretless bass or Chapman Stick. Gets more math rock-y 
near the end. An instrumental highlight. "How Could I" begins with a sequence on digital 
synth. Eventually drums take the band into more jazzy death metal with melodic and 
memorable vocoder vocals. Some of the 'clean' guitar here almost sounds classical. Great 
bass playing during the harmonized guitar solo. What sounds like an organ at the end.<p>
The playing is terrific and the sound is decent. The songs are not very long. My only major 
complaint is that I don't like the 'throaty' vocals too much, but they are not as bad as some 
vocals in metal. The bass parts and the vocoderized vocals really stand out and put this group 
in a whole other league of extreme metal bands. Haven't heard the follow up yet but plan to. I 
will give this 4 stars.  </strong></strong></em></em>

Cynic's debut album is certainly an impressive achievement which proves that they had great 
chops both as a death metal band and as a jazz fusion band, but at the same time I don't quite 
think it's the all-time classic it's sometimes made out to be. Though the technical death metal 
sections on the album and the jazz fusion sections are great, too often that's just what they are 
- sections, with the band not quite going far enough in integrating both approaches; a lot of the 
time instead of playing both styles simultaneously in a genuine mingling of the genres, they'll 
play a death metal bit, then a fusion bit, then another death metal bit, and so on. Still, they're 
good bits.</strong></strong></em></em>

This is an album that is guaranteed to piss off the purists. It's not death metal enough. It's not
jazz enough. It's not progresesive enough. Waaa! Get over it. This album has taken me a long time to
appreciate and not to come off as some BS elitist but geez. Such complex music doesn't hit you upon
first listen or even the tenth. Yes. There exists music that takes multiple listens to fully take in
to "get." FOCUS, the debut album by CYNIC is one of those such albums. There are definitely hooks to
be had on this album but they will surely rub you the wrong way as they unfold unless you are a fan
of a multitude of genres of the musical spectrum.<p>Let's start with metal. They are indeed a metal band but only in amplification, death metal vocals
and thrash metal performance of the chords. The chords themselves are firmly placed in the
jazz-fusion branch of progressive rock. In fact dare I say that CYNIC is the Mahavishnu Orchestra of
extreme metal?  Perhaps so. Electronica. God forbid. What are these funky Floridians thinking for
frack's sake? Yes, they use a strange electronic embellishment to enhance the vocals but there is
also a sound of electronic music mingled in with the wholeness of this project. Sacrilegious?
Perhaps. Satisfying because this band knows no arbitrary boundaries? Fer sure. <p>CYNIC were simply in their own world. They took their influences and put them together in a way they
saw fit at the time. Would I have done things differently? Of course. But I am judging this album
because this band simply did things their way in a time when that wasn't very popular to do so. This
album has become much more popular over time as many a progressive rock album has since its release.
What can I say? They melodies are a brilliant mix of melody, harmony, dissonance, brutality,
tenderness, accessibility and avant-garde all jumbled together. Yes, it is easy to find faults with
this album at first listen because it doesn't measure up  to YOUR personal take on how this fusion
should have arisen but did you do anything better? If taken on its own merits from the time it was
released it is a musical masterpiece that not only takes many listens to fully comprehend but
rewards greatly once those walls of "getting it" have fully been broken down. <p>Genres are simply nomenclature that someone else created to sort things into digestible arenas but
when one realizes that music is a series of spectrums that demand careful assignment and
occasionally tagged exceptionalism then it is easier to embrace albums such as FOCUS that don't
easily fit into any. Upon first listen I liked this album. Upon quite a few I love it. This is not
only a cornerstone in metal music but a brilliant piece of art that works on so many levels once a
full comprehension of influences has fully been embraced. I hope you don't let your initial
impressions impede you from letting this album grow on you. It is one of those rare pieces of music
that can take your breath away after countless listens. Absolutely brilliant.</strong></strong></em></em>

Focus is a highly complex, challenging, and cryptic metal album from early in the prog-metal period. It is frequently 
described as "death metal meets jazz" by other reviewers, but I think this is an over simplification because it probably 
won't sell a fan of either of those two genres of music alone on the group's sound. Focus isn't heavy, oppressive, or 
loud enough to be conventional death metal, and it isn't so open-ended or mellow enough to be avant garde jazz. So 
what the heck is Focus?<p>Well, it's definitely more metal than anything else. There is a prevalence of chugging, guitar shredding, and growling 
vocals to lock it firmly into that genre; however, it's very tame compared to "real" metal bands like Slayer or Metallica or 
(insert "real" metal band here). Focus is noisy and moderately aggressive, but it's not going to destroy you with metal 
awesomeness. Maybe that's where the jazz comes in? The band strives, and succeeds, to make their flavor of metal 
highly instrumental and complex. There are countless time/key/dynamic changes within songs, and each of the players 
is on top of their game. The drumming is one feature that I think distinguishes Focus from other metal bands, Reinert's 
playing is clear and often the "jazziest" of the bunch; very different sounding for a metal group. As a whole, the quite 
moments on Focus are more interesting than the real metal ones, which is part of the reason why I enjoyed the more 
mature Traced in Air than Focus.<p>Let's talk briefly about the vocals. Yes there are death metal growls; there are also electronically altered singing. Both of 
which are weak and don't contribute much of anything to the overall effect. It is very difficult to distinguish any of the 
lyrics, and both singers are surprisingly monotone. This makes the vocals just sort of "there," contributing to the noise of 
the album in the way that a crying baby contributes to the annoyances of a busy restaurant. It's there, you can ignore it 
if you're strong enough, or you can focus on it and get frustrated and let it ruin your meal.<p>You may have heard that Opeth is another of these "death metal for people that hate death metal" bands. Again, this is 
an over simplification, but I think it's much more true than with Cynics work here. Focus is death metal for math-rock 
enthusiasts that value technical proficiency and experimentation. Even though short, I found myself happy that it ended 
when it did. <p>There are a lot of sounds crammed into this 35 minute album, and if you're interested in instrumental hard rock/metal, 
then you've found a great album with some amazing playing. That's with the notable caveat that you can tolerate a very 
noisy and structure less album that lacks emotional touchstones or identifiable lyrics. As a fan of Prog Archives, that's 
probably OK with you, but be warned: Focus will probably not jump out at the average listener or beg for repeat listening. 
It's an album that happens whether you want it to or not, and doesn't make much appeal to invite the listener to the 
party. <p>Songwriting: 3 - Instrumental Performances: 4 - Lyrics/Vocals: 1 - Style/Emotion/Replay: 2

Coming in times where progressive metal was just experiencing its genesis, Miami-based metal act Cynic happened to release a very challenging, controversial and different album. Hailing from the US extreme metal scene, the band has been gaining experience and prominence since 1987, packing all of their skills and impressions and explosively utilizing them to create this crazy album. <p>The first and most obvious aspect of the sound of 'Focus', is the similarity to 80s King Crimson which, as I presume, must have been somewhat of a blueprint on where the band should head to, as the album carries a lot of resemblance to 'Discipline'.<p>Of course, this is all broken through their extreme metal prism, with all the bruting, technical riffs and almost guttural vocals. But this still does not describe the full sonic picture. There is a lot of experimentation here, a strong jazz inclination, mainly by bassist Sean Malone, and if metal fusion was a thing, this album would have been a perfect fit.<p>The song structures also do not follow the usual death/extreme metal standards; instead, the band lets the songs to unveil as they play. An interesting moment is the 'robotic' vocals achieved through a vocoder-type effect, which if I understand correctly, Paul Masvidal did because of the danger of losing his voice. It sounds strange, even appalling at first, I must admit, but at the same time it is different and unexpected, and as the music plays on, it takes a more meaningful form; Also, I really can't think of another extreme metal band that incorporated such a thing into their music and in the end it sounded comprehensible.<p>In this regard, both vocalists fit quite well with the music, and they use their voices more like instruments, rather than to show off a certain skill or a style of singing. (keyboard player Tony Teegarden provides the death growls)<p>A rather spectacular playing can also be appreciated from drummer Sean Reinert and guitarists Jason Gobel and Paul Masvidal, who I already mentioned. The songs vary from catchy (yes, this description fits some of the songs here, especially the opening track) to very aggressive and fast-paced (like 'Celestial Voyage' or 'The Eagle Nature') to purely experimental numbers (like 'Sentiment', 'I'm but a Wave to' or 'Textures'), and most importantly they work very well as a whole, making the album an enjoyable experience.<p>The initial negative reaction to this was the reason for the band to split up quickly after 'Focus' came to life which only goes to show that when something is different and it provokes our perception, it gets rejected. However, this album is appreciated today and for good reasons, it is so inventive and original! No one really does progressive metal the way Cynic did it on 'Focus'.

It plays just like Crimson, except it isn't Crimson: 7/10

Mixing a small dose of electronic music on a death metal sonority makes a futuristic extreme metal of some sort that,

I had first heard of the band Cynic from friends. When I started to venture deep into the 
genre of death metal a long long time ago...erm, two years ago (back when I hated most of

"Focus" was really different from anything else released within the extreme metal scene of the early
90s, and, like Death and Atheist, Cynic managed to come up with something unique and ahead of its
time. In fact, "Focus" was som much ahead of its time that a lot of people just didn

just death metal, mixing elements of jazz and prog rock into their unique style, and

Very outstanding and equable album, unfortunately so equable that you'll  get fed up
