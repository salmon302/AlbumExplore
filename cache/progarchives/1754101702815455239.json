  "biography": "Eskaton biography\n\nFounded in Paris, France in 1970 - Disbanded in 1985 - Reformed in 2011\n\nFormed in 1970, the ESKATON KOMMANDKESTRA continued the Zeuhl tradition spearheaded by Christian Vander's MAGMA.  In an move towards accessibility they discard the Kobaian lyrics, opting instead for their native French.  In 1974 original members Xavier de Raymond (Fender piano), Gerard Konig (drums), Marc Rosenberg (bass guitar), and Alain Blesing (guitar) are joined by Paule Kleynnaert (vocals), Amara Tahir (vocals), Eris Guillaume (keyboards), and Andre Bernardi (guitar) becoming simply ESKATON.\n\n1979 saw the release of their first single \"Musique Post Atomique\", and the recording of their first album \"4 Visions\" (which would remain unreleased until 1981).  Personnell changes (Alain Blessing, Eric Guillaume and Xavier de Raymond out, Gilles Rozenberg and MALICORNE's violinist Patrick Lemercier in) resulted in shorter songs, tighter arrangements and their next release, 1980's \"Ardeur\".  In 1983 after the addition of synthesizers into their arrangements, and a move away from their more traditional Zeuhl sound, ESKATON recorded their last release \"Fiction\".  In 1984 Gilles Rozenberg left the group, and the remaining members recorded their last album \"I Care\", which was never released.\n\nNow 20 years later, ESKATON remains one of Zeuhl's brightest moments, and their album \"4 Visions\" (released on CD in 1995 through Sweeden's Ad Perpetuam Memoriam label) is a masterpiece of the entire genre.\n\n: : : Tyler Chovski, USA : : :",
