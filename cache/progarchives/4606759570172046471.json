      "text": "Now known as M Efekt, this group is almost entirely rebuilt from scratch from its previous incarnation of 73 (even if the album was released in 75) around Hladic and Cech, welcoming ex Collegium Musicum Fedor Freso on bass and Synkopy61 Oldrich Vesely keyboardist. The quartet now formed some sort of CzechMoravianSlovakian supergroup, modifying their sound to a very Yes-like soundscape. Generally known as their better works among progheads, this writer can't help but preferring their more fusion-esque album like their 73 album. While I have yet to see this album in Cd format with its original red & orange artwork instead of this bland b&w photo, this album IS indeed one of ME's best, because while being sort of derivative, ME manages to sound like their own group with its own sound.With a very pleasant start with the 10-min Vysoka track, the group manages to foray through a large panel of moods and ambiances without sounding like \"going through the motions\", and it shows in the group's enthralling music. The shorter (relatively) Pada Rodenska is an absolutely fantastic Moravian folk song interrupted by some bold and daring Daffy/Donald Duck-like synth noises, but the track is probably the most memorable. Closing the album's first side is the Popoludni track is a bit jazzier than the rest of the album but closing weird synthsThe sidelong title-track \"epic\" is a slow starter, with some multi-voiced lines, sending us towards Yes and early Soft Machine, finally lifting off around the 9-min mark, when the group takes Yes and Genesis-like unison march and adapt it to Slavic charms. The track gets lost a bit in a lengthy slower passage before returning to the early opening passages of the track. Considering the 19-min+ of the track, it seems this track could've been held to some 12 mins without losing a note, the useless expansion stopping this track from being of epic proportions. I find that ME's vocal delivery on this album is very much Italian-like, but timbre-wise, it sounds like a cross of Jon Anderson and Ian Gillan, if you can picture that.The Cd re-issue comes with one bonus track, the harder-edged almost 7-min Golem, which would fit the album superbly if it had been better sung, but overall it is a very worthy addition. Almost quite as good as their 73 album, but quite different as well, you can easily jump on thios album, if you are into a symphonic mood."

      "text": "That Radim Hlad\ufffdk is Czech Steve Howe ? That bass is very great here ? Let's see if these rumours are true.Partially, this is very symphonic album. Not like their 1975 one which is great too, but in different way. Here, you can enjoy every sound produced, close your eyes and dream. You won't even notice that second track is Czech (in fact dialect of Czech, Moravian language) folklore song, performed in \"this\" style. Well, maybe it's Slovakian (they're very similar). I was little bit afraid of last track, so called epic. But even first minutes were not masterpiece, towards the end, it become one of the most original (so new sound), but still interesting LP side.5(-) guys, one of the best of Czech 70's, but I wasn't expecting less from Modr\ufffd Efekt."

      "text": "I wasn't blown away like I hoped I would be but this is very good music regardless. Not as good as say SBB or FERMATA's best albums, and I mention them because they're all in the same ballpark when it comes to music style. Anyway this is top notch playing with some inventive arrangments making this a must have.\"Vysoka Stolicka, Dlhy Popol\" settles in with organ before a minute. Drums join in as it builds. Nice prominant bass here too. Guitar after 3 minutes. A calm 4 1/2 minutes in with synths. A classical vibe 6 1/2 minutes in then the guitar returns and it's outstanding. Great section. \"Ej, Pada Rosenka\" builds to an impressive instrumental display then it settles with vocals. Beautiful guitar work before 4 minutes with crisp drumming and throbbing bass lines. Gorgeous. Vocals come in as it settles again late.\"V Sobotu Popoludni\" sounds amazing with huge bass lines. It picks up with guitar before 1 1/2 minutes. Synths follow. Check out the guitar before 3 minutes. There's that bass again. \"Svitanie\" is the side long closer. Atmosphere to opens. Vocals before 4 1/2 minutes as the atmosphere continues. Finally it comes to life 7 1/2 minutes in with drums then guitar leading the way. The guitar is lighting it up 9 1/2 minutes in. More killer guitar after 13 minutes. It's spacey with string synths after 16 minutes. The guitar solos beautifully as drums and bass support. Vocals are back before 18 minutes as it becomes atmospheric again like the start of this song.A solid 4 stars."

      "text": "This is my second album by Modry Efekt and I am pleasently surprised, yet again. It is a step forward, in some ways, from the previous effort. The previous album was in many ways very hard rock or heavy prog in it's sound and composition, while \"Svitanie\" is more symphonic and in some respecs more elaborate and complex.My favorite track is \"Ej, pad', pad' rosenka\". I have no idea what it means but I do understand the music. Excellent playing, great organ and a guitar solo to die for. The track mixes heavier sounds with great subtlety and sensibility. It is a track I cannot stop listening to.The first four tracks are all great and provides the listener with symphonic, complex yet instant prog. The jazz rock of the album before is almost gone, giving way for the sound of the last years of Modry Efekt. I do hear echoes of Yes but also other bands of the genre, like Exodus. Great stuff, retaining a true personality of it's own.The title track begins really interesting but grows into a blues workout which I do not approve of. I am not impartial to blues. On the contrary. It is simply so that blues performed in this way, although it is the roots of the band, belongs somewhere else. The track becomes a blues number dressed in a framework of prog. It hides the brilliance that so obviously is there. Shame, really. I may change my mind but at the moment I am not amused.Overall, though, \"Svitanie\" is yet again a great album from a great band. Easily four stars. More symphonic than the previous, which shows just how progressive this band was. Amazing stuff!"

      "text": "Comprised of four pieces of grandly symphonic, occasionally complex, predominantly vocal free and endlessly melodic prog rock ranging between four and nineteen minutes, `Svitanie' is a (mostly) instrumental prog fans dream come true. Hailing from Czechoslovakia, Blue Effect/Modry Efekt, calling themselves simply M Efekt by the time this sixth album came around in 1977, rarely fall back on inane padded jamming, instead moving through a range of carefully composed and varied musical passages. Think of a more restrained Finch that doesn't mind the odd ambient break, or alternatively a harder rocking version of Focus without the classical bombast driven by fiery and ragged Steve Howe (Yes) flavoured electric guitar runs. Elements of funk and jazz/fusion also show up, frequently brought to life by tons of Hammond, Mellotron and Fender Rhodes flourishes.Many sections of ten minute opener `Vysoka...' is fuelled by both Radim Hladik's urgent, almost manic electric guitar runs and Oldrich Vesely's regal church organ pomp, bristling Mellotron veils and electric piano prettiness. This confident and tasteful piece is loaded with memorable themes, a range of tempos and moods with stop-start blasts of power, and even a few brief whimsical and light-footed moments remind of Gentle Giant and Fruupp, and Vlado Cech's drumming is like a ferocious storm that takes hold of your attention. `El, Pada...' is a drifting organ lament, with plenty of stirring and highly emotional electric guitar soloing throughout and a short dignified raspy vocal. `V Sobotu...' is a quick fusion by way of ELP-styled instrumental, with super thick Hammond organ, wild thunderstorm drumming and Fedor Freso's punishing reverberating bass around quirky electronics and some wailing electric guitar noise.Lots of build and slowly unwinding atmosphere in the side long title track. Eerie droning ambient electronics, rising cymbal tension and sustained Hammond mystery ebbs and flows against the listener likes waves on a beach shore. After a brief vocal passage, the piece lurches to life with some dirty swaggering treated bluesy electric guitar soloing, reminding of both Krokodil's `An Invisible World Revealed' and some Man albums. The bass rumbles like a damn earthquake erupting inside your speakers, the piece twists with frenetic noisy Hammond spirals, nimble jazzy electric guitar licks and a powerful climax.Without a doubt, M. Efekt's `Svitanie' is truly sumptuous symphonic frequently instrumental brilliance, and fans of Finch's `Glory of the Inner Force', Focus' `Focus III', the Sebastian Hardie albums and maybe Schicke Fuhrs and Frohling's `Symphonic Pictures' should track this one down right away. It's also now available in a limited double CD package along with Gattch's breezy and easy to enjoy self titled work from 1972, so there's no better excuse to rediscover this gem, and learn to quickly treasure it.Four and a half stars.(thanks to fellow Prog Archives member Sagi for insisting I keep at this one, it's proven to be a wonderful addition to my collection that I can't get enough of!)"

      "text": "The peak period of Blue Effect's career saw them wavering somewhere in the hazy border region between progressive rock and jazz fusion; on Svitanie, they seem deeper in more traditional prog rock territory than on either the preceding album (Benefit of Radim Hladik) or succeeding album (Svet Hledacu). Working in an instrumental prog territory that borders fellow Euro-prog workhorses like SBB or Finch, with perhaps some touches of Yes or Camel here and there, the album mostly consists of a series of traded solos between Radim Hlad\ufffdk on guitar and Old\u0159ich Vesel\ufffd on keyboards, the duo driving each other to further creative heights."

      "text": "Now here's a good eclectic prog group not every-one knows about; Blue Effect from Czechoslovakia (during the communist regime) grew from a psychedelic rock band into a brass-rock group (the two Nova Synteza albums) into a full-blown progressive rock group - not unlike a group like SBB from Poland. Soundwise this album reminds a bit of Focus during their 'Hamburger Concerto' phase. I hear Influences from jazz (rock), classical, church music and few, but effective vocals. Some moments remind a bit of Gentle Giant's first three albums. The Finnforest debut also comes to mind as a good reference. By now guitarist Radim Hlad\ufffdk sounds like he could play as well and as fierce as Jan Akkerman on his Les Paul. The keyboards, organs and synths by Old\u0159ich Vesel\ufffd deserve a volume boost in the mix, but they are very tasteful and effective. The first ten minute instrumental track 'High Chair, Long Ashes' has the band showing its variety in influences and musical prowess. Blue Effect becomes more effective when it comes to songwriting and setting a majestic atmosphere on the second track 'Dew Is Falling, Falling' with beautiful pastoral vocals. The blues guitar of Hlad\ufffdk shines brightly here on a chord progression that could have been written by PFM. Lovers of the ARP string synths are also in for a treat. 'On Saturday Afternoon', the last piece on the first side show the band in an exciting fusion rock mode reminding me of Focus, SBB and Mahavishnu. The second side is reserved for the epic 'Svitanie' or 'Dawning'. This is a particularly interesting mix of styles with slow-pace blues as its backbone, yet it sounds distinctively progressive in its execution. The pastoral opening section reminds me a bit of Focus' 'Eruption', and not only because of the in-fading guitar of Hlad\ufffdk. On this track the bass guitar of Fedor Freso plays a more melodic role. Its quite interesting how this track has a low pace for most of its running time and stays exciting all the same. In conclusion, this is a very strong eclectic prog album and fans of seventies prog should really consider getting a copy of this. Right now there's a new vinyl print on the Opus label that sounds fine."

      "text": "Despite carrying forward only two of the band's founding members, this is the sixth studio album using the \"Blue Effect / Modry Efekt\" monikers.1. \"Vysok\ufffd Stoli\u010dka, Dlh\ufffd Popol / High Chair, Long Ashes\" (10:12) sounds like a cross between early (pre-Wakeman) Yes and early Emerson, Lake and Palmer with some strains of Focus, Eloy, Hawkwind, Nektar, and Camel (and even a little Gentle Giant and Colosseum) thrown in there in equal parts. A song that seems to have thoughtful construction but at times may not express a cohesive, coherent purpose--often feels incomplete or unfinished--as if they were waiting for the arrival of one more band member who might provide the \"missing piece\" that would/could make this feel complete. Nice sound--with great engineering--of nice performances; it just feels as if it's lacking . . . a purpose, a raison d'\ufffdtre. (17.875/20)2. \"Ej, Pad\ufffd, Pad\ufffd Rosenka / Dew Is Falling, Falling\" (6:36) a FOCUS-like opening with some searing Steve Howe-like guitar flurries turns even more FOCUS-like when the band settles into a church-like organ-based vocal section at the end of the first minute. The sound and styles of Radim Hlad\ufffdk's guitar wavers between those of 1972 Robert Fripp and 1972 Jan Akkerman. The singer's voice sounds a bit strained. All in all it is still an impressive and enjoyable song. (9/10)3. \"V Sobotu Popoludn\ufffd / On Saturday Afternoon\" (4:15) the band starts off in third gear and then proceeds to build a cool BILLY COBHAM-like tune. The insistence of the tandem bass-and-drum lines is clear and undeniable. The next motif sounds a lot like some of Italian band AREA's driving music from Crac! or even some of the peak J-RF from the likes of Lenny White or Tony Williams circa 1975-6. My favorite song on the album (probably because it is really the one that is the most genuinely founded in Jazz-Rock Fusion). (10/10)4. \"Svitanie / Dawning\" (19:35) long, prolonged spacious organ and bass guitar intro is supported by electric guitar, synth, and cymbal incidentals. I like this! It's like a church processional. Radim's volume-controlled guitar notes are quite Jan Akkerman-like. The vocals and synth work that arrives in the fourth minute and builds into some YES-and- JON ANDERSON-like sounds is pretty cool--especially if you don't mind such blatant imitation of the great Brits. Here one can recognize that those volume-controlled guitar notes are really more akin to Steve Howe's work. At the end of the sixth minute there is a spacious bridge to a new variation of the organ-and-bass motif, with more gentle and sporadic cymbal support before Fedor leads the song into a different direction--one that become more blues-rock based. The blues rock motif provides Radim the impetus and inspiration for a pretty awesome bottleneck solo on his guitar (though it could be a pedal steel guitar). Then there is a patch with some chunky bass and drum soloing. The sound quality throughout is impeccable even if this is not my favorite style or sound of music (and not even close to what I consider \"Jazz-Rock Fusion\"). The guitar soloing turns full-on rock 'n' roll. At the 11-minute mark acoustic guitar takes over the lead play over bass chords and new church organ sounds. Nice play from Radim. The next solo (in the thirteenth minute) still feels like guitar, only one that is very uniquely effected. Then, in the fourteenth minute, Radim bursts out with his loudest Jan Akkerman sound to try to outrun the master. In the fifteenth minute there are multiple instruments all soloing against, with, and off of one another for very short bursts of time, with Radim switching from sound to sound until settling onto a trumpet-like volume-controlled sound for the rest of that minute, and then moving back to some sounds that are quite familiar to us lovers of JAN AKKERMAN's work on \"Answers? Questions! Questions? Answers!\" I like Radim's ballsy inspiration. He's obviously quite talented. Even though very pleasant group vocals enter in the 19th minute to help bookend and guide the song to an end, the song seems too blatantly set up for Radim to rather-conceitedly show off his skills (and toys). (17.75/40)Total Time 40:38I just have to say that if this is Jazz-Rock Fusion then so is Focus, Yes, Lark's Tongues in Aspic, and \ufffdnglag\ufffdrd.A/five stars; though not necessarily fresh or unique music, I cannot deny the masterpiece quality of the performances and skills displayed on this album. The bulk of this music, however, feels more like skilled progressive rock music than Jazz-Rock Music."

      "text": "Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.
