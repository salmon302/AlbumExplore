  "name": "YES",
  "genre": "Symphonic Prog",
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "biography": "Active since 1968 with varying formations - Two major hiatus between 1981-1983 and 2004-2008\n\nYES formed in London (UK) in 1968 with\n\nJon ANDERSON\n\n(vocals),\n\nChris SQUIRE\n\n(bass, vocals),\n\nPeter BANKS\n\n(guitar, vocals), Tony KAYE (keyboards), and\n\nBill BRUFORD\n\n(drums). Well-known and influential mainstream progressive from the 1970's, and still around in some form ever since, they were highly influential in their heyday, especially notable for the really creative \"Relayer\", which included at the time Swiss keyboardist\n\nPatrick MORAZ\n\nwho replaced\n\nRick WAKEMAN\n\nDuring the 1970s, YES pioneered the use of synthesizers and sound effects in modern music. Driven by Jon's artistic vision, they produced such timeless, symphonic-rock masterworks as \"Roundabout,\" \"Close To the Edge,\" and \"Awaken\". In the 1980s, YES pushed new digital sampling technologies to their limits, selling millions of records and influencing a generation of digital musicians with classics like \"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\" and \"Rhythm Of Love\". Moving through the 1990s and into the new millennium, the band keeps expanding its boundaries by using the latest hard-disk recording techniques and, most recently, working with a full orchestra to create their genre-defying music.\n\nYES gained large popularity with their brand of mysticism and grand-scale compositions. \"Fragile\" and \"Close to the Edge\" are considered their best works as it's symphonic, complex, cerebral, spiritual and moving. These albums featured beautiful harmonies and strong, occasionally heavy playing. Also, \"Fragile\" contained the popular hit song \"Roundabout\". This was followed by the controversial \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" LP, which was a double album consisting of only four 20-minute length suites centering on religious concepts. Also, \"Relayer\" was their most experimental, yet grandiose and symphonic. They broke up, until the new jewel \"Going For The One\" and its incredible \"Awaken\" was issued in 1977. In later years, YES would go through many transformations. There were other very good YES albums after \"Going For The One\" (\"Drama\", \"Keys To Ascension\" and surprisingly \"The Ladder\") but this is the last great album.\n\nThese albums can be found under Various Artists - Concept albums and themed compilations :\n\nYes - Solo Family Album (1994)\n\nYes - Friends and Relatives (1998)\n\nYes - Friends and Relatives, Volume 2 (2001)\n\nNOTE: Being that the Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman album uses the name YES, we have added their at the moment only release \"LIVE AT THE APOLLO\" to the Yes discography instead of creating a new page for them, all their subsequent records (If there are more) will also be added to this page, unless we receive an official notification from the band indicating ARW is not YES.\n\nSee also:\n\nANDERSON - BRUFORD - WAKEMAN - HOWE",
