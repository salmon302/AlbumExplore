  "biography": "Founded in Blackpool, UK in 1967 - Hiatus from 2012-2016\n\n\"I didn`t have to play it all the time, I just had to wave it around and look good\" -  Ian Anderson 2003.\n\nEccentric on stage yet rather thoughtful, reserved and even sombre at times when not in the limelight, the Jethro Tull image was the brainchild of flute wielding frontman\n\nIan ANDERSON\n\n. Clad in scruffy vagabond apparel, and looking more like an anachronism out of a Charles Dickens tale, Anderson conveyed an old English aura during the band`s formative years in the late 60`s and early 70`s which would persist throughout the band's 40 year career both visually and musically.\n\nBorn on August 10, 1947 in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, Anderson was augmented by a revolving door of colourful musicians over the years which added to the flamboyance of the Jethro Tull phenomenon. Conceived as a psychedelic blues band in late 1967 the music of Jethro Tull has always been dauntingly intricate embracing many styles including blues, jazz, folk, medieval, classical, hard rock along with forays into electronic music, sometimes referred to as \"space age prog\". The lyrics were equally as sophisticated and sometimes reached new heights of grandiloquence commenting on depressing world events such as drug abuse, the oil crisis, modernisation, third world troubles and a deteriorating economy.. Other topics included fads, spy novels, environmental and social issues as well as metaphysical musings. With lyrics and music which ran deep Jethro Tull have often been over-analysed by both fans and critics alike and many of their albums have been erroneously interpreted as autobiographical due to the fact that many of their record covers featured artwork which seemed to depict Ian Anderson's likeness, something which he has vehemently denied in numerous interviews.\n\nJethro Tull can trace their origins back to 1963 when as a young art student in Blackpool, England Anderson formed a band called THE BLADES (after a club in a James Bond novel). By 1965 as a 7-piece they had changed their name to THE JOHN EVAN BAND and subsequently to THE JOHN EVAN SMASH (his mother supplied their tour van) Evan, whose real name was Evans, would eventually become the band's keyboard player for most of the seventies. The band relocated to London in`67, the centre of the British blues movement of the sixties in search of more lucrative gigs. However the band was gradually dissolved after which Anderson and bass player Glen Cornick joined up with guitarist Mick Abrahms and drummer Clive Bunker who had played together in a couple of Luton based bands, THE TOGGERY FIVE and McGREGOR`S ENGINE. The newly formed band toured the local club circuit and the only way they could get re-bookings was to pretend to be someone else, changing their name from gig to gig. Some of the more outlandish names they used during this period were IAN HENDERSON`S BAG OF BLUES (an error on part of an agent ), CANDY COLOURED RAIN, NAVY BLUE and finally JETHRO TULL.\n\nHistory was made in February `68 when the band was invited back to play a second gig at the renowned Marquee Club at 90 Wardour Street in central London. Having been previously dubbed JETHRO TULL by an agent who was a history student, JETHRO TULL ( often mistaken for Anderson's name )  was actually an 18th century gentleman farmer who was best known for inventing a drilling machine that sowed seeds in a straight row. At the time the name meant little but would acquire more significance as the band's career progressed, incorporating more old English folk elements. Also in February `68 a single with their name mispelled as Jethro Toe ( an error at the pressing plant ), Sunshine Day, was released through agents Jerry Ellis and Chris Wright (founders of Chrysalis Records ) on MGM Records with an earlier cut from THE JOHN EVAN BAND entitled Aeroplane on the B side. Copies of this original 45 rpm disc are extremely rare. Although a number of counterfeits circulated, they are recognizable by their large centre holes as opposed to the smaller centre holes on UK singles. Although not as bluesy as other earlier JETHRO TULL work the music is clearly identifiable as that of JETHRO TULL and can be heard on the 1988 20 years of Jethro Tull Box Set as well as the shorter 20 Years Of Jethro Tull ( The Definite Collection ). By the summer of `68 after a residency at the Marquee Club the band had supported PINK FLOYD at the first free rock festival in London's Hyde Park on June 29 in addition to playing at the Sunbury Jazz Festival in August. The latter performance received accolades from the British music press and the band was offered a contract with Island Records.\n\nOnly months prior to the recording sessions for the first full length LP which was to be entitled \"This Was\" had Ian Anderson traded in his guitar for a flute. A natural musician, Anderson taught himself to play the instrument which would become synonymous with the JETHRO TULL sensation. Anderson would also assume a one legged stance while playing live particularly during solos. Later in the seventies he found himself in the hot seat during a press conference in India being accused of mocking one of their Hindu gods, Krishna. He apologized claiming that he hadn't a clue who Krishna was. Nevertheless, he continued the iconic pose which helped mould him into one of rock's true folk heroes. Although Chris Wright suggested that Anderson abandon the flute  Anderson refused and the first piece he recorded with the instrument was a cover version of jazzman Rashan Roland Kirk's \"Serenade To A Cuckoo\" and as it turned out  it was a jazz musician rather than a Hindu god that had more influence on Ian Anderson's stage presence and flute playing that shaped the future of JETHRO TULL. Anderson also had a flair for improvising and borrowed a humming technique employed by avant garde classical flute players by fluttering his tongue while blowing into his flute that would become an integral part of his execution. The album was a heavy psychedelic rhythm & blues rave up (the band was often compared to Cream) and both Anderson and Abrahams shared in the songwriting and vocals. Released in October `68 the album hit # 10th in UK and made the top 100 in the US.\n\nIn December 1968 Anderson and Abrahams clashed over the band's musical direction. While Abrahams wanted to continue on a more traditional blues path, Anderson had more adventurous designs and wanted the band to encompass other styles such as jazz, folk and harder edged rock. Abrahams departed almost immediately and would later form BLODWYN PIG. Anderson had no regrets and in a later interview would lament that  \"blues were my favourite colour until I looked `round and found another song I liked singing \". Meanwhile Abrahams was briefly replaced by Tony Iommi who was playing in the band EARTH (later to become BLACK SABBATH). He remained with the band for no longer than one week which was long enough to appear with the band for a mostly mimed performance on the unaired \"Rolling Stones Rock `n Roll Circus \". Davy O`List from the NICE was also later hired as an interim guitarist while auditions took place. Among the guitarists being considered were future YES guitarist Steve Howe (although he never auditioned) but after two auditions\n\nMartin BARRE\n\nwho was playing with Noel Redding at the time was selected. The band made their US debut with Barre on guitar at New York City's Fillmore East on the same bill as BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS and the first recording to feature Barre was a single entitled Living In The Past released in May `69. Barre proved to be a more flexible player than Abrahams and fit in more with Anderson's musical objectives who was now firmly in control of the band. The two would constitute the core of JETHRO TULL for the next 39 years forming a unique acoustic / electric guitar alliance which endures to this day.\n\nThe first full length LP with Martin Barre, Stand Up, was released in the summer of `69 and explored other music possibilities in the form of folk, classical and Celtic stylings which found Anderson displaying his multi-instrumental talents on such instruments as the acoustic guitar, keyboards, mandolin, and a traditional Russian stringed instrument, the balalaika. It spawned two JETHRO TULL signature pieces, the folky Living In The Past in 5/4 time, unusual for a pop song in 1969 which foreshadowed complex structures which would make up the band's compositions, and another classic entitled Bour\ufffde, the only track on the album not composed by Anderson, which was a modern take on the Bach`s 5th movement Suite For Lute in E minor which is still played by the band in concert to this day. The original 1969 vinyl gatefold cover of the album had cardboard figures which actually \"stood up\" when opened and won the New Musical Express award for best cover that year while the album soared to # 1 on the UK charts and # 20 in the US. Throughout 1969 the band toured extensively in both the UK and US, playing the Newport Jazz Festival as well as the Northridge Pop Festival in California. Preferring to release singles separately from their albums a number of singles were released during `69-`70 charting favourably in the UK. Most of these unreleased singles along with B sides were released on a 1972 retrospective double album entitled \"Living In The Past\" which also featured some album cuts as well as a live side recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City which demonstrated the band's improvisational prowess.\n\nPerhaps one of the best loved JETHRO TULL albums was released in the spring of 1970. Benefit was a prelude for what was to come as the band edged closer towards progressive rock as Anderson continued to develop the image of a modern day troubadour on stage. The music focused more on sullen folk affections in addition to featuring harder rocking electric guitar. John Evan (formerly of THE JOHN EVAN BAND) appeared on keyboards and would become full blown member of the band on the subsequent Aqualung album. A phantom member, David Palmer also continued to provide orchestral arrangements would also eventually join the band in 1976. Palmer, who had been arranging for the band since 1968`s This Was, was formally trained in the British Army and also studied composition at The Royal Academy Of Music and his more serious approach to composition complemented Anderson's more unorthodox self-taught approach. Throughout 1970 the band headlined sold out shows both in Europe and the UK. In addition to playing the Atlanta Pop Festival they closed the Isle Of Wight Festival (hailed as the British Woodstock) with a searing performance on August 31, 1970.  This was arguably one of JETHRO TULL`S finest performances and is available on CD and DVD under the title Jethro Tull Nothing Is Easy: Live At The Isle Of Wight 1970.\n\nIf Benefit paved the way, then the band's follow up album, 1971`s Aqualung, consolidated them as bona fide prog-rock superstars alongside ELP and YES. Aqualung was JETHRO TULL`S  answer to Jesus Christ Superstar and dealt in part  with the glorification of denominational  Christianity and how it obstructed man's  individual relationship with the lord creator which led many to believe that Anderson was a staunch atheist. Musically it sounded nothing like the previous recordings completely abandoning the blues and broadening the acoustic/electric guitar marriage with plenty of opportunity for on stage prancing and flute hysterics. Anderson felt that audiences were coming out to see a show and that musical content wasn't enough and his aggressive stage antics were brought into the fore more than ever on the Aqualung tour. Consequently JETHRO TULL got away with shows which relied almost entirely on the charisma and energy of the individual band members rather than elaborate light shows or special effects. Aqualung was ( and still is ) considered by many to be a concept album while Anderson has consistently insisted that it was just a \" bunch of songs \" although a couple of tracks were dedicated to his ailing father. He even denies that the nightmarish cover art of a sneering vagrant was not in any way an autobiographical statement. Regardless, the album charted in the top 10 both in the UK and the US and several songs Hymn 43, Locomotive Breath and Cross eyed Mary received extensive FM radio play in the US. It was followed up by a massive 130 date 8 country sold out world tour. Drummer Clive Bunker, who departed for personal reasons, was replaced mid-tour by Barriemore Barlow and by now Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, an art college friend of Anderson's and the subject of several earlier JETHRO TULL songs, had replaced Glen Cornick on bass who had left to form the band WILD TURKEY.\n\nThe band was back in the studio recording their next album in Dec. `71, Thick as a Brick. This time there was no question about concept. Anderson had been threatening in the press after the misconceptions surrounding Aqualung that they would make a \"concept\" album and \"make it so bombastic and over the top\". And it was. An almost perfect textbook progressive rock album it was more of a tongue-in cheek crack at contemporary progressive rock bands more than anything else. It was nevertheless an audacious 44 minute social commentary on a young boy attaining adulthood prematurely. It featured insane time signatures and changes in tempo and included instruments not normally heard on rock records such as the xylophone, harpsichord, lute and a string section. The first progressive rock album to feature one continuous track from beginning to end critics referred to it as everything from a suite, ballad and even a symphony. The cover, as with most Jethro Tull covers, actually had something to do with the content of the album and original pressings of the album included a 12 page mock newspaper ( no doubt influenced by the Monty Python television series ) which poked fun at second-rate journalism which even included a review of the album itself ! It hit # 1 in the US almost instantly followed by an extensive world tour with various opening acts including Gentle Giant, Captain Beefheart and ex-bassist Glen Cornick`s band Wild Turkey. The afore mentioned Living In The Past was also released in the summer and fall of 1972 in the UK and US respectively capitalizing on the band's spectacular success particularily in the US where , like many British progressive rock bands of the early seventies, they had become more popular than in their native Britain.\n\nHoping to avoid UK taxes imposed on high income earners the band relocated to France in early `73 and attempted to record a double album in the \" seclusion \"  of  the Ch\ufffdteau d`H\ufffdroville recording studios but were dissatisfied with the overall results and dubbed it Ch\ufffdteau d`Isaster ( a portion of these sessions can be heard on the 1988 20 Years Of Jethro Tull box set and the complete sessions, with some flute overdubs, on the 1993 compilation Nightcap ). The band returned to England and reworked the material into a concept album which was similar to Thick As A Brick structurally, but it didn't contain repeating themes and was split up into four acts or 16 songs with unconventional lyrics and melodies all composed by Ian Anderson but ran as a continuous un-cueable track. It infuriated most critics but delighted fans who ate it up sending it straight to # 1 in the US. Passion Play was one of the more curious albums in the JETHRO TULL catalogue. It was much more esoteric than Thick As A Brick, musically reminicient of GENTLE GIANT at times, with dark lyrical interpretations of the possibilities that man might face in the netherworld. It clearly demonstrated Anderson's familiarity with the works of Dant\ufffd Alighieri, particularly the first part of The Divine Comedy, Inferno. What began as a collection of individual songs during the d`H\ufffdrouville sessions morphed into a full out serious concept album. Oddly, there were some anomalies which reveal the original intentions of the album, most notably a spoken word interlude which is inserted in the middle of the work written by  Anderson, John Evan and Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond entitled \" The Story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles \" narrated by Hammond-Hammond in the tradition of children's stories like Peter And The Wolf and Alice In Wonderland, suggesting that part of the initial draft had something to do with the parallels of human and animal lives. One could analyze, ponder, evaluate and re-evaluate the album until the cows came in. It wasn't one of Anderson's favourite JETHRO TULL albums but it is one of the more important albums in their discography in that it received such a bashing by the press (particularly in Melody Maker and The Los Angeles Times) that in September `73 towards the end of the Passion Play tour a disgruntled Ian Anderson decreed that JETHRO TULL would never play live again.\n\nThe band retreated to Switzerland for a rest and to write a screenplay along with a musical score for a movie proposed by Anderson and arranger David Palmer which never got off the ground because it was deemed to be too expensive. Some of the material became the framework for the next Jethro Tull album, Warchild which returned to more conventional song structures but retained a string quartet as well as Anderson's pensive lyrics. One track, Bungle In The Jungle, received considerable FM airplay and another, Ladies, revisited the folky stylings of the earlier Benefit album. The adage, never say never, held true when the band embarked on another successful tour of Australia, New Zealand, Japan the UK and Europe beginning in July  `74 in Adelaide, Australia and winding up in Copenhagen, Denmark in December.\n\nJethro Tull's 8th album in as many years, Minstrel In The Gallery combined modern rock with classical and folky aspirations with Anderson fashioning himself after the pre-Elizabethan poet-musician.  It was also to be Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond's last album with the band, departing to pursue a painting career; he was replaced by ex- Chicken Shack and Toe fat bassist John Glascock who also occasionally played guitar during live shows. Arranger David Palmer's contributions also became increasingly prominent particularly on the \" Elizabethan \" suite Baker Street Muse which combined a rock ensemble with a string section. Although largely a complex acoustic album it contained a couple of harder rocking songs which showcased the whole band, lyrically it was a dark and cynical album and reflected Anderson's contemporary personal hardships and gripes. It nevertheless became a fan favourite and on the subsequent tour the band reached its high theatrically, with the whole band dressing in suits with polka dots, stripes as well as rugby garb and tank tops and jumping around the stage like madmen. 1976's Too Old To Rock 'n Roll Too Young to Die! once again raised questions \"as to whether it was of an autobiographical nature\" as the title would suggest. Around this time Anderson had expressed concerns about the direction popular music was taking with the advent of punk and disco but insisted that the album, initially conceived as a play by himself and David Palmer, was about \" the cyclic nature of fashion \" focusing on a burnt out rock star who comes out of a coma as a result of injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident and becomes fashionable again. The album loosely followed a series of comic strips presented on the original vinyl gatefold cover. Dismissed as a \"colossal disaster\" by one critic it was not generally well received by the press but some of guitarist Martin Barre's heavier riffing could be heard here as well as some of David Palmer's more elaborate orchestrations in addition to the fatter bass sound of John Glascock. Despite the rise of punk rock and disco hoards of fans continued to flock to see JETHRO TULL in their prime element: the live stage.\n\nInstead of succumbing to the commercial whims of record companies and the masses in the latter half of the seventies JETHRO TULL instead turned the clock back to Old England producing a trio of folky albums, the first of which featured David Palmer as a permanent member of the band playing an assortment of synthesizers as well as the pipe organ. Inspired by Anderson's switch to a rural lifestyle as well as his involvement with folk-rock band Steeleye Span, the largely acoustic Songs From The Wood sounded like Robin Hood and his merry men jamming in Sherwood Forest, full of whistles, mandolins, acoustic guitars as well as the ubiquitous flute. Tracks like Jack-In-The-Green, Hunting Girl and Fire At Midnight evoked the lore and legend of times gone by and the band finally began to receive positive reviews from the music press. Anderson himself likened it to \"a folky window dressing in a prog rock shop front \".\n\nIf Songs From The Wood smelled of the forest then 1978s Heavy Horses smelled of a ploughed field, concerned with more contemporary issues such as modernization and economic change, using the redundancy of the noble shire work horses which were once fixtures in the fields and pastures of the English countryside as an analogy. Coloured with mandolins, violins and acoustic guitars as on the previous Songs From The Wood, another Jethro Tull classic emerged in the form of the heavier No Lullaby which frequently led off set lists at Jethro Tull concerts throughout 1978 and 1979. Other tracks Acres Wild, One Brown Mouse and Weathercock added to the \"rustic\" aura the album evoked along with its predecessor. To Complete a perfect game, set and match trilogy was 1979's Stormwatch which was, thematically, a warning of sorts cautioning man to take heed to his environment rather than economic gains which is clearly stated on tracks like North Sea Oil and Dark Ages, still retaining folk elements with plenty of mandolins, acoustic guitars and plenty of trademark flute. Despite being cautioned by Anderson to refrain from a destructive lifestyle, John Glascock was dismissed from the band during the recording of Stormwatch in June '79 (Glascock's last live performance was on May 1, '79) playing on only three tracks after which Anderson took over the bass guitar for the remainder of the album, driving Barlow crazy behind his drumkit. Nonetheless Stormwatch was one of the most musically complex of all the Tull albums with shifting time signatures and multiple harmonics. Having briefly being replaced by Tony Williams on the last leg of the '78 Heavy Horses tour, he was permanently replaced by Dave Pegg in October '79. Shortly afterwards on November 17, 1979 he died at his home due to complications following heart surgery which coincided with the third to last gig of the Stormwatch tour. This was considered by many to be the quintessential period of the band and it also signalled the end of an era.\n\nDuring the lull which followed  the Stormwatch tour Ian Anderson proposed a solo album to be entitled simply \"A\" ( after the initial of his last name ), inviting keyboardist / violinist Eddie Jobson as a collaborator who had previously played with Frank Zappa's band, Curved Air, Roxy Music and more recently supergroup UK. Martin Barre was also invited to contribute to a couple of tracks but ended up on the entire record as was JETHRO TULL bass player Dave Pegg. Drummer Mark Craney, who had played on Jean-Luc Ponty's excellent \" Imaginary Voyage \" album, was referred to Anderson by Jobson. The level of musicianship was no doubt retained but there were only scant reminders of the pastoral atmospheres and folky musings of earlier JETHRO TULL work. Gone also was the scruffy attire which defined JETHRO TULL on the live stage in favour of clinical white jumpsuits which made the band look more like DEVO than folk-rockers .Perhaps these changes came about amidst Anderson's desire to distance himself from the persona he had created for himself in JETHRO TULL His pensive lyrics continued to prevail but the harder rocking music he had composed for the album looked more to the future and exploited Jobson keyboard / violin talents which contrasted with the richness of David Palmer's earlier orchestrations giving Anderson's \"new \" band a slimmed down sound sans any acoustic guitar. After the record company execs heard the demo of the album they insisted that it be released under the name JETHRO TULL which placed Anderson in a rather awkward position. Before he could notify John Evan and David Palmer (devastated at Glascocks death Barlow had already resigned from the band) Chrysalis Records management had issued a press release announcing that they had been \"replaced \". Despite pleas from Anderson for them to rejoin the band they declined, having started a short lived neo-classical band TALLIS. The \" A \" line-up played 60 shows and also featured a high tech stage and, as always, earlier material ( fortunately ) was included in the sets and the band was disbanded after their last performance in Sept. `81,  although Jobson would rejoin the band for a one off concert in Berlin celebrating Bach`s 300th birthday in 1985.\n\nA reconstituted band saw the additions of session-man Peter-John Vettese and ex-Cat Stevens drummer Gerry Conway replacing Jobson and Craney respectively. A return to magical and mystical themes resurfaced on 1982`s Broadsword And the Beast and the music fit in better with the solid renditions of earlier material that the band continued to play live without any reservation. The theatrics and outlandish garments were back as well including a pirate ship stage prop which sailed the band into Spinal Tap waters. The music was a hybrid of folk and electronic rock with Vettese`s sweeping synths creating alluring romantic effects. The acoustic guitar returned with traditional folk music also working its way back into the fold and JETHRO TULL fans were never happier after the mediocre \"A \", the \" Ian Anderson solo album that never was \".\n\nOddly,1984`s Under Wraps with cold war espionage themes veered back into electronic territory heavy on drum machines ( programmed by Anderson with no live drummer ), synths and Barre`s electric guitar pyrotechnics. Even though it was Barre`s favourite Tull album it wasn't a fan favourite and the American press ate it alive and it didn't make it past #76 on the North American charts. Doane Perry would join the band in August `84 for the Under Wraps world tour which would see the band perform on three continents with an orchestral album also being recorded with the London Symphony in the summer of that year before a throat infection sidelined Anderson and the band for most of 1985 and 1986. They came back stronger than ever in the first of another trilogy of more musically consistent  harder rocking albums starting with `87`s The Crest Of A Knave which surprisingly won the award for best hard rock / metal performance at the `88 Grammy`s beating out the likes of Metallica, Iggy Pop and AC/DC.  Even the presenters Alice Cooper  and Lita Ford had looks of bewilderment on their faces when accepting it on their behalf as the band were advised by their management not to attend as they considered it a long shot that they  would actually win ! Two further albums Rock Island (1989) and Catfish Rising (1991) stuck to a heavier formula the latter which echoed their debut, This Was, with somewhat more bluesy tracks.\n\nFive years would elapse before JETHRO TULL would release another studio album with an unplugged world tour taking up most of 1992 which produced the excellent A Little Light Music live album with Fairport Convention's Dave Mattacks and Andrew Giddings on drums and keyboards respectively. Extensive touring during `93-`94 brought the band to such far reaches as Cape Town, South Africa, Santiago, Chile, Mumbai , India and Montr\ufffdal, Canada. Their globetrotting experiences had a profound musical and thematic impact on their next studio album Roots To Branches which took over a year to produce. Bringing world beat, folk-rock, and heavy rock elements together and leaning more on Anderson's flute playing with plenty of Barre/Anderson electric/acoustic guitar interplay, it nodded back to the band's 1970s material a la Thick As A Brick, Aqualung and A Passion Play managing some jazz influences here and there. Their last studio album to date ( with the exception of a 2003 Christmas album which contained traditional festive music as well as Tull originals, some of which had already appeared on earlier Tull albums ), J Tull.Com met with some controversy regarding the cover  which seemed to depict a phallic symbol on the Buddhist in the artwork. Consequently early versions had to have brown paper covering up the naughty part at the bottom portion of the CD. Not a concept work by any stretch, it was significant in the fact that it expressed the group's desire to keep up with the technology of the time and coincided with the launch of their official website on the eve of the new millennium. Interestingly a female vocalist, Njama Akhtar appeared on the title track, J-Tull.Com. The music continued to feature ethnic world beat ingredients particularily the ethnic sounds of the middle east and India; although taking a more simplified direction when compared to most of their previous work, it had a fresh and very up-to date feel to it.\n\nOver a career spanning 40 years Jethro Tull has released over 20 studio albums (including an Orchestral work) 8 Live albums, 14 compilations with 26 members of varying periods of tenure in 20 line-ups in addition to countless illegal bootlegs which have surfaced over the years. Performing almost 2,900 concerts ( and counting ) in close to 40 countries makes Jethro Tull one of the one of the longest lived and defining musical acts of the progressive rock genre. Both core members, Martin Barre and Ian Anderson have released solo work with leader Ian Anderson receiving the MBE for music in 2006, among other prestigious awards in the arts. Current members who are all actively involved in outside projects are Mr. Anderson himself, on flute, guitar and other various instruments, Martin Barre on guitars, session man David Goodier on bass, music educator John O`Hara on keyboards and accordion (who is also the band`s orchestrator) and veteran drummer Doane Perry as well as occasional guests. When time and personal schedules permit former members, who Anderson has maintained cordial relationships with over the course of 40 years, also perform with the band.\n\nAs legendary as their olde English namesake, Jethro Tull are still touring with another studio album on the way. For one of the best loved rock bands ever there is no end in sight anytime soon.\n\n:::: Bio written by Ian Gledhill (Vibrationbaby), Canada ::::",
