  "name": "JEAN-LUC PONTY",
  "genre": "Jazz Rock/Fusion",
  "country": "France",
  "biography": "Born  29 September 1942 (Avranches, France)\n\nJEAN-LUC PONTY isn't only a virtuoso violinist but also one of the greatest Fusion composers who blended different genres with great success and a pioneer of the electric violin, his solo works include very different albums as the brilliant and almost symphonic \"Aurora\" or the less inspired Afro Jazz oriented \"Tchokola\", in other words not only a prolific but also a very eclectic and talented Progressive musician.\n\nJEAN-LUC PONTY started his violin studies at the age of five with his father who was Director of the school of music in Avranches and a violin teacher as well, at the age of 13 left school to fully dedicate to the music, later (At the age of 15) was admitted in the Paris Conservatoire graduating two years later with the institution's highest award, Premier Prix.\n\nBeing Classical trained, joined CONCERTS LAMOUREUX ORCHESTRA where due to the influence of some friends got interested in Jazz. Incredibly his first works in Jazz were done playing the tenor Saxophone until 1962 when he returned to his first love the violin.\n\n1969 was an important year for the 27 old musician who joins\n\nFrank ZAPPA\n\nfor the release of \"Hot Rats\" nd then THE\n\nGeorge DUKE\n\nTRIO for about a year. In  1970 returns to France in order to form The JEAN-LUC PONTY EXPERIENCE until 1972 when comes back to USA to rejoin THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION.\n\nIn 1974 he's recruited BY JOHN MCLAUGHLIN'S\n\nMAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA\n\nwith whom he releases \"Apocalypse\" and \"Visions of Emerald Beyond\" playing a very important role in  both albums.\n\nEven though he made a lot of independent projects before (like \"Jazz Long Playing\" in 1964, \"Sunday\" Walk 1967 or \"The Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio\" in 1969) plus combined efforts with STEPHANE GRAPPELLI and many others\n\nHis Progressive solo career starts in December 1975  with the first of four amazing releases, the incredible \"Aurora\" an album in which he blends perfectly not only Jazz and Progressive Rock as most Fusion artists do, but also adds clear touches of Symphonic Progressive mostly echoes from his early and complete Classical formation, a real gem that everybody should have.\n\nDuring the next three years he completes his essential tetralogy that includes not only the previously mentioned \"Aurora\", but also \"Imaginary Voyage\", \"Enigmatic Ocean\" and \"Cosmic Messenger\", also transcendental for the history of Progressive Rock.\n\nFrom that point he starts to experiment with Euro Pop, Afro Jazz and even getting pretty close to New Age in some cases, most of this albums are incredibly experimental creating patterns of electronic sounds with the help of sequencers.\n\nHonestly it's hard to understand why this great musician has been forgotten by Prog Archives for such a long time, but I think at last justice is being done with his well-deserved inclusion.\n\nIv\ufffdn Melgar Morey\n\nWhy this artist must be listed in www.progarchives.com :\n\nJean-Luc Ponty deserves to be included not only for his prolific Progressive career, but also because his works with giants of the genre as Frank Zappa and Mahavishnu Orchestra.\n\nIf this wasn't enough, he's one of the pioneers of electric violin and probably the first musician to expand the sound his instrument with sequencers.\n\nIf this still wasn't enough, he  explored new rhythms and genres like Jazz/Fusion, Afro Jazz, New Age, Electronic Prog, etc.\n\nJust to add one more reason, he gave a chance to musicians that would form part of Progressive Rock bands like Darryl Stuermer (Genesis) and Philippe Catherine (Focus)\n\nIMO this is part of what Progressive Rock is about, to explore and expand the concept of music as an art.\n\nSee also:\n\nANDERSON PONTY BAND\n\nDiscography:\n\nJazz Long Playing. studio album, (1964)\n\nKing Kong: Jean-Luc Ponty Plays the Music of Frank Zappa, studio album (1969)\n\nLive at Donte's, live album (1969)\n\nMore than Meets the Ear, Studio album (1969)\n\nJean-Luc Ponty & Stephane Grappelli Studio album (1973)\n\nUpon the Wings of Music, studio album (1975)\n\nAurora, studio album  (1975)\n\nImaginary Voyage, studio album (1976)\n\nEnigmatic Ocean, studio album (1977)\n\nCosmic Messenger, studio album (1979)\n\nA Taste for Passion, studio album (1979)\n\nLive, Live album (1979)\n\nCivilized Evil, studio album (1980)\n\nMystical Adventures, studio album (1982)\n\nIndividual Choice, studio album (1983)\n\nOpen Mind, studio album (1984)\n\nFables, studio album (1985)\n\nA Gift of Time, studio album (1987)\n\nStorytelling, studio album (1989)\n\nJean-Luc Ponty Experience (1991)\n\nTchokola.
