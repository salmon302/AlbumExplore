  "name": "PAIN OF SALVATION",
  "genre": "Progressive Metal",
  "country": "Sweden",
  "biography": "Founded in  Eskilstuna, Sweden in 1984 (as \"Reality\") - Changed name in 1991 - Still active as of 2017\n\nPain of Salvation is widely known as one of the fundamental progressive metal bands from the second generation, which came around the mid 90's, but the fact is that the band is one of the oldest progressive metal bands still active. The band was formed by guitarist, singer and composer Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw and friends in 1984, two years after Fates Warning, Three years after Queensr\ufffdche and a year before Dream Theater, when Daniel was only 11 years old. At that time, the band was called Reality, but as Daniel got older he realized the band's name needed to changed, despite the band being basically the same. So, in 1991 the band officially changed from Reality to Pain of Salvation. Daniel, over the years, gave various different reasons for the change of name, but the common feature of all those explanations is the fact that the name symbolizes the balance between things of vital significance, such as good and bad, light and dark, life and death.\n\nThe band had numerous personnel changes, mostly during the Reality period and the early period of Pain of Salvation up until their second album. Since the release of One Hour by the Concrete Lake the band remained fairly stable, with only two important band member changes: when Kristoffer Gildenl\ufffdw, Daniel's brother, left in 2006 due to being unable to attend to rehearsals because he lived in Denmark, and when Johan Langell, Pain of Salvation's drummer since 1989, left in 2007 in order to focus on his own family.\n\nAfter having a reasonably stable lineup for some time, Pain of Salvation decided, in 1996, to search for a record deal with some record label, but first recruited the keyboardist Fredrik Hermansson to complete the band's intended sound. During the rest of 1996 they distributed various demo tapes in hope to get signed with any interesting label. In early 1997 the band started recording their debut album in Roasting House, a professional recording studio in Sweden, and in August of the same year Entropia was released in Asia by Avalon, a Japanese record label owned by the Japanese record company Marquee, with generally positive response feedback, eventually leading to another licensing deal, this time with Romanian label SC Rocris Discs still in late 1997.\n\nEntropia can be easily considered as the band's most musically diverse release up to today, raging from mellow passages to crushingly heavy ones, from complex Gentle Giant influenced songs to funky / black music influenced songs, from thoughtful and calm passages to distressful and energetic passages. Unlike posterior releases, however, Entropia does not focus on one theme or one storyline, having three stories being developed at the same time in the album.\n\nAt the time of Entropia's release, the band started to gain international attention, but nothing like what they experienced after the release of One Hour by the Concrete Lake, in 1998. The album had an ever bigger acclaim and had an even bigger positive reception than the band's debut album, receiving media coverage from specialized magazines all around the world and was considered as a darker Entropia. This album sparkled the attention of InsideOut, one of the major progressive music labels, to sign with the band between late 98 and early 99. As a result to that, the band's previous works were rereleased in Europe and USA in 1999. InsideOut still is Pain of Salvation's recording label to this day.\n\nDespite being considered a masterpiece at the time, Gildenl\ufffdw sees One Hour by the Concrete Lake today as one of the band's least accomplishing albums, musically speaking, and it is not hard to understand why: though being a great piece of progressive metal, One Hour by the Concrete Lake's music is more homogeneous / is not such a melting pot of influences as the other Pain of Salvation's albums.\n\nAfter a short break, the band recorded and released in the year 2000 the album The Perfect Element, part I. The album received a huge amount of praise from both the media and the fans all around the world.\n\nThe Perfect Element, part I showed the darkest side of the band yet, both musically and lyrically. The album had themes such as psychological and physical abuse during the childhood and adolescence, sexuality, drug abuse, love, pain, anger, loss, despair and shame, for example, and the various consequences and correlations those things had with the forming of a person. The music also goes with said themes and unveil and even darker side than the one showed in Concrete Lake, making The Perfect Element, part I one of the most dense progressive metal releases to date.\n\nStill in 2000, the band toured on Europe in support of its album during September and October with neo-prog supergroup Arena. In February 2001, the band traveled for the first time to the USA to play in the ProgPower USA festival, as headliners and in late 2001 the band entered the studio once more to record Remedy Lane. Remedy Lane is Pain of Salvation's fourth album and was released in January 2002, being received very well by the progressive rock and progressive metal community and being regarded as the band's best work so far. Still in 2002, during the Remedy Lane tour, the band was invited by Dream Theater to be a special guest opener for their European tour of the album Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\n\nRemedy Lane is, along with all Pain of Salvation's albums, a concept album, but, unlike the other albums released by the band so far, the concept of Remedy Lane was both lighter (when compared with the other themes used in previous albums) and closer to the audience, since it treated about more earthly matters than previous albums (lost love, lust, the emotional feelings one may feel, human relationship, etc). The album is part autobiographical, because Daniel based the story of the album on an actual relationship he had.\n\nA year after the release of Remedy Lane, in 2003, Pain of Salvation recorded a special acoustic concert for a crowd of special guests, which was released as the live album 12:5. That album was supposed to be more than a simply \"Unplugged\" album: all songs played, despite being inspired in actual Pain of Salvation songs, were actually re-interpretations or completely new songs that were based solely on few parts of the original song.\n\nAfter the end of the Remedy lane tour, the band spent most of 2003 and 2004 working on their most ambitious project so far: a concept album which treats about the nature of existence of God and humankind and how one influences the other. That project would later become the band's 2004 album BE. The idea itself dates back to 1996 and Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw worked on the subject from time to time, but nothing serious or final was done until the period the band started to work on the concept, in the early 2000's.\n\nBefore being recorded, the material that would be in the album was performed in Eskilstuna a number of times in its entirety with costumes, stage props, screen projections and orchestra (the nine-part orchestra called The Orchestra of Eternity). After those performances, the concept and the music was further adjusted and refined and in February 2004 the band begun recording what would be known as the album BE.\n\nBE was released in September 2004 and was the first album to divide the band's audience. That happened for a number of reasons: some fans felt the album was way too ambitious and was borderline incomprehensible, wile others felt the album lacked the progressive metal the band was so known for and entered too deep in the progressive rock field; others, mostly new fans that came from a progressive rock background that was attracted by the album's \"revolutionary sound, considered it the Pain of Salvation's best album yet.\n\nIndeed, BE is very different from every other album in the band's catalogue, musically speaking. In that album, Pain of Salvation drops, for the most part, their progressive metal elements and deliver a very refined and complex progressive rock piece, which included the nine-part orchestra (The Orchestra of Eternity), along with an incredibly complex and intertwined concept which was presented and developed in a very small and limited amount of time, making both the music and the concept appear too dense for some as well as they appeared to be too lightly developed for others.\n\nBE also featured the so-called \"God's Answering Machine in the song Vocari Dei, which consisted in a place where band fans would leave a message for God. People from around the world sent their messages for the Machine and the band used the material as part of the song, together with an instrumental piece. The joint instrumental music and the pleads to God created one of the most emotional songs the band has ever come up with so far.\n\nStill in 2004, the band started its \"embargo\" on the USA due to the policy of fingerprinting all out of country visitors and due to the contempt for the Bush administration, for the part of Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw. The \"embargo\" was actually motivated by the fact that George W. Bush was the president of the USA, since, after Barrack Obama became the president the \"embargo\" was lifted, despite the fingerprinting policy still existing.\n\nRoughly a year before the release of Scarsick, Daniel's brother, Kristoffer Gildenl\ufffdw, was asked to leave the band because he was unable to attend to the rehearsals. Since he was living in the Netherlands at that point and the rest of the band lived in Sweden, it was only natural that he could not go to rehearsals. After leaving the band, Kristoffer have been working on his own musical projects, being the 2007 album Synchronized, from the band Dial, the first to come to surface.\n\nThree years after the release of BE, Pain of Salvation released their sixth album, Scarsick. This album is rather an unique on for the band for two reasons: first, it escapes the pattern of the modern band's sound (which would be characterized by the albums BE and Road Salt), which is heavily influenced by the 1970's rock music (progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, specially). Scarsick, for its turn, gets most of its base sound from the late 1990's and early 2000's new metal, a genre that, by the time the album was released, was already old news and endured a rather heavy amount of negative feedback. Second, the album is mostly song-and-band oriented, something that the band has never (fully) done before, though Entropia go through those places quite a few times. Naturally, the album met mixed reviews since it was released and still does over the years.\n\nAccording to Daniel, Scarsick is the second part of the three-piece concept \"The Perfect Element\". The second presentation of the concept is entitled \"he\" and continues the story of the male character introduced on The perfect Element, Part I. Sacarsick has also different subjects and approaches from the first part of the concept. The latter deals with dysfunctions and psychological problems of the individual, wile the former deals with political and social problems.\n\nThrough the following years, the band would tour in support of their album, both inside and outside Europe. During this tour, their second live album and live DVD was recorded in one of their gigs, in Amsterdam. That was quite a courageous move, knowing that the album they were supporting on that same tour have had so many mixed feedback.\n\nStill during their touring, in 2007, it was announced that long time drummer, Johan Langell would leave the band in order to focus to be able to focus on his family. In spite of that, he would remain in the band until the rest of the tour and until all drummer parts were teached to his replacement, which would be the French drummer Leo Margarit. In 2008, yet another line-up change happened. The bassist Simon Andersson, Kristoffer replacement, left the band. Since then, the band has used bassist player Per Schelander as a touring member.\n\nThe year of 2009 was a rather bad year of Pain of Salvation. Two major projects have to be canceled due to the bankruptcy of SPV, the owner of the band's record label InsideOut: the Progressive Nation 2009 tour, with Dream Theater and Beardfish, was canceled because of the sheer lack of funds. The PN 2009 would be the band's first time in the USA since the \"embargo\" started, back in 2004. Also, the release of the album Road Salt had to be postponed, also because of the bankruptcy of SPV. Although the band was unable to release the album, Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw stated, on an internet interview, that he had more time to work and mature the album, the songs and the concept with that \"extra time\" gained. With that \"extra time\" he also decided to release each part of the Road Salt album separately, with a timeframe of a year separating them.\n\nDespite those two heavy hits, the band managed to take something positive out of the situation. First, Pain of Salvation was the supporting act on the Dream Theater tour through Australia, the first time the band has ever set foot on the country. In the second place, they managed to release an EP, after Century Media got its hands on InsideOut, which would be some kind of preview to the Road Salt album. Thirdly, they were classified to the Melodiefestivalen 2010, the Swedish leg of the Eurovision Music Contest of the same year, with the title track of the Road Salt album. That gave Pain of Salvation the biggest ever exposure to the Swedish public in their career.. They were disqualified on the Andra Chancen, however, and did not took part on the Eurovision.\n\nOn mid 2010, the first part of their newest album, Road Salt I: Ivory, was released. The album brought back the \"rock\" side of Pain of Salvation, previously seen on BE, back to the surface. Heavily influenced by the 70's, even more than BE, the band did everything they could to make the album sound as close as if it was recorded 40 years ago, even under producing themselves and muddying their sound / making it less clear.\n\nThe second part of the album, Road Slat II: Ebony, is planned to be released on the first part of 2011.\n\n(Thanks to CCVP for the bio)\n\nSee also:\n\n-\n\nDial\n\n-\n\nFor All We Know\n\n-\n\nThe Shadow Theory",
