  "name": "CAMEL",
  "genre": "Symphonic Prog",
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "biography": "Formed in 1971  in\tGuildford, Surrey, UK - Disbanded in 1984 - Reformed from 1991 to 2003 and again since 2013\n\nThe roots of CAMEL go as far as 1964, when the Latimer brothers Andrew and Bryan form part of a band called THE PHANTOM FOUR, after gaining some fame, the band changes their name to STRANGE BREW, a when the bass player Graham Cooper reaches the band. But things were about to change, Ian Latimer and Cooper leave the band and Doug Ferguson joins.\n\nAt this point drummer Andrew Ward joins the crew and the seeds  were growing in this new Blues oriented  band called simply THE BREW, and at last in 1971 with the arrival of keyboardist\n\nPeter BARDENS\n\nCAMEL is officially born.\n\nIn their first period CAMEL releases four albums, the self titled debut, which was received with limited enthusiasm by the public, which lead to the change of label from MCA (Who didn't wanted to take risks) to Decca, with whom they stayed for 10 years.\n\nFollowed by \"Mirage\", Snow Goose\" and \"Moonmadness\" (for many their essential trilogy), during the latest album tour, the saxophonist and flute player Mel Collins joins and leads CAMEL to a first radical change in the sound, as well as in the formation because Doug Ferguson is replaced by the Ex CARAVAN bass player\n\nRichard SINCLAIR\n\n.\n\nWith this formation CAMEL releases two albums, \"Rain Dances and \"Breathless\", which marks for many the end of CAMEL'S golden era mainly because Pete Bardens leaves the band and the next release \"I Can See Your House From Here\" is considered inferior to the previous releases by the critic.\n\nFrom this point the lineups constantly changes but the band still releases seven more albums received with different degrees of acceptance, until the last studio album \"A Nod And a Wink\" sees the light  in 2002 (the same year Pete Bardens passes away) completing a large discography of 14 studio releases, 9 live albums, 7 DVD's and several box sets .\n\nMaybe because their style is softer than most of the pioneer bands with atmospheric and light Space Rock overtones their fanbase is not as huge as the ones of the coetaneous and more aggressive bands such as GENESIS (Who in my opinion influenced CAMEL), YES or KING CRIMSON, but CAMEL is without doubt among the most respected groups, and the Latimer - Bardens duo is considered one of the most creative compositional teams.\n\nIf I had to choose one album from their prolific discography, my choice would be \"Moonmadness\" but others such as \"Snow Goose\" or \"Mirage\" are beloved by those who love good music.\n\nAn excellent band for people who love the calmed side of Prog.\n\n:::Iv\ufffdn Melgar Morey:::",
