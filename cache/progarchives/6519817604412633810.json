  "biography": "Robert Wyatt biography\n\nRobert Wyatt Ellidge\n\n- Born January 28, 1945 (Bristol, England)\n\nWYATT must hold a special place in many proghead's hearts as he was at the forefront of the progressive movement from 66 until his grave fall from a fourth story window which has kept him in a wheelchair. Even since then, Robert has been a real prog talent. He had started in the\n\nWILDE FLOWERS\n\n(which split into\n\nSOFT MACHINE\n\nand\n\nCARAVAN\n\n) and held the drum stool and singing mike for years before leaving to found\n\nMATCHING MOLE\n\n(a pun from the French translation of his former group MACHINE MOLLE) but had also participated to many projects involving many musicians at the forefront of progressive music before his fall.\n\nWhile at the hospital, he started to write one of the most personal and intimate album ever \"Rock Bottom\", realizing that he would never walk again let alone drumming. He also took another approach to songwriting as he also realized that he would never be in a band anymore and therefore would not write songs according to the musicians in the group. The following albums will be less interesting for progheads and his discography become erratic. Only in the last years will he come back with new albums, some superb.\n\nWYATT is one of the great musicians focused upon in Prog Archives and every proghead should investigate his oeuvre.\n\n: : : Hugues Chantraine, BELGIUM : : :",
