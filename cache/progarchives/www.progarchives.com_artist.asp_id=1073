<strong>Cynic biography</strong><br />
<span id="shortBio">Formed 1987 in Miami, Florida, USA - Disbanded in 1994 - Reunited in 2006 <br><br>CYNIC was formed in November, 1987 by guitarist Paul Masvidal and drummer Sean Reinert. To finish up the lineup, Mark Van Erp (later of MONSTROCITY) was added on bass and a friend named Jack Kelly was added on vocals thus making CYNIC a four-piece. This early incarnation of CYNIC was focused on making only brutal death metal with primary influence taken from bands such as VENOM, POSSESSED, KREATOR and DESTRUCTION. It is this lineup that would later be featured on the release of their first, self-titled demo in 1988.<br> <br>After Jack left in 1988, Paul took over vocal duties, Jason Gobel was added on guitar and and in 1989, they cut their second demo, entitled "Reflections Of A Dying World", consisting of four songs. All of the songs on this demo were of the speed metal/thrash genre, with even some punk elements incorporated within. This lineup soon began touring the south Florida area and bootlegs exist of them as far back as May of 1988. Soon after, Mark left the band, Tony Choy was added on bass and in 1990, CYNIC released their third demo (also self-titled). This helped to gain them a large following throughout southern and central Florida, as well as their constant touring and cameo appearances in the south Florida area. This new lineup would remain intact until at least 1991. <br><br>At this time, the bands' influences were already starting to change. While they were still listening to contemporaries like ATHEIST, and were still inspired by seeing how "sick" some bands would get to express themselves, their technical, musical and creative abilities were growing, and consequently, they began listening to more technical forms of music. Their primary influences soon included jazz and fusion, such as Chick Corea and Allan Holdsworth, but also bands such as WATCHTOWER and Frank ZAPPA. This change in technical abilities had already made its way into their songs as the band took a great leap forward in musicianship for their second and third demos. <br><br>By the early part of 1991, CYNIC had evolved into a progressive speed/death metal type band, although the band themselves didn't really consider themselves to be death metal. The music had the technicality of progressive speed metal, with the brutality and vocal qualities of death metal.

The music had the technicality of progressive speed metal, with the brutality and vocal qualities of death metal. They cut a fourth and final demo in 1991 (financed by RoadRunner Records) consisting of three tracks. Two of these tracks would, in a drastically different form, make it onto their debut album. In April of 1991, Paul and Sean played on the new Death record (at the time), "Human", with Chuck Schuldiner and Steve DiGiorgio of Sadus. They described their relationship with Chuck as "very laid-back", and were able to help Chuck with the writing by giving him input, which had been missing on the earlier Death records. The result was a classic record, and Death even got some MTV airplay. At the same time, Tony Choy was filling in for the late Roger Patterson on ATHEIST's "Unquestionable Presence", also a great album in its own right, and guesting on PESTILENCE's "Testimony of the Ancients". Paul did some work on MASTER's "On The Eighth Day, God Created Master", and Jason worked with MONSTROCITY, playing lead on their "Imperial Doom" album. All of this guest work helped to enlarge the fan base for CYNIC, making them, according to RoadRunner Records, "...the most popular underground act to never record an album." <br><br>CYNIC was planning to record their first full-length album on the RoadRunner label after doing the Death record, then tour with Death and come home briefly before going on tour again for their own record. For unknown reasons, this didn't happen and they went straight into the Death European tour for the rest of 1991. Their lack of touring the states lead to a decline in their apparent popularity, at least in the band's eyes...<br> <br>CYNIC was now scheduled to go into the studio in October of 1992 with Scott Burns to record their debut album. Unfortunately for everyone (especially us!!), Hurricane Andrew destroyed Jason's house which also housed the band's rehearsal facilities. Their plans to record were put on hold until March 1993. Incidentally, this also interrupted Chuck Schuldiner's plans for the next Death release, "Individual Thought Patterns", for which Sean Reinert was his first choice as drummer. Chuck instead got ex-DARK ANGEL drummer Gene Hoglan to fill in. During this time, CYNIC was working with ex-VIOGRESSION vocalist Brian DeNeffe. Also around this time, a track from CYNIC was finally released on CD. "Uroboric Forms" appeared in demo form on the RoadRunner compilation "At Death's Door II" in 1992 with a note that CYNIC's debut album would be released in May 1993. <br><br>May 1993 came and went and no album appeared. Tony Choy left the band to become ATHEIST's full time bass player and the band had to scramble to find a replacement. After going through numerous bass players (including Chris Kringel more than once), the replacement they finally settled on was <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/Progressive_rock_discography_BAND.asp?band_id=1807" target="_blank">Sean MALONE</a>, an employee of Morrisound Studios where the band had recorded their previous demos. After putting together the songs for the new record, they were finally able to record, and on September 14, 1993, "Focus" was finally released. With over two years since their last demo, "Focus" was a remarkable change from the style of any of their previous material, and quite different than anything else as well.<br> <br>After the release of "Focus", CYNIC went on a European tour supporting PESTILENCE. By this time, they had added a fifth member again, lead singer/growler Tony Teegarden, who had actually sung the death vocals on "Focus" since Paul was in danger of losing his voice at the time. Tony also did the keyboard parts because Sean Reinert was too busy on drums to do them. Due to his schoolwork, Sean Malone could not tour with the band so Chris Kringel toured in his place. The tour was cut short, however, when PESTILENCE disbanded. Returning to the states in January 1994, CYNIC did a few shows in the Florida area, playing the states for the first time in over two years. <br><br>Next, CYNIC toured the States during the summer of 1994 supporting CANNIBAL CORPSE. Their tour stretched over 3 months and covered most of the United States. During this time, the band parted ways with Tony and borrowed Dana Cosley (from a local Florida band called DEMONOMACY) to do the death vocals and the keyboards for the rest of the tour. At the end of the summer, CYNIC had to back out of a scheduled appearance at the Milwaukee Metalfest, due to unfortunate circumstances with their record label, the details of which are still undisclosed. <br><br>After the tour, CYNIC began work on a new album. Rumor had it that they were again working with ex-VIOGRESSION vocalist Brian DeNeffe. However, while working on their upcoming album, bassist Sean Malone left, citing those famous "creative differences". His split with the band was amicable, however, and he continues to work with Sean R., Paul and Jason to this day. Sometime during the fall of 1994, while still supposedly working on the new album, CYNIC disbanded. The members couldn't decide which direction the band should go in and ultimately decided to go their separate ways. The split was amicable and the members remain friends. Following the breakup of CYNIC, however, a new musical concept was born and some of the members re-formed in Miami and created a new project named PORTAL. <br><br>: : :> Compiled by Brian Meloon from various sources Updated by Tim Spear & Jeff Litvak, POLAND <: : :<br><br><B>See also: </B><br><br>- <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/Progressive_rock_discography_BAND.asp?band_id=2534" target="_blank">Anomaly</a><br>- <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/Progressive_rock_discography_BAND.asp?band_id=2493" target="_blank">Exivious</a><br>- <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/Progressive_rock_discography_BAND.asp?band_id=435" target="_blank">Gordian Knot</a></span><a href="javascript:showFullBio();" id="aMoreLink"><strong>read more</strong></a>

Cynic's seminal 1993 technical prog metal album Focus is one of the few albums that defines its genre while 
transcending it at the same time. So, when this remixed edition was released in 2023, it was an essential purchase 
for me. Or was it? <p>With founding members Sean Reinert on drums and Sean Malone on bass now sadly deceased, the Cynic legacy is 
totally in the hands of vocalist, guitarist and composer Paul Masvidal. So, this remix, for better or worse, is purely 
his vision. The first thing noticeable with lead off track "Veil Of Maya" is the change of tones and  volume of the 
twin guitars of Masvidal and Jason Gobel. They are as not as loud and powerful, but are cleaned up so there's more detail in 
both of their playing. Reinert's excellent drum work is more to the fore with a heavier bottom to his manic  
bass drumming, as well as more clarity to his cymbal work. Malone's bass seems more or less unaffected. Masvidal's 
vocoder treated vocals are more prominent and clearer as are Tony Teegarden's growly vocals. And here's where 
the song loses balance in the mix as both were fighting to be heard among the aggressive and almost crushing 
guitars found in the original mix, which made the song so enjoyable. This is heavy metal after all, and this style of 
mixing is prevalent in all the album's songs. Even guest vocalist Sonia Otey's brief backing vocals on the later verses on "Veil Of Maya" 
is mixed down to a ghost like accompaniment to Masvidal's robotic vocals. Interestingly, she's more 
prominent in her brief panning vocal on the follow up track "Celestial Voyage", which suffers from the same anemic 
guitar mix down as "Veil Of Maya". Only two songs suffer less from the new mix, "Textures" and "How Could I", but 
they are not improvements over the original song mixes, just acceptable.<p>The best I can say about Refocus is that it's like looking at a blueprint for an impressive building or looking at the 
model used for a sculpture or painting. You see the all the elements that were assembled for such a fine work, but you're not 
looking at the finished whole. 3 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/3stars.gif" alt="3 stars" border="0">
Cynic is one of my absolute favorite progressive metal bands. They've got a singular sound that weaves together death metal, jazz, and astral progressive rock. Though they have drifted away from explicit death metal after their 1993 debut, their evolution has been natural, and they're still recognizably the same band.<p>Ascension Codes is the band's fourth full-length album and the first since the untimely deaths of founding drummer Sean Reinert and longtime bassist Sean Malone. These two are sorely missed, but the musicians assembled by guitarist/vocalist Paul Masvidal pay fitting tribute to the unique styles and incredible skills of their predecessors. Notably, instead of utilizing a bass guitarist, the bass parts here are all played on a synthesizer, which lends a unique character to this album in the context of Cynic's discography.<p>This album is structured somewhat oddly. There are 18 total songs here, but fully half of them are sub-one minute interludes (and mostly sub-30 second). I was wary when I first saw this, but these tracks are so brief and fit into the flow so well, they're easy to miss. As such, I won't be discussing them, but know that they do not detract from the experience.<p>"The Winged Ones" is the first proper song on the album. It is an instrumental with a gentle, drifting intro. It featuring a descending synthesized bassline, and clean guitar and deft drumming dance around each other in this spacious soundscape. Gradually, the song builds to a high-energy place where guitar and synthesizer trade the lead. As is often the case with Cynic, jazz elements are prominent, but there are also dashes of post-metal in the expansiveness of this cut.<p>Following this is "Elements and Their Inhabitants", which is more immediately metallic. Chugging guitars and Masvidal's unique synthesized vocals signal that this is undoubtedly a Cynic track. The increased prominence of keyboards is very nice here, and the warm throb of the synth bass makes everything feel full and fleshed out in the quieter moments.<p>The lead single, "Mythical Serpents" follows. It opens with burbling synthesizers and light, jazzy percussion. The verses are driving and urgent, and the robotic vocals spouting sci-fi imagery all feed into the extraterrestrial vibe. The song continues on an upward trajectory until it erupts into a twisting, contorted guitar solo.<p>"6th Dimensional Archetype" has strong forward momentum and succeeds at giving a sense of interdimensional travel. It eventually arrives at a slower, mellower place, but it's an exciting trip there. Immediately following this (no interlude) is "DNA Activation Template". Looped electronics open it up slowly, along with especially-processed vocals. It's a spooky soundscape which reminds me of the midsection of "Sheep" by Pink Floyd.However, it goes on for too long and is the one weak spot on Ascension Codes. After nearly four minutes, though, it concludes with an exciting 60-second instrumental jam. The guitar is weird and jagged, the synth bass buzzes enchantingly, and the drumming is nothing short of masterful.<p>"Architects of Consciousness" is another slow-opening song. Electronic elements again play a large part here as synthesizers sizzle during the intro. When the guitar enters, it is speedy and nimble, and the first verse is beautifully pared-down. This song shifts between slow, simple verses and flashy, high-energy instrumental passages with great skill.<p>"Aurora" is a warm song that sounds like it would have fit in well on Kindly Bent to Free Us. This song starts off nearly as a ballad, but by its end, it has grown in intensity with dramatic vocals and swirling layers of guitar. <p>The opening riff to "In a Multiverse Where Atoms Sing" is about the closest Cynic have gotten to their death metal roots in a long time. It even features some unclean vocals in the background in the second half. The song is ragged and energetic, and it's the perfect backdrop for some skillful instrumental interplay.<p>Ascension Codes closes on "Diamond Light Body". Pulsing synths and Eastern-tinged guitar lines feature in the intro to this track, and the intensity ebbs and flows very well. The extra-heavy processing on the vocals add a sense of claustrophobia, and the last two minutes features a huge, majestic riff that acts as a fitting climax to this record.<p>Cynic has never been a very prolific band, but they've always made the wait worth it. Seven years after Kindly Bent To Free Us, Ascension Codes is another strong addition to their oeuvre. It features all their hallmarks of complex instrumental passages, synthesized vocals, and diverse influences.<p>Review originally posted here: theeliteextremophile.com/2021/11/29/album-review-cynic-ascension-codes/</strong></strong></em></em>

CYNIC, a group apart in the extreme avant-garde prog drawer, releases its 4th album, an opus that many people no 
longer thought they would listen to, given the successive losses of members of the group.<p> CYNIC embarks on a musical manifesto where the titles are composed in concept form, 18 tracks interspersed with 
interludes, hovering outros and hanging up the titles with each other. This causes a latent ambient, jazzy, post-rock 
atmosphere which combines in an appropriate way with the CYNIC sound well turned on the djent metal, here 
more calm and melodic.
In fact, the album loses its force of yesteryear, its musical punch by plunging into titles which go along the album to 
merge; the album loses its soul in my opinion and it is paradoxically the interlude titles that give it the musical 
framework to make it a good album.
The sound is more refined, more ambient, more atmospheric and therefore less sticky; 'The Winged Ones', 
'Mythical Serpents' and 'Architects of Consciousness' have that little bit more that changes the pace, '6th 
Dimensional Archetype' is typical djent as for 'DNA Activation Template' the intro made me think that 'we were still 
in the interlude and actually one of the most atmospheric, one of my favorites. 'Aurora' with its ethereal voices one 
of the most melodic.<p>Good album from a singular CYNIC much less avant-garde than it seems but which paradoxically suits me more in 
this new decade.</strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/3stars.gif" alt="3 stars" border="0">
This is quite a strange album from Cynic. Bereft of former members Sean Reinert and Sean Malone, on drums and bass 
respectively (both having sadly have passed away), you know you are going to be in for a lesser listening experience. Malone's fretless bass and especially 
Reinert's drumming were as much a cornerstone to the band's sound as Paul Masvidal's guitar playing and songwriting. 
I'll even go  so far as to say that the late Reinert was one of the best prog drummers who ever lived and was easily in the 
class of greats like Palmer and Peart. His ability to be highly technical while still being able to swing the groove can't be 
overlooked.  <p>So what we have here is basically a Masvidal solo album with hired sidemen. Dave Mackay does the keys and rubbery 
sounding synth bass, while Matt Lynch does the drumming in a more conventional rock style than his predecessor, with 
all of the rock drumming clichés like rim shots and jazzy high hat rhythms.<p>But the main problem is with the music itself. More in the mainstream of prog, with heavy use of synths, the songs sound 
very uninspired in their now spacy atmospheric style.  The second major problem is a group of songs bereft of catchy 
riffs and hooks that was so prominent on past albums. In fact, an infectious riff doesn't surface until the intro of the 
album's 13th track titled "Aurora". By then, it's a case of too little too late. The third problem is that Masdival's weak 
vocals are all but buried in the sound mix until the the album's last few vocal tracks. Masdival might not be a powerhouse 
vocalist, but his voice is pleasant and fits with his song's subject matter of attaining higher consciousness and a peaceful 
repose. <p>So, I can't recommend this album for Cynic fans, but perhaps those who like generic sounding atmospheric space rock might enjoy it, so 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 sounds about right.</strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/3stars.gif" alt="3 stars" border="0">
<em>"Ascension Codes"</em> is the 4th full-length studio album by US progressive rock/metal act <B>Cynic</B>. The album was released through <B>Season of Mist</B> in November 2021. It´s the successor to <em>"Kindly Bent To Free Us"</em> from 2014, although the <em>"Uroboric Forms - The Complete Demo Recordings"</em> compilation album was released in 2017, and <B>Cynic</B> also released the <em>"Humanoid"</em> single in 2018 (the first new music from the band since 2014), and the <em>"Integral"</em> single in 2021. <p>It´s safe to say that <B>Cynic</B> have been through some years of turmoil and tragedy since the release of <em>"Kindly Bent To Free Us" (2014)</em> as drummer/original member <B>Sean Reinert</B> left in 2015 and subsequently tragically died of a heart attack in January 2020. A few years after he left and some disputes over the continued use of the <B>Cynic</B> name later, <B>Reinert</B> was replaced by <B>Matt Lynch</B> in 2017, who plays on <em>"Ascension Codes"</em>. Bassist <B>Sean Malone</B> stuck with lead vocalist/guitarist <B>Paul Masvidal</B>, but another tragedy struck as he chose to end his own life in December 2020. <B>Masvidal</B> opted not to recruit a new bassist, and <em>"Ascension Codes"</em> actually doesn´t feature bass at all. Instead <B>Masvidal</B> hired keyboard player <B>Dave Mackay</B> to record the bass parts using a bass synthesizer.<p>Although <B>Masvidal</B> was always the main composer in <B>Cynic</B>, losing 2/3 of the lineup who have recorded most of the band´s previous material is bound to be a big loss and to have an impact on future material. Anyone familiar with <B>Cynic</B> knows how skilled, unique, and important for the band´s sound both <B>Reinert</B> and <B>Malone</B> were, and <em>"Ascension Codes"</em> is therefore in many ways a new beginning for <B>Cynic</B>.<p>Stylistically there is no doubt that you´re listening to a <B>Cynic</B> album though. Although <B>Max Phelps</B> is creadited for performing additional vocals, the extreme metal vocals are very few and far between. When they occur they are layered with the clean vocals and buried in the mix, which means they sound more like rough whispers than anything else. <B>Masvidal</B> performs his usual effect laden and futuristic sounding clean vocals. The atmosphere of the music is tranquil, spiritual, and mellow, although the album does feature more heavy parts. The complex heavy riffs aren´t the primary focus of the music though, so it´s the fusion influenced rhythms, futuristic synths, and mellow atmospheres which the band have opted to make their focal point. <em>"Ascension Codes"</em> is generally a layered and very busy album, but the great dynamics in the music make it a slightly more accessible release than what it may appear upon initial listens (at least in terms of being a pleasant listen).<p><em>"Ascension Codes"</em> features 18 tracks and a total playing time of 49:09 minutes. Only half of the tracks are regular length (3-5 minutes long) songs though and the remaining tracks are short intros, transitions, or outros. Very few would probably despute that <B>Masvidal</B> is a musical genius and that his approach to writing and performing music is very unique, but even after repeated listens <em>"Ascension Codes"</em> is an album which is hard to crack. For all it´s technical finesse, gorgeous melancholic melodies, and multible layers of intruments and vocals, the tracks seem to melt together into one long flowing listening experience, and a few more memorable hooks would have been welcome. The album has a tendency to become a little too ambient and atmospheric, and just a little more attitude or edge could have made the album a more interesting listen. The whole UFO, celestial beings, ethereal spritual lyrics/imagery isn´t a surprise and fits with the general impression of how <B>Masvidal</B> appears as a person, but again the whole thing ends up a little light weight new age tinged. It´s proabably exactly what <B>Masvidal</B> is aiming for, but a few darker moments wouldn´t have hurt.<p>Upon conclusion <em>"Ascension Codes"</em> is still a quality release by <B>Cynic</B>, but it´s audible that it´s now the work of only one man, and the lack of <B>Malone´s</B> fretless bass playing and <B>Reinert´s</B> creative virtuosic drumming (although <B>Lynch</B> is definitely a capable replacement) do have a slightly negative impact on the music. <B>Masvidal</B> is also credited for producing <em>"Ascension Codes"</em> and therefore there are simply no one left to make a constructive (and sometimes necessary) criticism of his songwriting ideas or song arrangements. A 3.5 star (70%) rating is deserved, although <em>"Ascension Codes"</em> is the type of album which may (or may not) grow on repeated listens, and therefore my rating is prone to change.<p>(Originally posted on Metal Music Archives)</strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/3stars.gif" alt="3 stars" border="0">
It's impossible to start this review of Cynic's fourth full-length album Ascension Codes without mentioning the sad twist of fate that in 2020 claimed the lives of both drummer Sean Reinert and bass-player Sean Malone in the space of less than 12 months. Although Reinert was no longer part of Cynic (he had left the band in 2015), his premature death due to heart failure hit hard the Cynic family, possibly contributing to Malone's bout of depression that lead to his suicide. Faced with such terrible events, surviving band members Paul Masvidal (guitar/vocals) and Matt Lynch (who joined Cynic as drummer since 2017) were left with the painful task to assemble a new line-up and complete the music for an album that had been in gestation since 2014's Kindly Bent to Free Us. Masvidal felt immediately that it was not possible to replace Malone and therefore asked pianist Dave Mackay to perform the bass lines of the album on bass synthesizer instead. The trio of musicians were further helped to put together the record by a small number of guest artists, including guitar wizard Plini (who guests on "The Winged Ones"), vocalist Max Phelps, and ambient artist DARK (guitar textures).<p>The end result is Ascension Codes, a 49-minute cosmic journey divided in 18 individual tracks that alternate between short ambient interludes and lengthier "proper" songs. Musically, the album sounds unmistakably 21st-century Cynic, merging together progressive rock, jazz/fusion, ambient music and a touch of alt/post rock. It follows closely in the footsteps of Cynic's previous LP Kindly Bent to Free Us, accentuating even further the jazz/fusion/ambient influences and toning down the metal vibes instead. The music is spacey, mellow and atmospheric, engulfing the listener in a hazy sea of mesmerizing drum patterns, groovy bass lines, and layered swathes of dreamy guitars and keyboards. The guitar riffs are nervous and angular, yet strangely smooth and immersive. Lynch's work behind the drumkit is simply astonishing, his performance a treasure-trove of clever, hyper-technical drum patterns that are nevertheless always played in the best interest of the song. Mackay's dexterous keyboard playing is also a great addition to Cynic's music, contributing smooth jazz vibes to the proceedings as well as excellent grooves on the bass synthesizer. Masvidal's dreamy, high-pitched clean vocals fit perfectly with the mellow atmosphere of the songs, channeling a sort of futuristic Jon Anderson (Yes), both sonically and lyrically.<p>The album packs some excellent tracks, like the emotionally-charged "Mythical Serpents" where Masvidal's delicate falsetto tugs the right heartstrings, almost pushing the song in Sigur Rós territory. "Aurora" is more urgent and direct, adding some subtly catchy alt-rock influences that make it one of the most memorable songs of the album. Meanwhile, "In a Multiverse where Atoms Sing" and album closer "Diamond Light Body" are pure prog heaven, reaching levels of hyperactivity and melodic sublimity that are reminiscent of Devin Townsend's best work. <p>However, elsewhere the album loses a little bit steam, especially towards the middle where the long, ambient piece "DNA Activation Template" is rather monotonous and breaks unnecessarily the flow of the album. The short interludes between the main songs are also not fantastic in terms of flow. These ambient pieces do not work very well as intros or outros to the songs they bookend, but rather give the record a sense of "stop-and-go" that is incongruous with the immersive ebb and flow of the main compositions. Another complaint I have with the album is that it's a tad too samey and homogeneous. It lives in its own very definite sonic space, made up of mellow and spacey atmospheres that are endearing, but also fail to leave a very strong first impression on the listener. Repeated listens are certainly necessarily here, but even then I sense a general struggle to ascend beyond the album's self-imposed dreamy confines with something that is truly momentous and unforgettable.<p>With a better flow and a couple more arresting songs in the vein of "Mythical Serpents", "Aurora" or "In a Multiverse where Atoms Sing", Ascension Codes could have easily crept up on my top 10 of 2021 albums. While it probably won't end up there, it is nevertheless a very pleasurable album to sit through and will no doubt please Cynic aficionados as well as fans of the mellower, Floyd-infused brands of progressive rock and metal. <p>[Originally written for The Metal Observer]</strong></strong></em></em>

On the last album, Cynic had more death metal, on this one, it's pretty much all gone. Traced in Air is their second 
studio album, right after Focus, which was their more death metal one. On Traced in Air, Cynic opts for a more melodic 
and progressive rock charged style of progressive metal, similar to Opeth and even some Porcupine Tree. I'll tell you 
this, Traced in Air is very good.
<p>
Focus was my first Cynic album. I haven't heard Focus in over a few eons, so my opinion on it isn't valid until I hear it 
again but I heard this album today and it was great. This album is different than Focus mainly because it has more 
melody and progressive rock to it. One thing I remember from Focus is the vocoder processed vocals, which are gone 
on this album, replaced by melodic clean singing. We still have Cookie Monster on this album though, so don't be too 
frightened by the changes made.
<p> 
All I can say about this album is that it's a progressive metal classic. It's a classic because it has all the great progressive 
metal elements in it. Traced in Air is listenable for the regular progressive metal or rock fan who isn't into the heavier 
side of progressive metal, so it'll definitely please more people than Focus would. You'll have to listen to this yourself; 
trust me, it's pretty dang good. Essential progressive metal listening? Yes.</strong></strong></em></em>

Coming in times where progressive metal was just experiencing its genesis, Miami-based metal act Cynic happened to release a very challenging, controversial and different album. Hailing from the US extreme metal scene, the band has been gaining experience and prominence since 1987, packing all of their skills and impressions and explosively utilizing them to create this crazy album. <p>The first and most obvious aspect of the sound of 'Focus', is the similarity to 80s King Crimson which, as I presume, must have been somewhat of a blueprint on where the band should head to, as the album carries a lot of resemblance to 'Discipline'.<p>Of course, this is all broken through their extreme metal prism, with all the bruting, technical riffs and almost guttural vocals. But this still does not describe the full sonic picture. There is a lot of experimentation here, a strong jazz inclination, mainly by bassist Sean Malone, and if metal fusion was a thing, this album would have been a perfect fit.<p>The song structures also do not follow the usual death/extreme metal standards; instead, the band lets the songs to unveil as they play. An interesting moment is the 'robotic' vocals achieved through a vocoder-type effect, which if I understand correctly, Paul Masvidal did because of the danger of losing his voice. It sounds strange, even appalling at first, I must admit, but at the same time it is different and unexpected, and as the music plays on, it takes a more meaningful form; Also, I really can't think of another extreme metal band that incorporated such a thing into their music and in the end it sounded comprehensible.<p>In this regard, both vocalists fit quite well with the music, and they use their voices more like instruments, rather than to show off a certain skill or a style of singing. (keyboard player Tony Teegarden provides the death growls)<p>A rather spectacular playing can also be appreciated from drummer Sean Reinert and guitarists Jason Gobel and Paul Masvidal, who I already mentioned. The songs vary from catchy (yes, this description fits some of the songs here, especially the opening track) to very aggressive and fast-paced (like 'Celestial Voyage' or 'The Eagle Nature') to purely experimental numbers (like 'Sentiment', 'I'm but a Wave to' or 'Textures'), and most importantly they work very well as a whole, making the album an enjoyable experience.<p>The initial negative reaction to this was the reason for the band to split up quickly after 'Focus' came to life which only goes to show that when something is different and it provokes our perception, it gets rejected. However, this album is appreciated today and for good reasons, it is so inventive and original! No one really does progressive metal the way Cynic did it on 'Focus'.

<img src="static-images/4stars.gif" alt="4 stars" border="0">
CARON-BASED ANATOMY EP<p>After giving the metal world a huge boost of more technically dazzling jazz-fusion workouts on its
debut album "Focus" which remains an undisputed classic in the proggy metal section of the
supermarket, CYNIC quickly called it quits and went on a 15 year hiatus at least as a brand name.
Founding members guitarist / vocalist Paul Masvidal and drummer Sean Reinert immediately went in the
direction of ambient laced alternative pop in the indie rock band Æon Spoke while bassist Sean
Malone went the opposite direction into the proggy jazz-fusion instrumental band Gordian Knot. Both
bands released a few albums in the 90s and all was amicable with both Reinert and Masvidal appearing
on Gordian Knot albums however the creative differences were vast.<p>Come 2006 and Masvidal decided to reform CYNIC and played a few gigs around Europe. The magic was
rekindled which led to a new album that resulted in the lauded late but finally there followup
"Traced In Air" which pretty much provided the perfect triumvirate effect of "Focus" era CYNIC
merged with the atmospheric spiciness of Æon Spoke and the gnarled technical jazzy workouts as heard
from Gordian Knot. While the death metal had been toned down several notches, several moments
reminisced of the early days when the Tampa scene was still smoking hot. After "Traced In Air"
things got a little weird. Instead of releasing another album, two years later the "new" CYNIC
instead released an EP titled "Re-Traced" which reinterpreted four tracks from "Traced In Air" that
took the bands sound closer to the world of Æon Spoke than early CYNIC but since this was just
considered a little experimental blip between albums, metal fans just shook it off as one of those
things. <p>Still awaiting a new album with the hopes of revisiting the "Focus" years, CYNIC surprised again
with yet another EP titled CARBON-BASED ANATOMY to emerge in 2011 (11/11/11 actually) with only six
tracks that amounted to only a mere 23 minutes of playing time. It was clear that the Æon Spoke side
of the equation was here to stay when an unused track ("Homo Sapiens") from that band resurfaced as
the title track. Out of the six tracks only three pick up where "Traced In Air" left off with the
remaining three tracks sounding nothing like CYNIC at all, well at least not in such a way as they
are presented. "Amidst The Coals" begins the playlist and upon first listen you wonder if you popped
in the wrong disc as this sounds like some sort of ambient new age music! Yes, an ambient airy
melody takes you into the ethers accompanied by Amy Correia from previous CYNIC albums offering a
traditional icaro which is a magic song performed by Amazonian indigenous tribes in order to provide
medicinal healing sessions.<p>The ambient prayer circle of the intro slowly fades into the more upbeat title track which instantly
shows an uncanny production job of how each track seamlessly flows into the next on this EP which
essentially makes this a six act suite of sorts. Along with the ambient synth sounds Reinert's jazzy
drumming attacks slowly ushers in the vocals which find Masvidal's unique vocal style somewhere
between U2's Bono in his passionate delivery and Toby Driver from Kayo Dot in eccentricity which in
tandem finds a wider range of softer tones that bring the CYNIC sound into higher dimensions but
still no metal! Well, that's what you begin to think until the four minute mark and then suddenly
some heavy chord stomps and sizzling guitar solos remind you that CYNIC is, well at least WAS a
metal band! Perhaps an ambient ethno-metal band at this point but enough to squeak into metal
databases anyways!<p>The track is followed by the Ravi Shankar sounding "Bija!" which finds a sitar and tablas in
conversation with female vocal chants however the melody is the same as the bridge of the title
track and thus the subliminal connections have been made and then it sinks in on what a magnificent
journey CARBON-BASED ANATOMY is for all its brevity! The next two tracks "Box Up My Bones" and
"Elves Beam Out" both deliver the metal goods at last but are in no hurry to do so. Like the other
tracks they begin with slow clean guitar arpeggios and atmospheric bliss before breaking out the
bass grooves, percussive jazz lessons and guitar distortion. If you're looking for a connection to
the "Traced In Air" album then you've found it at last and it does not disappoint however remember
that you are in a cloud city now and that metal is just an after thought. Outbursts of heavy riffs
and guitar solos crank out in full bombast but all in all this EP has demoted them to side notes
rather than the star of the show.<p>As the EP ends with some kind of new age tribute to Enya with "Hieroglyph," Correia now recites a
poem of cosmic grandeur as the atmospheric ambience swirls around her words as if zephyr winds were
caressing Isis in mid-flight. And then a couple of minutes later the whole shebang is over. No doubt
this may come off as a disappointment for those expecting a headbanging experience and that was even
my initial reaction however this is a work of subtleties and sort of grows on you once you just
bathe yourself in all its glory. While the metal bombast is set to simmer, the technical prowess of
the musicians is on high although it does alternate between Brian Eno ambient textures and sounds
more like Gordian Knot than early CYNIC. From a progressive rock perspective, this is an excellent
album but for those who aren't so forgiving when the metal has been forbidden from making contact
with the pedal then you will have to go back to "Focus" to get that fix. While admittedly a step
down from the magnanimous masterpiece that resulted in "Traced In Air," CARBON-BASED ANATOMY is
still very much a compelling piece of work in its own right. </strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/5stars.gif" alt="5 stars" border="0">
It's hard to convey some two decades into the 21st century what a big deal CYNIC's landmark album
"Focus" was back in 1993 when it single-handedly shattered the playbook of death metal and took the
fledgling genre into the world of jazz and electroncia. Part Morbid Angel, part Mahavishnu Orchestra
and part Massive Attack, this Miami based band basically launched a whole new strain of what would
be coined jazz-metal and then called it quits. The consequences of "Focus" being thrown into the
limelight of underground extreme metalheads was that it upped the bar several notches in the
proficiency department and while band's like Death and Atheist were in the fusion game as well,
CYNIC took progressive metal into a completely different dimension with "Focus" which remains a high
mark to which technical metal music wizards still strive to emulate.<p>Despite dropping one of metal's most revered albums onto on unsuspecting world, CYNIC quickly
disbanded as they were working on a second studio album due to musical and personal differences.
Jason Gobel (guitars), Paul Masvidal (guitars, vocals) and Sean Reinert (drums) continued together
and formed a short-lived band called Portal (before the Australian band of the same name came
around), bassist Sean Malone formed the fusion-metal band Gordian Knot and then Reinert and Masvidal
formed yet another band called Aeon Spoke which was more of a pop album centered around an acoustic
emo style. The former members of CYNIC happily went their own ways for almost 15 years but some of
the members were starting to feel that they had unfinished business to take care of in the world of
CYNIC and in 2006 Paul Masvidal announced that CYNIC would reunite to play at various metal and rock
festivals. With no new album the band played songs from "Focus" the band Portal as well as a few
covers and the new song "Evolutionary Sleeper."<p>The new band minus Gobel decided the time was right to resurrect CYNIC and finish the material
started for a sophomore album that never made it the first time around. With new guitarist Tymon
Kruidenier, CYNIC finally released its second album TRACED IN AIR in 2008,
fifteen long years after "Focus." While expectations were cast upon that debut masterpiece as a
reference point as to where the band might develop its new sounds, the fact that there was a 15 year
delay and several other band experiences in between meant that TRACED IN AIR was more like the sum
of all that came before and as the title indicates is more focused on an AIR-y feel as opposed to a
knock your socks off death metal extravaganza. While still steeped in massive molten metal guitar
antics, TRACED IN AIR was more of a light technical display of jazzy chord progression displayed in
echoey arpeggios that set the tone for the eruptive heavier elements to follow and not the other way
around. There were less dueling twin guitar leads and more focus to layering effects of polyrhythms
and guitar tones.<p>From the chaotic swirls of "Nunc Fluens" that sound like the band acting as a receiver channeling
the ethers to like a radio station, the rhythmic chaos slowly coalesces into the jazzed up guitar
riffs that reassure that the band was still in the metal camp however brief they may be before the
unadulterated jazz guitar intro of "The Space For This" sets an overall tone for TRACED IN AIR as
Masavidal delivers his tender clean vocals in a subdued passionate plea, a style that he implements
throughout the album that only harkens back to "Focus" with Kruidenier's growly vocal accompaniments
limited to backing supplement contrasting effects. The beauty of TRACED IN AIR is how it
effortlessly transmogrifies from placid spaced out jazz guitar runs to blistering jazzy fusion metal
with Reinert's drumming virtuosity often taking center stage. As with focus, a feminine vocal
counterpoint finds its way into key moments as to soften the raging rampages of the metal aspects as
Amy Correia takes the place of SAonia Otey.<p>While "Focus" was fairly scattered, TRACED IN AIR is actually the more "focused" album of the two as
the album displays a perfect mix of disparate elements which finds each track running into the next
and the softness and bombastic playing together like well behaved children at a Christmas play. It's
clear that the chemistry was on fire once again and CYNIC crated an unbelievable successful comeback
with this menagerie of technically infused jazz-metal that while not as revolutionary as the band's
first album was unbelievably relevant for the time of its release. Gone are the vocoder effects and
thus this album is less alienating and more intimate but the bursts of angularity are steered into
jazzy harmonies and melodies that keep the entire album feeling unified. This is one that may
disappoint upon the first listen if you have already gone gaga over "Focus" but as i've listened to
this many times over the years, it's one that grows on you in a completely different way. Drop the
comparisons and meditate on TRACED IN AIR on its own terms and it quickly becomes clear that this is
a flawless album that delivers another magic moment in the world of progressive metal and the
production is flawless.</strong></strong></em></em>
