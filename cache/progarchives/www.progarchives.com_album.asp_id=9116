This is Deep Purple their debut album, it contains a lot of covers. The first line-up 
featured Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, Rod Evans on vocals, Jon Lord on 
vocals/Hammond organ,Ian Paice on drums and Nick Simper on bass/vocals.<p>1. And 
the address (4:38) : This instrumental track has obvious hints from CREAM and 
VANILLA FUDGE delivering a propulsive rhythm, fiery electric guitar and powerful 
Hammond organ waves.<p>2. Hush (4:24) : A typical Sixties song with a warm 
atmosphere, vocal harmonies and pleasant vocals from Rod Evans. The Hammond solo 
is excellent, Jon Lord prooved to be a master on this vintage keyboard!<p>3. One 
more rainy day (3:40) : The intro contains the sound of rain and thunder, then a slow 
rhythm featuring Hammond organ and Rod Evans his fine voice, we are back in the  
Sixties!<p>4. Prelude: happiness / I'm so glad (7:19) : The first part has floods of 
Hammond and a dynamic rhythm-section in a bombastic climate, then again the 
pleasant 'Sixties' sounding vocals from Rod Evans and nice twanging electric guitar. It's 
followed by a raw guitar solo, supported by strong drumming. <p>5. Mandrake root 
(6:09) : A powerful and catchy song (influenced by Jimi Hendrix) delivering a compelling 
Hammond organ solo, accompanied by splendid drumming (like Nick Mason on "Pink 
Floyd at Pompeii"). Then a heavy guitar solo, this was the exciting heavy progrock 
sound Deep Purple would stretch to almost half an hour of improvisations!<p>6. Help 
(6:01) : Twanging electric guitar, mellow organ and warm vocals in this legendary song 
from The Beatles, witten by John Lennon/McCartney. Halfway heavy Hammond floods, 
powerful drums and a fiery electric guitar solo save this version from a mediocre 
level.<p>7. Love help me (3:49) : A propulsive and catchy rhythm, the bass sounds 
very powerful. Pleasant vocal harmonies and organ, this music is the bridge from The 
Sixties (THE WHO, THE YARDBIRDS, CREAM) to the heavy progrock sound from later 
Deep Purple. Blackmore delivers some biting wah-wah drenched guitar runs.<p>8. Hey 
Joe (7:33) : It starts with alarm sirens, then a Hammond organ sound in the vein of JOE 
COCKER'S "With a little bit help from my friends", the guitarplay has a Spanish 
undertone, very compelling early heavy prog! After a few minutes this song turned out 
to be the cover "Hey Joe", written by WM Roberts but known because of Jimi Hendrix 
his version. Rod Evans does well but he lacked the melancholy from Hendrix his voice. 
The waves of Hammond organ and powerful guitar interpretation give an extra 
dimension, GREAT! The final part features a howling electric guitar solo, soon the world 
would praise this dark man on his Fender guitar!<p>THIS IS PLEASANT AND 
POWERFUL EMBRYONAL HEAVY PROGROCK FROM DEEP PURPLE!

3 2/3<p>Even if the band is not very 'prog' in terms of the elements listed on this site, Deep 
Purple is an influential band in the genre of Hard Rock. The musicians are as virtuosic as 
a whole as a top notch classic rock band or good prog rock band, especially the 
keyboardist and the guitar player.<p>In this album, they have not found their 'sound' yet, except for the classical hammond 
playing of Jon Lord. They have big influences of Cream and Jimmi Hendrix (And the 
Address, Mandrake Root) in some of their songs, sounding like rock&blues and 
Mandrake Root partially ripping off Jimmi Hendrix's Foxy Lady (yet redeems itself with 
great instrumental sections). Some songs sound very 'sixties' like Hush (neat vocal 
lines), One More Rain Day (sounds like Moody blues), and Love Help Me (a beatlesque 
pop song). There is also a mini epic divided into 2 sections. That is in my opinion the 
strongest song of the album, and showcases the talents of the musicians and their 
abilities to compose catchy melodies. The 2 songs I have not yet mentioned are cover 
songs. Help! is very different from the original version from the Beatles. I prefer the 
original, but the keyboard solo in the middle is amazing! The last song is a cover of 
Jimmi Hendrix, but you don't notice it until that spanish-rodeo keyboard riff stops.<p>Recommended!<p>1. And the address (7/10)
2. Hush (8/10)
3. One more rainy day (6.5/10)
4. Prelude: happiness / I'm so glad (8.5/10)
5. Mandrake root (8/10)
6. Help (7/10)
7. Love help me (5.5/10)
8. Hey Joe (7.5/10)<p>My Grade : B-<p><p></strong></strong></em></em>

What a debut album that was ! And to think Purple will be almost unnoticed in its homeland 
until the In Rock album. Outside of the debate: Prog Or Not, Purple is one hell of a rock 
band and kicked more than one arse throughout their career.<p>Starting out with a superb (and very prog ) instrumental And The Address sets the tone 
right out with Lord wailing on his Hammond organ and Blackmore ripping the strings out of 
his Stratocaster guitar. Hush is the only time England will notice these guys until Speed 
King , but what a superb cover and proof if needed that Rod Evans had also one hell of a 
voice. Happiness is the intro to the Elmore James cover of I'm so Glad (just covered by 
Cream back then) and they do sound not just glad but plainly thrilled!<p>Mandrake Root starts side 2 in a superb manner and this track will eventually become the 
live favorite and become extended to almost 30 mins. Help is IMHO an ill-advised  cover of 
the Beatles and the next track appears to be an addition to it , not anymore succesful 
either. Then comes one of the cornerstone of the album , the Joe South track Hey Joe 
(also recently done by Hendrix) but it comes with a full-blown dramatic sound that owes 
much to Spanish music. The dramatic vocals get a full lift from the suspense tringed intro 
and outro.<p>Although hardly perfect, this is one of those 60's psych rock pivital albums that lead 
indirectly to the full birth of prog rock. Essential as the first Procol Harum , the Nice's debut 
of Moody's Days Of Future Past!</strong></strong></em></em>

I like the nice analog sounds on this old album. The hit song "Hush" is a nice rocker, but my 
personal favorites are the instrumental starter "And The Address". "One More Rainy Day" 
is also a decent 60's pop song, but the highlight moment of this album for me is 
the "Mandrake root", which has very good psychedelic influences in it. Sadly, there's maybe too many boring cover songs on this LP to make it a truly classic album.

I entered the Purple catogue in 1971 with "Fireball". 
It is only during 1973 that I discovered the Mark I era. 
The core of the band is there : Ritchie, Jon and Ian. 
The singer Rod Evans will never be at par. His monocord tone is boring at times.
It is obvioius here that the influence of Jon Lord is enormous throughout the whole album 
(and in the Mark I era which is the only one to be related with prog).
I must honestly admit that I was quite impressed with their first work. 
Some fantastic covers ("Hush" - their first hit, "Help" and "Hey Joe" ) in the style of what 
Yes did it with "America" if you see what I mean. 
They were more a re-interpretation than a cover. 
it is quite remarkable to know that the Mark I wxill be very sucessful in the States :
"Hush" will reach Nr. 4 in the US and sell more than one million copies while the album will 
peak at the 24th spot.
"And The Address" is a solid piece of instrumental music. 
"One More Day" starts with a thunderstorm "like" sound and is a melodic ballad. 
Not really representative of DP's music. 
It is different with "Prelude" : Jon is fantastic on the keys, and the rythm section is 
excellent. This intro to "I'm so Glad" is one of the best moments of the album.
"Mandrake Root" will be a classic live track (exceeding 15+ minutes - even more than thirty 
on Scandinavian Nights - with wild improvs). 
There are some bonus tracks on the remastered version, but frankly they are not really 
worth (Top Gear version of "Wring that Neck" is above average though).
They are live or alternate versions from existing songs. 
"Shadows" was a left over from the studio sessions. Three stars for this work.</strong></strong></em></em>

This is one fantastic album !!!  Along-side 'Crazy World of Arthur Brown' (from 1968 also - 
no other relation...), this Deep Purple release show-cases the sonic extremes of the 
Hammond Organ.  To me, it's absolutely wonderous what this line-up have 
come up with - whilst the Mark II line-up is heralded as the 'penultimate' version of the 
band, I, personally, have grown tired of Ian Gillan's vocal histrionics, though one of his 
later albums, 'Clear Air Turbulence', is an amazing prog-related item with wonderful 
musicians and virtuosic performances, and I really enjoy Black Sabbath's 'Born Again' - it's 
just the same problem as I find with Robert Plant - often-times the vocals are just too 
overdone...but then we have Hammill, who I just envy, one of the best voices in 
history.....  <p>
The problem I find with Purple mk I, is the roughness of the production ;  it really sounds 
sixties, but the quality of the music, the high standard of playing, and the arrangements 
themselves are just mind-blowing.   The album features many sound effects and clever 
over-dubs, giving the album a strong psychedelic feel, Ritchie Blackmore's sound and 
style takes the electric guitar's potential to a higher plateau.  Jon Lord emerged as a force 
to be reckoned with his whirlwind organ playing (with his only major rivals at the time, 
Keith Emerson, whilst in 'The Nice', and Vincent Crane from Arthur Brown... ).  I don't wish 
to ramble on about the the charateristics of each song - the album is certainly a 
masterpiece, depending on your taste, but this LP deserves much more exposure than it 
currently has.  For lovers of embryonic hard-rock/metal, lovers of guitar and organ, and 
for those interested in some truly inventive music beyond the norm.  5 star.</strong></strong></em></em>

Shades of greatness to come. Humble beginnings for the band as half of this album is made 
up of cover tunes. It did yield their first hit though in "Hush"  a Joe South song and my 
favourite on the record. It has a good beat and some great organ work from Lord. And did 
you hear the wolf howling in the intro? The opening song "And The Address" is a very sixties 
sounding instrumental. "One More Rainy Day" opens with a sample of a storm and is quite 
mellow, not that good imo. "I'm So Glad" is such a good psychedelic song. "Mandrake 
Root"  is a blues song with a good organ solo. I like the extended instrumental play and the 
guitar solos from Blackmore. "Help" is THE BEATLES song that they cover 
here, but instead of being a 2 minute uptempo song like the original this is a slow paced 6 
minute version. It's ok. "Love Help Me" is another really sixties sounding song. "Hey Joe" is a 
cool cover song. It has a Spanish feel to it that works quite well.<p>
A good record with some interesting songs, but not essential by any means. Barely 3 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

DEEP PURPLE version of "Hush" provided on this album was one of the big hits during my teenage rocking growin-up. But, only years 
later I found out that this debut is a much more than that. Obvious product of the psychedelic/acid rock movement in England in late 
1960s, it contains amazingly inspired musicianship (if not songwriting, judging by the quantity of covers) by Lord, Blackmore, Paice 
and Simper, while Rod Evans is surely one of unjustly neglected vocalists of the rock scene; if you ask me, I prefer his strong singing 
than the later Gillan's screaming acrobatics during the popular (populist?) Mark II era. <p>"And the Address", "Mandrake Root", "Prelude: Happiness/I am So Glad" and "Help" are all excellent tracks showing enormous 
musical talents of these guys, which unfortunatley were to be largely abused in their later career. The musicianship performed in 
these moments can be matched by the equally stunning achievements of the era, such as the best moments of CREAM, JIMI 
HENDRIX EXPERIENCE or VANILLA FUDGE. "Shades of Deep Purple" is a definite "proto-progressive rock" album by all means and 
should therefore be checked by the general prog community.</strong></strong></em></em>

Madrake Root and Hush are still personal favourites. Like many I was introduced to Deep Purple Mk II and discovered this
album after. 1968 was too early for me to remember and it's always hard to palce such an album in context: comparing it to
the albums in the harder and heavier environment of the 1970s is a tad unfair. <p>The covers of Help (dodgy)  and Help (better) are best avoided. I find I'm So Glad hideuosly annoying and inane, but that's
probably a product of Thatcherism and middle-aged scepticism, or maybe it is inane<p>For the most part the album is unremarkable: however, Jon Lord is stamping his Hammond across the board, and the outrageous
talent of Ian Paice is hinted at. Blackmore while impressive is yet to emerge as the force which is unleashed in Mk II.<p>it's a good album but by no means essential.<p></strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>The birth of Mandrakeroot!</strong><p>We have to go back some 40 years for Deep Purple's debut album. While Blackmore, Lord and Paice are already on board, Gillan 
and Glover have yet to arrive, the vocalist and bassist here being Rod Evans and Nick Simper respectively. <p>For an opening track to a debut album, "And the address" is a wonderfully brave instrumental featuring blistering Hammond 
organ and occasional lead guitar bursts. The organ sound is clean and exciting, any psychedelic overtones being largely 
suppressed by the heavy rock. This is an immediate statement of Deep Purple's prog credentials from the proto prog era.<p>Things take a quick turn towards mainstream when Evans sings for the first time on a cover version of The Beatles "Help". This 
early interpretation may now sound prosaic, but it should be recognised that back in 1968 few people had heard the song 
performed as a slow ballad with a rich organ backing. The reworking has obvious implications that Deep Purple had discovered the 
way Vanilla Fudge were <I>converting</I> pop songs into heavy rock classics, and liked what they heard.<p>Lord and Evans team up to write "One more rainy day", a straightforward 60's pop song with tight harmonies. While pleasant, 
the song is anonymous, offering little indication of the band's future direction. Another clear indication of the band's early 
influences is the cover of "I'm so glad", a song made popular by Eric Clapton's Cream (but not a Cream original). As might be 
expected, Blackmore takes the opportunity to include a workout on guitar for the solo section. Blackmore's contribution to the 
album as a whole is somewhat muted, Jon Lord being by far the dominant partner instrumentally. The rendition of "I'm so glad" is 
preceded by a "Happiness" prelude (helpfully listed as part 2 of the track on my cassette sleeve) which allows the band to include 
another improvised organ driven instrumental workout. <p>"Mandrake Root" (surely not named after an esteemed member of our site) would be developed by early line ups of the band into 
a 30 minute monster. Here though, they confine themselves to a mere 6 minutes. The songs is very Jimi Hendrix like in its style of 
delivery, Evans even doing a passable imitation vocally. The latter half of the track is effectively an early glimpse of the unwieldy 
jam the track would become.<p>Deep Purple enjoyed early singles success with their cover of American singer songwriter Joe South's "Hush". The song, more 
recently covered by Kula Shaker, is transformed by Deep Purple into an exciting up-tempo pop number with a fine vocal 
arrangement. The fact that this is the only song from this period of the band's history to still feature in their live performances 
and to appear on Best of compilations is witness to the longevity of the recording. <p>Blackmore and Evans combine to compose "Love help me", a straightforward pop rock song saved only be a brief wah-wah solo 
by Ritchie. The album closes with a lengthy rendition of "Hey Joe". The true composer of this song seems to be a matter of some 
confusion, with Dino Valente (AKA Chet Powers) sometimes receiving he credit. (Coincidentally, I mentioned Valente in my last 
review of the "Rock machine I love you" sampler). It appears however that the song was actually composed by American Billy 
Roberts, who may have assigned the copyright to Valente to help the latter whilst in prison. The song is also sometimes assumed 
to be <I>traditional</I>, and on that basis Deep Purple conveniently claim the writing credit here. This version is similar to Jimi 
Hendrix's interpretation, except that here the organ plays a much more dominant role. It certainly makes for a powerful ending 
to the album. <p>"Shades of Deep Purple" deserves recognition for the pioneering nature of the music it contains. While by no means entirely 
original, indeed the evidence that they were to a large extent following a path already trodden by Vanilla Fudge is undeniable, it 
must be remembered that this album predates by several years the music made by many of the prog bands who 
appear on this site. On that basis, Deep Purple's classification as a Proto prog outfit is already secured by this album alone.<p>Note that this review reflects the order of the tracks as they appeared on music-cassette.

It's always been a joy listening to vintage rock music especially those that came out before early 70s. This album by Deep
Purple is by no exception. With Rod Evans on lead vocal this was the embryonic phase of a band that later would be called as
the loudest band in the world. The opening track "Hey Joe" (Jimi Hendrix) contains symphonic elements through the organ work
beautifully delivered by Jon Lord. The sound quality was still quite raw because at that time recording technology relied
heavily only with analog equipment. However, the band has successfully composed and arranged the music in such a way that
makes the listeners enjoy it very much. I especially love the way Jon plays his organ in eastern style.<p>"Help" intro falls into the same style with the intro of "Hey Joe". This cover of The Beatles has been made richer than the
original version with more symphonic touch demonstrating soaring organ work, powerful drumming and atmospheric vocal. The
chorus line has been made different and it's really nice. The music interlude showing Jon Lord organ solo is also stunning.
Ritchie provides his guitar in its raw format and makes it pleasurable for listeners. By simple definition these two opening
tracks are prog. <p>"Hush" brings the music into uplifting mood with upbeat music in relatively fast tempo. The organ solo exploration in "And
The Address" of the track is excellent. Nick Simpler's bass guitar lines are quite dynamics and tight. Ritchie provides his
solo nicely. "One More Rainy Day" brings The Beatles style of Deep Purple even though the organ work is different than any of
The Beatles style. Again, I notice Nick Simpler bass guitar work is excellent. "Mandrake Root" is a good track with powerful
riffs, dynamics drums and relatively fast tempo. Ritchie had not shown his powerful guitar solo yet. The music interlude in
the middle of the track filled with Jon Lord's stunning organ work augmented by powerful drumwork by Ian Paice.<p>Overall, talking about Deep Purple album I think this one has reasonable number of prog elements in the music especially
through the work of Jon Lord and dynamic bass guitar lines by Nick Simpler. It's an interesting album in the band's early
days. <strong>Keep on proggin' ..!</strong><p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>

Controversial debut album by one of the most influential bands ever! They're still trying to find
themselves. Shades of Deep Purple is full of great songs, but regretfully most of them - covers.
Here we can find the first and one of teh biggest hit single of the band - Hush. It's not song of
their own, but they had made it famous. Some other famous covers and some original songs. The style
is unformed - rock & roll, psychedelic rock, classical music, progressive rock and blues-oriented
sound. In my opinion, nothing close to their main genre - hard rock. The sound is almost
amateur-classed quality! The vocals by Rod Evans and keyboard works by Jon Lord are solid, but the
other instruments are nothing special! 2.5 stars</strong></strong></em></em>

<em>"Shades of Deep Purple"</em> is the debut full-length album by UK hard rock act <B>Deep 
Purple</B>. When I was younger and the internet was only a thing the really nerdy guys knew how to 
use I thought that <em>"Deep Purple in Rock (1970)"</em> was the debut album by <B>Deep 
Purple</B> and it was only later that I discovered that <B>Deep Purple</B> had actually released three 
studio albums before that one. Imagine the surprise. The original lineup on those three albums featured 
lead vocalist <B>Rod Evans</B> (later of <B>Captain Beyond</B>) and bassist <B>Nick 
Simper</B>. It wouldn´t be until <em>"Deep Purple in Rock"</em> that <B>Ian Gillan</B> and <B>Roger 
Glover</B> would join the band.<p><B>Deep Purple</B> recorded a lot of cover songs for their early albums and three out of eight tracks on 
<em>"Shades of Deep Purple"</em> are not written by the band. A bit of a shame really as all three cover 
songs drag the album down IMO. The cover of <B>The Beatles</B> track <em>"Help"</em> is especially 
awful. It borders blasphemy IMO. The original songs are much better and I have to mention 
<em>"Mandrake Root"</em> with it´s extented organ and guitar solo as the highlight of the album. A great track that one. The most 
adventurous moment on the album is the first two minutes of <em>"Prelude: happiness / I'm so glad"</em> 
which is a direct translation of the first movement of <em>"Scheherazade"</em> (<B>Nikolai Rimsky-
Korsakov</B>). Other than that the music is greatly influenced by hard rock artists like <B>Cream</B> and <B>Jimi 
Hendrix</B>. There´s also some psychadelic leanings.<p>The musicianship is pretty good and <B>Jon Lord´s</B> organ is already a dominant part of <B>Deep 
Purple´s</B> sound. <B>Ritchie Blackmore</B> shines a couple of times too. His trademark guitar 
sound is already in the making. There are not many memorable riffs though  (maybe except for the 
<B>Hendrix</B> like main riff in <em>"Mandrake Root"</em>).<p>The production is raw and I imagine that the album was recorded within a short time frame.<p><em>"Shades of Deep Purple"</em> is a pretty good but not wildly impressive debut album by  <B>Deep Purple</B> but I wish 
that they wouldn´t have included those cover tunes. An album full of original tunes would have 
earned them a 3 star rating but with the cover tracks I can only give the album a 2.5 star rating.

Since discussion of Deep Purple is inevitably very lineup-specific, that's a good place to 
start. The guitarist is one Ritchie Blackmore, who would eventually become one of the 
fastest, most intoxicating guitarists in the rock world, but for now hasn't grown too far past 
copped licks from Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix (though to be fair, he really did his 
homework well). The keyboardist is one Jon Lord, a solid (and eventually amazing) 
keyboardist whose one possible fatal flaw is a bit too much ambition - he apparently saw 
the band as a symphonic rock band, even if the other members didn't necessarily agree. 
On this album, this vision is limited to some lengthy pseudo-classical passages, while on 
the next couple of albums this vision would largely dominate the band's direction.<p>Ian Paice is behind the drums, and from the beginning proves to be the absolute perfect 
drummer for this group. Why is that, you may ask? It is because he has the technical skills 
and creativity to keep up with the rest of the group and follow the non-trivial rhythms that 
come with Blackmore and Lord solos, but also has the restraint to keep his drumming as 
the <em>support</em> of the band and to not attempt to dominate the sound (except, of course, 
for the occasional drum solo, sigh). In other words, none of this nonstop "Me Bonzo! Me 
see drum! Bonzo smash!" stuff that gets on my nerves with Led Zeppelin. But I digress. 
Rounding out the group are bassist Nick Simper, who is ok but largely indistinguishable, 
and Rod Evans, the lead singer, who sure does a good croon when the songs finally come 
around to vocal parts.<p>So what do all these parts add up to? They add up, in my opinion, to a band that's both 
quite impressive and quite average all at once. On the positive side, this band can play just 
fine - not only do the band members have solid technical skills, they sound and seem 
confident in their abilities to pull off their styles, not too creative amalgamations of other 
sources they may sometimes be, with a good understanding of what the hell it is they're 
doing, as well as with a nice amount of flair. On the minus side, both the originals and 
covers often feel a bit too much like exercises in style and technique; the originals sound 
like the band thought that having a song in a "poppy style" or "rock style" is enough, and the 
covers sound like the band just wanted to show off the cool things they could do with other 
people's tracks. This isn't to say the covers are necessarily <em>bad</em> exercises, of course -
 their cover of "Hush" by some guy named Joe South is freaking great, a nice upbeat pop 
song turned into a cross between a nice upbeat pop song and a trippy-as-hell anthem with 
all sorts of cool keyboard sounds and guitar wails and all those other things that make 
Purple Purple. Their cover of Cream's "I'm So Glad" is also quite enjoyable, even though it 
requires sitting through a lengthy Lord-driven introduction, which isn't awful but doesn't hold 
my attention long beyond a minute or so. The song itself kinda rules, though, if only 
because it's so faithful to the feel and vibe of the original, even though it doesn't sound like 
a carbon copy at all.<p>The other two covers are a little worse, though. "Help!," by John Lennon (of course), gets a 
pleasant-but-not-really-necessary intro and outro (consisting of the band slowly puttering 
on a quiet guitar theme), while the actual song is turned into a slooooooooow ballad 
climaxed by (of course) Jon and Ritchie each getting a chance at an anthemic solo. It's not 
bad, but six minutes is a bit much for such a thing, in my opinion. A bit much would be an 
understatement for the closing "Hey Joe," though, which starts off with a two-minute+ 
introduction that works off the rhythm of Ravel's Bolero (with all sorts of usual organ and 
guitar puttering - not that it's bad, just a bit aimless), before <em>finally</em> getting into the 
song, done at a slooooooow tempo as a soul ballad. Except for the parts that work off the 
themes of the introduction, of course. In other words, it takes 7:29 to get through 
freakin' "Hey Joe."<p>As for the originals, well, they're ok in their own way. "And the Address" is an alright opener, 
an instrumental that opens with a minute of organ effects before turning into acres of solos 
based around an occasional riff and subsequent groove. Fortunately, the riff is ok, and the 
solos are as entertaining as anything else on the record, so while this "song" is a bit too 
self-indulgent wanky, it's at least a decently done self-indulgent wanky. "Mandrake Root" is 
a straightup ripoff of "Foxey Lady," but a disturbingly enjoyable ripoff nontheless. And hey, 
the surf-rocker "Love Help Me" has some more great guitar wailing to go with the standard 
surf elements. On the other hand, "One More Rainy Day" is too sappy and flacid for my 
tastes, especially in the vocal parts, and definitely shows that the band didn't really know 
what it was doing in "conventional" songwriting.  Not yet, anyway.<p>For all that, I wouldn't want to give this less than a solid ***. For all the ripoffs and 
unrestrained soloing, there's nevertheless a great deal of enthusiasm coming out of this 
album, and competent enthusiasm at that, that's quite infectious to yours truly. They kinda 
remind me, at this point, of the very first incarnation of Yes that would come into being a 
year later, albeit with their songwriting skills a little less developed, and that can't help but 
make me smile. At least a bit. Don't go running out to get this, but if you've filled up on Mk. II 
and want more Purple, this is a good place to turn.</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong> 'Shades Of Deep Purple' - Deep Purple (6/10) </strong><p>The debut album from this massive hard rock band, Deep Purple's 'Shades Of Deep Purple' 
is met with some ambivalence. Setting aside the fact that this is an album without the 
band's best singer Ian Gillian, 'Shades Of Deep Purple' is often overlooked for the fact that it 
is composed greatly of cover songs rather than original material, although there are still a 
few songs here that the band wrote themselves. Taken for what it is, this debut is actually 
quite good, and really sets the stage for more successful music in the future.Surprisingly 
enough, the cover songs are the real draw to this album, but as the inventive rockers that 
they are, the covers are really made their own, taking 'Shades' from the forgettable album 
that many deem it to be, to a fairly interesting place in rock history.<p>While the bluesy 'Mandrake Root' will attract the most attention from Deep Purple fans (due 
to the fact that it has met a great deal of performances in live settings), I find myself most 
attracted to the covers that the band has done here. 'Hush' is a fairly well known single that 
got the band out there, and Deep Purple does it well; a memorable track with a catchy hook 
or two. The cover of the Beatles song 'Help!' is likely my favourite pick from the album 
though; it really shows what I mean about Deep Purple making these songs their own. 
While the original track was fairly upbeat and catchy, Deep Purple turns the song into a 
drawn out psychedelic experience. This is very refreshing to hear, especially from an album 
that is almost half a century old by this point.<p>The band was certainly heavier than most at the time, but they still have ample loads of 
British pop in their sound, especially when it comes to the vocals. Although not as good as 
Gillian, Rod Evans does a good job of fronting the band.<p>'Shades Of Deep Purple' is a nice start for this band, and while the abundance of covers is 
certainly controversial, I really think that Deep PUrple goes beyond reprising the hits of the 
day and makes these classic tracks  into something new oand original, sometimes almost 
to the point where they could be considered originals unto themselves. There is nothing 
particularly excellent here and Deep Purple would certainly go on to much better things, but 
this should be an interesting experience for anyone wanting a nice piece of hard rock from 
the late 60's.</strong></strong></em></em>

Before morphing into the hugely-successful proto-metal outfit that produced such hard-rockin' classics as 'In 
Rock', 'Machine Head' and 'Burn', Deep Purple were very much a group whose early sonic style was rooted in 
both the short-lived psychedelic phenomenon of the late-sixties and the emerging progressive rock scene of 
the early-seventies. Largely ignored in their homeland during these formative years, the group - at this time 
featuring the MK 1 line-up of Rod Evans(vocals), Jon Lord(organ), Ritchie Blackmore(guitar), Nick 
Simper(bass) and Ian Paice(drums) - would nevertheless manage to strike commercial gold throughout the 
USA thanks to the shrewdly-picked single 'Hush'(latterly covered by psych-pop outfit Kula Shakur during the 
mid-nineties Brit-pop boom). 'Hush' reached no.4 on the US BIllboard charts, yet despite this surprise success 
the UK proved a much harder nut to crack, and it would be several more years before Deep Purple became a 
name-brand in their own country. However, the USA was different. Thanks to 'Hush', the group's resultant 
debut album 'Shades Of Deep Purple' would also prove popular, thus laying the foundations for a four-decade 
long career that has seen the name Deep Purple become synonymous with both hard rock and heavy metal, 
the group in the process becoming one of the most successful and famous of all British rock bands. But what 
of their debut? A flowery, organ-soaked albeit hard-edged slice of rough 'n' ready psych-tinged rock, 'Shades Of 
Deep Purple' is indeed a curiosity, though at the same time and despite the stylistic differences from their later, 
better known material, this is still unmistakeably Deep Purple. The upbeat and catchy 'Hush' apart, 'Shades Of 
Deep Purple' is a genuine mixed bag of covers and original material, organist Jon Lord the dominant force 
throughout. The group's slightly anaemic cover of 'Hey Joe' suffers from poor quality production, a factor which 
hampers much of the album, whilst 'Help' - which was released as a single in the UK to little fanfare - also fails 
to set the pulse racing despite a ballsy display from original vocalist Rod Evans. However, despite the slightly 
uninspired nature of these tracks, the superior original material does provide occasional nuggets, with the 
Ritchie Blackmore-penned 'Mandrake Root'(the name of the guitarist's previous group) showing off some 
impressive organ-guitar interplay. Very much an album caught between several stylistic stools, 'Shades Of 
Deep Purple' is a fascinating glimpse of group caught in their embryonic stage of development. The mixture of 
hard-rock riffs, jazzy organs and lucid psych-pop may well turn fans of the group's classic sound away, though 
this is much more than just a dated curiosity. The weak covers  - and 'Hush' - aside, Deep Purple's debut is a 
solid slice of hard-edged psychedelia for those who find The Beatles just a little bit too soft.<p>STEFAN TURNER, STOKE NEWINGTON, 2012</strong></strong></em></em>

More rooted in hard-edged psychedelia than the early metal they would eventually be known 
for, Deep Purple's debut album finds the band relying heavily on their highly distinctive 
arrangements of various 1960s counterculture standards. Some of these are more successful 
than others; they give a decent rendition of the slow version of Hey Joe (but few bands worth 
their salt back then couldn't pull off a Hey Joe if they had a mind to), whilst their version of the 
Beatles' Help feels a little heavy-handed and pompous, the stridency of the band striking an 
incongruous note next to the fragility of the lyrics. Still, their take on Hush is downright excellent.</strong></strong></em></em>

A rather primitive and uncharacteristic album from what Deep Purple became famous for. They relied
heavily on covers and the music in general is not very different from much of what was coming out of
bands at the time. However, there are plenty of moments hinting the potential they had from the get
go: Jon Lord´s powerful Hammond runs were up to any other virtuoso keyboardist of the day (Keith
Emerson included) and Ian Paice drumming is simply terrific, showing a rare very unique musical
personality so early on. Only Blakmore´s guitar playing is a little green compared to what he´d do
very soon, but it is very fine and tasteful even at that stage. I also liked Nick Simper bass runs.
Rod Evans is a good singer, ok. <p>Of the tracks, most are tentative although again their virtuosity was already showing, as the
instrumental opener And The Address clearly makes this statement. Hush is a classic and is a nice
rock tune, very well connected with the time and still standing well after all these years. Some
arrangements are a bit too pompous and a bit pointless, like in their cover of the Beatles Help.
Others are too typical 60´s pop (One More Rainy Day). Still, their energy and talent are visible and
as a first efford, quite strong. <p>Deep Purple would easily surpass this CD in a very short time - Book Of Talesyn, incredibly recorded
just a few months after this is a great leap forward - but I found it quite interesting and more
than just a curio for fans and collectors. They were always special. <p>Rating: between 2.5 and 3 stars. </strong></strong></em></em>

The first song that I listened from this album was "Prelude: Happiness / I`m So Glad" in 1969-70. It 
was released in my country as a single (divided in two parts, with the Side One of that single having 
at the end a fade-out at the start of the guitar solo, and at the start of  the Side Two a fade-in at  the 
other parts of the same guitar solo). My father bought it. Maybe he listened to this song in the radio 
some day and he liked it.<p>This album was recorded with a low budget, and this  can be  listened in it, really. It was recorded in 
a three day period in May 1968. The recording is not very good, and it sounds like it was mostly 
recorded live in the studio, with very few overdubs. There are some sound effects used  between 
each song which were used as "links". They gave to this album a psychedelic sound. But this album 
really has some different musical styles: Hard Rock, Psychedelia, Pop Rock, Progressive Rock. The 
band sounds really very at the start of  their recording career, but it sounds very well, Still, there are 
some mellow arrangments and songs, like "One More Rainy Day" and "Help" (this last one is a song 
from THE BEATLES). There are also some Prog Rock influences with the use of some Classical 
Music parts in "Prelude: Happiness / I`m So Glad" (using a part from "Scheherazade" by Rimsky-
Korsakov) and in "Hey Joe" (with some parts with music by Manuel de Falla).  Hard Rock can be 
listened in "And the Address" , "Mandrake Root" and "Love Help Me". Pop Rock can be listened in 
"Hush", "One more rainy day" and "Help". Drummer Ian Paice and keyboard player Jon Lord both 
shine in playing their instruments. Ritchie Blackmore plays well too but his guitar playing style was 
still not very clear for DEEP PURPLE and his guitar parts  were not very  well recorded and mixed. 
Lead singer Rod Evans had a voice maybe more  oriented to Pop Rock and Ballads than to Hard 
Rock, and bassist Nick Simper plays well. There are some backing vocals by Lord and Simper which 
sound more oriented to Pop Rock too. Anyway, as a whole, this is a good album, with four original 
songs ("And the address", "One more rainy day",  "Mandrake root"  and "Love help me") and four 
covers ("Hush	", "Prelude: happiness / I'm so glad",  "Help"	and  "Hey Joe"). <p>I think that this album and YES`self-titled album have some things in common: both had a 
combination of original songs and some covers; both albums still sound very "sixties"  in musical style 
and influences; both were not recorded with big budgets; and both show very good bands with very 
good debut albums. Maybe YES` first album sounds better, but both albums are very energetic. 
Maybe both sound a bit dated now, but still are  enjoyable.</strong></strong></em></em>

What strange beginnings for one of the three unholy trinity bands that together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath would 
introduce the world to a new universe of music in the forms of hard rock and heavy metal. Despite their contributions they started 
out much like The Monkees in formation, meaning that members were recruited by Chris Curtis who had visions of creating a 
supergroup called Roundabout which was to have a rotating cast of musical members. He approached the business tycoon Tony 
Edwards for funding and the first members he managed to woo into the project were none other than keyboardist Jon Lord and 
guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. Also fulfilling what is now referred to as the Mark I era of DEEP PURPLE, were Nick Simper on bass, Ian 
Paice on drums and original vocalist Rod Evans who was definitely no Ian Gillan but did suit the 60s psychedelic leanings of the 
sound the band were engaging in at this stage.<p>This album starts off with the groovy instrumental "And This Address" which gives me flashes of partying with Austin Powers in 
somewhere 60s London which also has slight references to the following track and single "Hush." This single is one of those songs i 
never dug too much but i have to admit it's played very well and the instrumental exchanges are fairly complex for psychedelic 
music of this era. It's not really as bad as i've always made it out to be. I have to admit that i've had a change of heart on this debut 
album. I used to despise early DEEP PURPLE but as i've grown more fond of 60s heavy psych and the sound that surrounds it, i have 
gained an appreciation for album number one of one of hard rock's most famous offerings. While there are still many things i dislike 
about this one in comparison to later releases, there is still a lot to like here. This is 60s psychedelic rock through and through and 
on this one Jon Lord is the star with his classically infused keyboard runs and i can only admit that this music is played 
extraordinarily well and quite sophisticated for this era in rock history. The musicians gel together beautifully. Nick Simper's bass 
playing is surely a major factor as he displays a passionate energy that seemingly holds the whole thing together. Surprisingly 
Blackmore's guitar contributions are quite subdued. <p>The reasons this album fails to blow me away are manyfold. Firstly, i'm not a huge fan of Rod Evans vocals. Although he gets the job 
done in tune and all he still fails to be a charismatic lead vocalist and is no Jim Morrison or, you guessed it - Ian Gillan. Secondly, i'm 
not a huge fan of cover songs unless the band can take the bull by the horns and lead it to strawberry fields forever. While i admire 
their attempt on this one to conquer huge hits by The Beatles ("Help") and Jimi Hendrix ("Hey Joe") and i quite love the instrumental 
embellishments, i simply feel these tracks derail the momentum of the album as a whole. Thirdly, while the musical equation of the 
album is fairly well done, the lyrical contributions have some serious lameness at times. Perfect example is the instrumentally 
competent "Prelude: " which delivers "Happiness" in the beginning but once it gets to "I'm So Glad" and repeats that phrase ad 
infinitum, it makes me want to gag myself with a pitchfork and orally excrete my stomacal contents. In the end this is too much of a 
mixed bag and the bad makes me enjoy the good less than others seem to. For all the positive elements on this debut release, i'd 
rather just fast forward to the Mark II phase and be issue free.

The story of Deep Purple begins with the name of a musician that you won't see on any of Deep Purple's album line-ups.  That 
person was Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band 'The Searchers'.  The British taste in rock music was changing, and 
the beat bands were dying out, so Curtis had plans to start a new band that followed along with those changes, something 
that would be similar to The Nice or The Moody Blues.  Something psychedelic, like Jimi Hendrix or Cream, yet experimental 
like Pink Floyd and something accessible like The Rolling Stones.  Curtis' idea was to be the lead singer to a revolving bunch of 
band members who would step off and on the stage while he remained the only constant.  The band was to be 
called 'Roundabout'.<p>Early on, Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore were recruited to be in this new band.  It was soon found that Curtis was going to be 
too authoritative, and was asked to leave the band, however, Lord and Blackmore enjoyed working together so they 
continued to recruit members.  Nick Simper was soon recruited as bass player.  Ian Gillian was also asked to joint, but 
declined.  Rod Stewart was considered but was felt that he wasn't up to standard.  However, Rod Evans did make the cut and 
left his club band 'The Maze' and brought along Ian Paice as drummer who replaced the original choice.  The band didn't 
change their name until after some demos were recorded.  Just before their first gig, Blackmore suggested naming the band 
after his grandmothers favorite song, and the name 'Deep Purple' stuck.  The five original members (later known as the Mk. 1 
lineup) started working on their first album, rehearsing for 2 months and recording it in 3 days.  The album has 4 original 
tracks and 4 covers.  The decision to do so many covers was because none of them at the time were accomplished song 
writers and to also try to follow in the footsteps of 'Vanilla Fudge' in making extra long versions of famous covers.  <p>'And the Address', one of the original songs on the album, is the opening track and is also the first written by the band.  It 
starts things off with an instrumental, opening with what would become the familiar psychedelic organ and guitar power 
chord sound.  The sound is a bit rough and unpolished compared to what it would in later years.  The song has the blues-y 
sound of Cream, but sounded more like beginners at the time.  This is followed by the first cover on the album 'Hush', which 
would also be the first single.  Those unfamiliar with Deep Purple's earlier sound will notice the mostly unremarkable voice of 
Ron Evans, not that he was bad, he just didn't stand out much.  The killer organ sound would stand out, however, and would 
be the thing that would push the band's signature sound even more in subsequent albums.  The single would turn out to be a 
hit for the band and it got their name out to the UK public.  The B-side of that single is the next track on the album; 'One More 
Rainy Day'.  This one was written by Lord and Evans and was the last track to be recorded for the album.  It sounds more like 
an accessible song, very pop-oriented and also underwhelming.  The first side ends with a longer track 'Prelude: 
Happiness/I'm So Glad' which is partially written by the band and partially a cover of a Skip James song.  The first half, which is 
credited to the entire band, actually uses parts from the classical composition 'Scheherezade' by Rimsky-Korsakov before 
moving into a poppy version of James' delta blues song, which was also covered by 'Cream'.  It does have a few extended 
instrumental sections, but they sound like a beginner band.<p>The 2nd side opens with an original track called 'Mandrake Root' which was originally an instrumental.  Lyrics were added at 
the last minute because the band didn't want more than one instrumental on the album.  The song has a more blues inspired 
sound more like the first track on the album.  Incidentally, both tracks were recorded at the same time.  The instrumental 
break features fast and furious drums and a boiling organ solo with a heavy and psychedelic guitar solo following later.  The 
cover of The Beatles 'Help!' follows.  This is a much slower version than the original and given the psychedelic treatment very 
similar to that of 'Vanilla Fudge'.  This was apparently the track that landed Deep Purple a recording contract.  It is actually a 
beautiful rendition of the song, but it also leans more towards a pop sound with instrumental break becoming a bit more 
intense.  'Love Help Me' is an original track written by Blackmore and Evans, but is mostly underwhelming.  The final track on 
the original version was another cover, this time of 'Hey Joe', which had been made famous by Jimi Hendrix.  Deep Purple's 
version starts it off with a 'Bolero' style, long introduction before it kind of clumsily slips into the familiar song.  It's a decent 
enough version at least for a new band, but with the attempt to bring in the Spanish feel ends up making it sound a bit 
choppy and messy.<p>The Remastered CD edition of the album includes an outtake, an original song called 'Shadows' which was left off the album.  
It sounds more like on of their more accessible tracks, a bit too poppy and one that was definitely better left off the album.  
There is an instrumental version of 'Love Help Me' which is still just as underwhelming as the album version.  Then there is an 
alternate take of 'Help!' which isn't much different from the album version, probably less interesting if anything.  A BBC Top 
Gear Session version of 'Hey Joe' takes out the Spanish dance sections at the beginning and end and actually presents a more 
concise and 'cleaner' version.  The last bonus track is a live US TV performance of 'Hush'<p>So, this ends up being a not very consistent album for a band that would soon enough establish themselves as one of the best 
hard rock bands eventually.  But this album pretty much remains entertaining mostly for the historical value than anything 
else.  The fact that the album had to be recorded so quickly makes it feel like a rush job.  After this album, the band would 
move to a more jam and experimental band, focusing more on the psychedelic sound that would carry them through their 
first years.  As far as this album, it is fairly underwhelming and definitely has very little to offer as far as progressive music is 
concerned, but it still ends up being a decent hard rock effort by what was then a fledgling band who never though they 
would be around as long as they now have been.<p><p>

A not so humble beginning for one of the three hard rock/proto-metal holy bands; Deep Purple started paving the road of their glorious history with an album heavily influenced by Vanilla Fudge, presenting to the world a mixture of psychedelic rock, heavy rock, tints of prog, and ephemeral moments of pop music; a joyous collection of songs, and an overall impression that this band is in for something special - that is how 'Shades of Deep Purple' makes me feel every time I play it.<p>The earliest incarnation of the band is surely not as iconic as the one that reigned the world from 1970 onwards, but is no less important, as this album set a very specific flavor to the band - one of great energy, vitality, and joy. The first three Purple albums all share the same asset that was later touched upon less - they are all quite accessible; whether one owes this fact to the more generic vocals of Rod Evans, as opposed to Gillan's banshee screaming, or to the lighthearted nature of the songs.<p>However, this record is a very good example of the popular music in Britain back in '68 and also a very important first step for the group.<p>A mixture of original compositions and cover songs (in the fashion of Vanilla Fudge, 'their heroes', as Ritchie Blackmore would refer to them), the albums has eight tracks and a length of 42 minutes.<p>Side one opens with the instrumental 'And the Address', a fast-paced and catchy song with a great Jon Lord riff, backed up perfectly by Blackmore. Interestingly (and surprisingly), the band revisited the song on 'Whoosh', creating something like a full circle; curious stuff! This is followed by their first big hit 'Hush', a poppier psychedelic single that has been in my opinion overplayed by radio stations. 'One More Rainy Day' is a good example of the lighthearted nature of the Mark I line-up's music that I already mentioned, and 'I'm so glad' is a well-executed cover on which Blackmore's bluesy side shines.<p>Side two opens with another very recognizable piece of music from Purple, 'Mandrake Root', a proto-heavy metal track covered in psychedelic drapery, followed by a Beatles cover of 'Help!'. 'Love Help Me' is just fine and 'Hey Joe' is a powerful closing track with silly lyrics.<p>The most experienced musician from the quintet at that time was Jon Lord, something that anyone could tell just by listening to the eight songs on this debut LP but Blackmore and Paice were surely the two 'diamonds in the rough'. 'Shades of Deep Purple' is a very good album, and a recommendation for anyone who wonders what hard rock and prog looked like in embryo.

The iconic band's debut album. The question being asked here is: Can a record label mold a group of musicians with 
very heavy inclinations into a radio-friendly pop band?<p>1. "And the Address" (4:38) an instrumental jam in which the band shows off its musicianship and stylistic preferences, 
here within a heavy rock chord progression. The sound engineering (recording clarity) is weak yet the instruments can 
be heard and distinguished. There is definitely something in the way the musicians play (and add subtle flourishes 
here and there) that makes me think of full-blown 1970s prog. (8.875/10)<p>2. "Hush" (4:24) the band's first hit has a familiar 1960s feel to it with an Elvis-like vocal performance with its renowned 
"nah, nah-nah nah" line. The musicians' tightness is notable: they're all so tightly in the pocket. (9.125/10)<p>3. "One More Rainy Day" (3:40) multi-tracked lead vocals and b vox during the choruses gives this rather simple song a 
very pop orientation. At the same time, each of the instrumentalists is adding their own fill nuances, convincing me 
that they are really skilled musicians. (8.875/10)<p>4. "Prelude: Happiness / I'm So Glad" (7:19) a fairly simple and almost-monotonous song (especially, but only, the 
lyrics/vocals) on which the band try to produce something anthemic. (13/15)<p>5. "Mandrake Root" (6:09) an HENDRIX-style sound and structure gives the band members ample opportunity to show 
that they have chops--especially Ian Paice. (9.33333/10)<p>6. "Help" (6:01) here the band displays more of their independent vision with a totally unique take on The Beatles 
classic hit--sounding as if they're playing in the sacristy of an Aquarian Age church. (8.75/10)<p>7. "Love Help Me" (3:49) the band (or producers/record company) trying to fit a heavy rock band into a contemporary 
pop song. Sorry, but the band's proclivity for heavy slash-and-burn outweighs any sunny pop intentions. (8.75/10)<p>8. "Hey Joe" (7:33) opening with a motif that is very much like Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit," we get an extended 
instrumental intro (almost two-and-a-half minutes with some very nice organ soloing from Jon Lord) before there is a 
sudden transition into the classic Hendrix version of "Hey Joe" at 2:25. Rod Evans vocal performance here is my 
favorite on the album and the others do a remarkable job of taking The Experience's masterful version even further. 
(14/15)<p>Total Time 43:33<p>Despite relying on covers and imitation, Deep Purple proves that they have chops and they have vision.<p>B+/4.5 stars; a near-masterpiece in which some highly-creative and -skilled musicians try to conform to the 
expectation of fitting their expansive vision and style into the clothing of some very simple rock compositions. The 
band shows that it can work but that they really need different clothes--ones of their own design and imagination.

Deep Purple were a band that changed. A lot. In just two years they went from a psychedelic rock band to a much harder, heavier sound.

Certainly not the best album in the back catalogue of DP, but it has its charms. It is also interesting to 
watch - or hear - five individuals, who did not know each other that quite well at the time of recording, to 
try to become a band and invent some music and to imprint their own style on the

Not listened to this before today. I'd missed it on the Deep Purple 'must listen to' list. Its there
now and though deemed Proto-Prog its sits in that shadowy genre wheref Psychodelic and Progressive
meet (think debut Jefferson Airplane and Arzachel). Though Deep Purple followed the hard rock,

Back in the late 60s Deep Purple were a typical but above average band for that era. These early albums haven't aged very
well what with the passé hairdos, Evans' voice (eerily similar to Neil Diamond) and the simple pop-rock structures (albeit
slightly enhanced by Jon Lord's classically-inspired

I like this album very much. It's full of covers, but who cares. Great version of I'm
So Glad, Help, Hush and Hey Joe. The best DP line up in my opinion. Psychedelic, hard

This historic Purple debut was mainly a cool 60s pop album - which is exactly what the 
formative band intended it to be. Shades did not make much of an impression in their home 
country of England, but it was wildly popular here in the states. Probably because the 
vocal harmonies on the short s

This is great album, and very progressive! Just listen to "Hey Joe" and wonderful organ 
solo in spanish manner. "Mandrake Root" is another song that will drive you mad. Pay 
attention to rythym and virtuosity of all instruments! In summary, SODP is very 
underrated album, and bigger shame is tha

     ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED ALBUMS I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY SHORT LIFE

REALLY: 3,06

With this album the Deep Purple entered in the world of the music business. And there 
they entered enough well. I should say that Simper and Evans are the weak ring of the 
Purple MkI. To the same time I should say that "And The Address", "Hush", "One More

Deep Purple was great! This, their first, is somewhat good. I was first introduced to
this record on the compilation "Purple Passages", (as I bet many were). I really
wasn't aware of the chronology until revisiting this album. "Mandrake Root", "And the
Address", and "Hush" are top-shelf, but unfo
