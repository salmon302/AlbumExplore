<strong>Os Mundi biography</strong><br />
OS MUNDI was located in Berlin. Two forerunners are to point out, the first named SAFEBREAKERS covered TOP 40 songs and later on ORANGE SURPRISE with own material and also producing film music. Four musicians started in 1970 with the new band name: Udo Arndt (guitar, vocals), Christoph Busse (drums, vocals), Dietrich Markgraf (flute, sax) and Andreas Villain (bass). Their first album 'Latin Mass' was produced for the Metronome label. OS MUNDI tried to convert a catholic mass into Psychedelic/Heavy Rock provided with a dark atmosphere and a rough production. Above all the latin lyrics are characteristic and unique.<br><br>Wolfgang "Buddy" Mandler (drums, percussion) and Raimund "Mikro" Rilling (cello, bass) later joined the band to produce the second effort '43 Minuten' followed by female Jazz and Pop vocalist Ute Kannenberg. Influences of the new members are well recognizable. Their next album from 1972 is differing to the forerunner prefering more Symphonic and Jazz Rock elements whereas the song 'A Question Of Decision" is known to be the masterpiece.<br><br>The band failed producing new albums afterwards but existed until 1975 involving more and more musicians. So OS MUNDI can be considered as one of the first rock big-bands with more than 10 members at once. From 1975 on to 1980 the band gave one sold out revival concert a year at the famous Berlin 'Quartier Latin'. This performances were appointed with a strong Jazz Rock orientation.<br><br>Some recordings of the band's late phase are taken for a 2004 production named 'Os Mundi'. Finally in 2007 the compilation 'Sturmflut' featuring Harald Skorepa (keyboards) was released by Schneeball Production. This album contains a live track including the follower Free Jazz band OHPSST.<br><br>Many of the former band members are still working in the music business.<br><br>Rivertree (Uwe Zickel)<br><br><br>OS MUNDI members and guest musicians:<br>Udo Arndt (guitar, vocals)<br>Christoph Busse (drums, vocals)<br>Dietrich Markgraf (flute, saxophone)<br>Andreas Villain (bass)<br>Wolfgang "Buddy" Mandler (drums, percussion)<br>Raimund "Mikro" Rilling (cello, bass)<br>Ute Kannenberg (vocals)<br>Ludolf Kuchenbuch (saxophone)<br>Klaus Henrichs (saxophone)<br>Bernhard Arndt (piano)<br>Michael "Fame" Günther (bass)<br>Wolfram Jacob (percussion)<br>Harald Skorepa (piano, synthesizer, organ)<br>Konstantin "Bommi" Bommarius (drums)<br>Peter Autschbach (guitar)<br><br><br>

<img src="static-images/5stars.gif" alt="5 stars" border="0">
Formed in Berlin in 1970, OS MUNDI was one of the early progressive German bands that was more inspired by American 60s bands than the exploding Krautrock scene of its native homeland. OS MUNDI developed out of the previous band Safebreakers that existed from 1962-66 but was inspired by the German music scene when sharing a rehearsal room with other musicians from the Kraut world. Jam sessions with Manuel G'ttsching and other Krautsters added the sense of musical adventurism and the band evolved its music considerably. This band was also notable for having up to a dozen musicians at a time which earned it the title 'big band of rock music.'<p>OS MUNDI only released two albums during its initial run and each quite different from the other. LATIN MASS came out immediately in 1970 and stood out like a sore thumb in the early German progressive scene with an eclectic mix of styles and sounds that although rooted in the psychedelic 60s, took on the adventurous nature of the Krautrock scene without really sounding like any of the bands that were in the forefront of its nascency. Primarily inspired by The Electric Prunes' 1968 psychedelic album 'Mass in F Minor' which mixed the heavy psych 60s with traditional Christian liturgical music, OS MUNDI went one step further and sung all lyrics in Latin. The results were quite unusual however extremely well played. One could consider this as taking The Electric Prunes idea and shooting it up with steroids.<p>Immediately with the opening 'Overture' OS MUNDI gifts the listener with a 60s psychedelic grooviness drenched in freaked out organs that aren't afraid to jump into the mosh pit as far as bringing the instrument and the 60s style to its logical conclusions such was the case with many bands in the transitional year of 1970 that sort of exited right in the middle of the the latter part of the 60s and the prog scene that was blossoming at light speed. While a psychedelic rendition of church music may not sound like a winning combination, the beauty of LATIN MASS is that the liturgy aspects only remain a small element like a canvass to paint upon whereas the psychedelic, prog and Krautrock elements boldly craft a beautiful array of adventures twists and turns that make this album a treat from beginning to end. <p>The album sort of has a continuous flow that wends and winds from spastic organ bombast to heavy blues rock guitar. Much of the album is nothing more than adventurous jamming but even though a bass driven groove keeps the melodic flow humming along, the contrapuntal Latin lyrics offer a dramatic and often theatrical dominant aspect. The musical grooves are also quite creative in how they change things up with bizarre bass runs and guitar licks. The music offers outbursts into tribal drum circles as well as adding touches of jazzy outbursts before jumping back into heavy organ trippiness. Even atonality and avant-garde freeform avant-prog is explored towards the end of the album after the album has seeped into your very soul.<p>LATIN MASS was an unbelievably creative album for 1970 with an incessant array of fresh ideas delivered with a fiery passion. The lyrics in the Latin language keep it from sounding like anything remotely German and although the influences are clearly from the American music scene of the 1960s, OS MUNDI successfully eschewed that stilted too late to the game stylistic approach that many trapped in the past were still dishing out. This is what i call the perfect bridge between one era morphing into the next. All the tracks on this one stand out and the tightrope act of accessible melodic grooves with avant-garde adventurism is impeccable. For my tastes, this album is pretty much perfect in how its executed and stands out as one of the most unique of the early prog years. Despite all the creative mojo going on here, it's the variety of organ sounds that make this one an outstanding slice of early psych fueled prog. </strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/4stars.gif" alt="4 stars" border="0">
This is OS MUNDI's ambitious debut released in 1970 where they sought to convert a Catholic Mass into a dark and 
heavy psychedelic work with rough production. And don't forget the Latin lyrics, and I like that the vocalist has some 
character to his voice. It took a few spins but this is an excellent Krautrock record but I still prefer the more jazzy 
second album "43 Minuten". Besides the usual instruments we also get flute, sax, bongos and cello. The sax and cello 
seems to get buried in the sound but I'm not complaining.<p>"Ouverture" hits the ground running with the organ out front. Great sound here when it settles into a groove. A calm 1 
1/2 minutes in then some guitar expressions come and go. Nice. I like the way this unfolds and changes yet keeps the 
same vibe. A dark mood arrives after 3 minutes then back to a brighter mood with guitar after 3 1/2 minutes. It blends 
into "Kyrie" where vocals join in quickly. This is really good. The vocals are manipulated at times as it becomes 
experimental. Organ, a beat and more as we get this fairly pleasant sound before 2 minutes.<p>"Gloria" opens with organ as a beat joins in and more as it builds to a full sound. Vocals too. It settles back around 2 
minutes but not for long as it picks back up. A rumbling drum solo after 3 minutes goes on to the end. A bit much. 
"Credo" is a top three tune and my favourite. A full sound hits us right away with vocals. Catchy stuff with some killer 
bass lines and organ runs. It turns experimental after a minute and then starts to self-destruct as it were with 
discordant piano and more. Then this amazing organ melody with bass and drums kicks in. So good! Vocals join in. 
Amazing sound here. Classic krautrock right here people! Check out the guitar 5 1/2 minutes in as he starts to solo. So 
much going besides this though. Just a great track.<p>"Credo II" is a top three and we get some grungy sounding guitar with organ, bass, drums then vocals. It lightens 2 1/2 
minutes as the vocals also settle down. I like this. Back to the previous theme before 3 1/2 minutes. "Sanctus" is my 
final top three song and the longest at over 9 minutes. A vocal statement as it were before the guitar starts to solo 
with organ, bass and more. A calm with vocals a minute in. A relaxed guitar solo 2 minutes in after the vocals step 
aside. The flute replaces the guitar 3 1/2 minutes in. Sounds like they are improvising a minute later. It settles back as 
sounds come and go to the end. Interesting stuff. <p>The previous song blends into "Agnus Dei" where the arrival of the pounding drums signals a change. We get FLOYD-
like vocals that pretty much shout the lyrics briefly then we get an almost dead calm. Distorted and insane guitar 
follows. Vocals are back then it kicks into gear. The organ stands out here and I like how themes are repeated. The 
guitar is crying out late.<p>My cd is a re-issue from 2004 on Mason Records but the liner notes are in German unfortunately. Even the pictures 
inside disappoint because they are so tiny. Great album though.</strong></strong></em></em>

Heading for a second album, guitarist Udo Arndt apparently had explored the dynamics of Jazz and the rise of Fusion within the German borders and decided that his band should also move to that direction.For this reason the four-man line-up of Os Mundi was expanded to a sextet with the addition of Buddy Mandler on bongos, congas, bell and drums and Mikro Rilling on percussion and cello.The band was signed by the Brain label and the album ''43 minuten'' came out in 1972.Renowned producer Conny Planck also plays the guitar on this effort.<p>From the more Kraut Psych-styled debut now the band was sounding more like a typical Kraut Fusion group, although they never really quit on writing long, psychedelic instrumental moves with hypnotic edges, smooth grooves and the flute in evidence.In fact ''43 minuten'' sounds pretty balanced between the previous album and the new trend, which finds the group with a sax-dominated style, full of jazzy solos and light improvisations.THIRSTY MOON, KRAAN and PASSPORT are the best comparisons.The guys surely knew how to rock their fans at moments with these superb guitar leads and solos and continuous, metronomic Kraut-flavored rhythms, but they were doing it by throwing in a good dose of Jazz with the sweet sax moves and the slight Ethnic colors, as performed on the various percussions.Their music was very powerful and passionate with occasional organ injections and a heavy amount of changing climates, from doomy and dark deliveries to fiery rhythmic tunes.The addition of jazzy elements made their arrangements quite complex and you should be 100% there to fully appreciate their unclassifiable music.The three semi-long pieces at the end of the album are stunning, full of dramatic atmospheres, irritating guitars and isolated solo executions, a good example of how close Kraut Rock and Jazz were stylistically speaking.<p>Os Mundi existed with some brief pauses until 1980, but no official albums were actually issued after ''43 minuten''.''Sturmflut'' is a 2007 archival album, released on Garden of Delights and featuring material recorded by the band with different line-ups between 1973-75, this should be a good purchase for fans of the band and the style.<p>Very good jazzy Kraut Rock.Intense, psychedelic and dynamic with great instrumental variety and tempo variations.Strongly recommended...3.5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

Not typical Krautrock but they definitely have something flavoured like desert or dry fruits, as we
can hear via Krautrock.<p>Very theatrical, dramatic, and enthusiastic "Mass". We cannot always feel such a passion via
Krautrock basically (understood that they belong to Eclectic subgenre rather than Krautrock). On the
other hand, they launch psychedelic organ-based fuzzy muddy colours in front of them, that can be
felt in lots of 60s- or 70s-oldie-goodie psychedelic pop / rock / progressive rock with symphonic
spice. Credo suite leans toward this colourful atmosphere, strongly.<p>Anyway, let me say they can be more appreciated as a psychedelic-flavoured, non-electronic, slightly
improvised Krautrock unit, like Eiliff. Their improvisation can be heard in "Sanctus" (especially in
the latter part featuring bizarre flute dances and explosive percussion)  ... in the same vein like
"Eve Of Eternity". Cannot avoid saying they'd played fascinating Krautrock really.<p>I'm so pleased they got appreciated as an Eclectic progressive rock outfit, as honestly I say.
Please listen to the former part (or Side A) of this album, and feel how versatile their playing is,
through their dramatic theatrical Musical progression, which make us immersed in Os Mundic world. So
happy if you enjoy this creation as a versatile, dramatic Krautrock one. Fantastic indeed.</strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/4stars.gif" alt="4 stars" border="0">
Having been brought up a good 'kafflick' boy during the 1960s I can just about remember 
the Latin Mass, or Tridentine Mass to give it its proper name. Since the Second Vatican 
Council (1962-65), and as part of an attempt to modernise, the use of Latin has been 
restricted and the Church has called for Mass be said in the vernacular. Funnily enough the 
old service is nowadays enjoying a revival, something that progressives in the modern 
Church actually see as a backward step.  <p>One other irony of the Latin Mass is that the priest conducts the liturgy facing east and, back 
in the day, it was to the east that many young Catholics looked in their search for spiritual 
guidance as they deserted the Church in favour of Hinduism and Buddhism. And of course 
many of Os Mundi's contemporaries performed eastern-inspired music. So, what 
prompted this album? What drove Os Mundi to record a Latin Mass in 1970 using the rock 
idiom? Were they mocking the Church or were they advocating the coexistence of faith and 
rock? <p>Well my money's on the musical joke angle, with the Church as the butt of the humour, 
because Os Mundi raise merry hell with this raw, rag-tag work. That may at once be the 
album's main pro and con however, since the appeal of the Tridentine Mass, not only to 
traditionalist Catholics but also to atheists like Carl Jung, was its mysticism. But Os Mundi 
have replaced the extraordinary spiritual power of the Latin Mass with the dark explosive 
power of trash-psychedelia. The pace seldom slackens from the very first demonic bars 
of 'Ouverture', and although this track is an instrumental the Hammond organ carries with it 
images of bleeding statues and the fiery breath of satirical blasphemy rather than the call 
for spiritual growth.  <p>It's as if the bonds of Catholic convention have been blasted and torn asunder by an icy 
Teutonic wind, a wind that has also resulted in a 180-degree turnaround by moving from an 
intensely Christian to a dynamic pagan ethic. The wild fervour of the 'Kyrie' mantra together 
with the excitable tribal drums and rabble of voices on the 'Gloria' have an organic unity that 
is both primitive and earthbound. And the two-part 'Credo' is like a descent into the bowels 
of Hell on the wings of Death, the return journey propelled by the glorious golden sunburst 
of a billion candlelights. <p>The 'Sanctus' precedes the consecration of the Host, the most solemn part of the liturgy 
where the priest is believed to perform the miracle of transubstantiation and Os Mundi 
represent this with the free association of a flute freakout. The album then draws to a rather 
non-dramatic conclusion as the 'Agnus Dei' just melts away quickly and meaninglessly.<p>Four-and-a-half centuries after Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the Castle 
Church wall at Wittenberg the Catholic Church recognised the importance of active 
participation by the congregation through the use of local languages, and it took until more 
recently for the Catholic laity to finally be allowed to receive the Eucharist, Hussite-fashion, 
in both kinds. This album isn't without its drawbacks either, in particular the shabby 
production, but while it may not do anything for the faith it's sure to gain more than a few 
converts for Os Mundi.

Disclaimer: First of all- If you haven't already, then you NEED TO HEAR THIS ALBUM ON VINYL. It is the best way to hear this type of music. CD's (and YouTube, especially) do not do it proper justice. Music-Lovers; there is no excuse, not even the moderately higher price, to justify not listening to this music the way it sounds best. An inexpensive turntable and vinyl reissue will blow you away. Trust me.<p>
Os Mundi came from Berlin, and they only released two albums. Latin Mass is their masterpiece. Originally released (and still) on the Metronome label, it's literally a (flawlessly performed) Latin Mass of 1970. Unfortunately, I do not have an original pressing of Latin Mass, as of this date, but the reissues are exact replica's of the original vinyl.<p>First of all; if mass really sounded like this, then I would be in church every Sunday. Unlike the traditionally-ceremonial, and restrained chuch-mass- this Latin Mass is something from another dimension. Mostly heavy, with a few soft breaks here-and-there, and very, very, emotional vocals. From start-to-finish, you have heavily distorted guitar chords, and a garage-sounding-organ playing almost non-stop. There is even a little flute on both sides of the vinyl. But, wait! It gets better! There is also a good amount of psychedelia in the album-from the ironically ominous opening of Overtüre/Kyrie/Gloria-to the brooding, heavy breathing/huffing in Credo1 (lay off the frankincense inhalation, fellas), all the way to the finale of Agnus Dei. This is terrific music.<p>For what it is, the album is flawless. You can tell that a lot of time, effort and feeling were put into this album. The instruments and the singing/vocals are perfect. Hey-after-all, these are the words of a Latin Mass, so you can't deny the emotional presence here. I'm not saying everyone will like it, but fans of heavy-prog/psych will love this album. If you like this kind of music, and don't have some hangup about the Mass-lyrics, then I can't recommend this album enough. 110% Krautrock, and a Latin Mass has never rocked so hard. Five stars.<p>Even though there is no official, Vatican-authenticated translation of a Latin Mass in English, I put an accurate translation below, for those interested.<p>Latin Mass/Songs:<p>01.

<img src="static-images/4stars.gif" alt="4 stars" border="0">
Heritage in bloom<p>First of all give it up for the most prolific reviewer here on PA, Mellotron Storm for getting me
into this album. Here´s a big warm internet hug flying through the computer screen all the way from
the windswept shores of Denmark. Thanks buddy...<p>I originally came into the wondrous world of prog through the sounds of the late 60s. Jimi, Doors,
Floyd, Lovecraft, Arthur Brown, Stones, The Dead and so forth. All those hippie bands spoke to me
about musical freedom and how such a form of expression should never be locked down in boxes. It
was the wild guitars, the bobbling hammond organs, the cryptic lyrics and that whole notion of
intrinsic musical sorcery - that was indeed what drew me in like a cat to a ball of yarn. 
The reason I´m talking about the 60s, is because of the effect it had on almost everything we dive
into on this site - be that in the development of new instruments, or maybe in the way this time in
space challenged how we think about the very nature of music. Last thing is perhaps the most
important and that is heritage. Much of what happened during the latter part of the 60s was actually
what the audience heard like echoing ripples all through the following decade. In another costume,
another shape another world.<p>Os Mundi´s 43 Minuten is a testimony to this heritage. Whilst some people call this Krautrock, I´d
stake a couple of fried llamas that it isn´t. Not to me anyway...
To me this album sounds like 3 different things - like it has 3 musical building blocks, which all
through this riveting album act like the foundation for the seemingly easy-flowing rhythmic melody
laden gymnastics.    <p>One side of the triangle sounds like Cream. Those breezy relaxing vocals hanging over the sluggishly
played guitar riffing. The second side is when the music turns jazzy, and here I´m not talking about
fusion a la Mahavishnu Orchestra going 500 miles an hour with everybody doing their own thing, no -
I´m talking about old school slow moving Sunday smooth jazz with clear parallels to the debut of
Jethro Tull. It´s obvious in the manner in which the flute is handled, but even more so felt in the
whole ambiance of the band. Chill out relax mood all over the board, and you can almost picture how
every animal in the forest would be inclined to drop by this good natured band, and a brand new Snow
White scene suddenly unfolds.
Last piece of the puzzle is by far the one with the most sway. It´s the dominant part of the music,
and luckily so also my favourite of the bunch. This one sounds like a decisively more progressive
incarnation of The Pretty Things. I hear a lot of SF Sorrow in this album, - and to tell you the
truth, that is a damn fine compliment coming from me. The vocal harmonies along with the organs -
then those spiralling rock n´ roll guitar sprees all wrapped around the familiar booming earthiness
of the blues bass incantations calling you from the deepest depths of the music. Yeah there´s
definitely something there...<p>This piggy´s got far more coils and twists to its tail than any of the mentioned bands, but the feel
of it harks back to those warm 60s´ dreamings. This might lead you to think, that 43 Minuten is an
unoriginal outing comprised of sonic re-runs and old sneakers, but strangely enough this album is
very unique - just as their first one was. Os Mundi are one of the few acts that I´ve come across,
who masters originality through the spirit and footwork of the artists preceding them. They sound
like nothing else. This album is the proof of that, and I recommend everybody who´s into the early
progressive scene to go have a listen to this fabulous record. Some parts of it are just gorgeously
beautiful, like the hauntingly played But Reality Will Show with it´s slow climaxing orgasms and a
sonic palette to it, that just takes me away like a paper cup caught in a hurricane. Swiish!!<p>If you want a cheap ticket to the beginning of our beloved prog lands, and feel like hitching a ride
instead of listening to the mumblings of old geezers in Hawaii shirts, then you should probably
start looking for this highly infatuating piece of spine massage.   </strong></strong></em></em>

This second album by the German Os Mundi appeared at a politically charged time (the 
terrorist attack during the Olympic Games in Munich, the raising of left wing political fractions, 
etc...), which is reflected in the lyrics (the singing is in English). Musically speaking, the album 
is a much eclectic beast that in turns will outline various styles and ideas: kraut rock elements 
are to be found in the long and repetitive jamming, where a simple bass riff gives the basis for 
the soloists to bring the tune to new heights; let's note especially the superb flute solo on 
"Children's Games", backed by some very supportive congas, shakers, cow bell and wah-wah 
guitar and - as said - the bass riff on which all is built up. Other tunes bring us closer to 
southern rock, with plain song structures and the necessary vocals going along (the singing 
treatment in "Children's Games" amazingly reminding of John Wetton in King Crimson). 
Psychedelism is also present (the beginning and end of "Triple" reminding slightly of early 
Kevin Ayers with Soft Machine, with their hit "We Did It Again"). It wouldn't be fair not to mention 
the cello playing of Mikro Rilling, not only adding an extra colour (sometimes together with the 
flute) but also an unusually bite (for that time). The saxophonist and flutist are throughout 
infusing a jazz and soul spirit to the music, while the use of odd meters (7/4, 9/4 spotted) or 
sudden changes of themes will ravish the proggers among you. Add a few ballads, guitars 
shining evenly in quiet or hot moments, organs here and there .... yes .... a very happy and 
eclectic album indeed!</strong></strong></em></em>

OS MUNDI were one of the first Rock bands to come out of Berlin, Germany. Their debut was 
really their "Rock" version of the "Classical" catholic mass with Latin lyrics that didn't go 
over well commercially speaking. For this their second record they changed labels and 
Conny Plank came in to produce, mix and engineer it. In fact in the liner notes they say: "We 
also owe a great debt of gratitude to our producer Conny Plank, who...became something 
like the band's father.  His influence is clear for everyone to hear when listening to the 
songs". They brought in a Free Jazz sax / flute player as well on this one. So we get a blend of 
Jazz, Rock and Fusion. I have to say that this is a great album. It's hard to believe that this 
album was recorded in one take.<p>
"A Question Of Decision" was apparently one of their favourites to play live and they would 
often extend it to 15 minutes. It opens with raw guitar as sax joins in with drums. Vocals 
before a minute. It settles with percussion before 2 minutes as the vocals stop. Guitar and 
drums join in as they jam. It kicks in after 5 minutes with flute before settling right down with 
flute. Vocals and the original melody end it. "Triple" really reminds me of VDGG with the 
vocals, sax and overall sound when it kicks in. Cello after 2 minutes as it settles.The flute 
comes and goes.That VDGG section is back late. "Missle" opens with a good beat, cello 
and prominant guitar. Great sound, vocal melodies too. Cool track. It turns powerful late. "It's 
All There" is a top three for me. Organ and a beat to open as flute then vocals join in. I just 
love how this sounds, especially the chorus. Cello comes in later. "Isn't It Beautiful 7/8" is a 
catchy instrumental with drums, percussion, congas, cello and sax.<p> "But Reality Will Show" is 
another top three tune. It really reminds me of LANDBERK to open. It settles before a minute 
with cello then reserved vocals come in. It's building as vocals become more passionate in 
this anti-war song. The intro melody returns after 3 minutes. Nice. The guitar slowly and 
tastefully plays a minute later. The vocals cry out after 5 1/2 minutes. Cello late. What a 
song ! "Children's Games" is another anti-war tune and my final top three track. It opens 
heavily with guitar, drums and vocal melodies. Vocals come in as it settles somewhat. The 
guitar starts to light it up as vocal melodies come and go. Sax before 2 minutes as themes 
are repeated.They then jam with flute and percussion. The tempo picks up 5 1/2 minutes in 
then it turns psychedelic before kicking in again. Earlier themes return. "Erstickubungen" is 
jazzy with lots of flute and drums to open. It settles after 1 1/2 minutes with cello. Kicks back 
in before 3 minutes with sax then the guitar starts to rip it up. "Fortsetzun Folgt" is a short 
instrumental with Conny Plank playing some guitar.<p>
I highly recommended this hidden treasure from 1972. My kind of music.</strong></strong></em></em>

3.5 stars really!!!<p>Out of the chaos of Berlin, but spared by the wall ignominy, a bunch of local high school kids were playing in rock or beat bands. 
Soon enough a loose aggregation formed from two of these group. Sometimes playing up to 12, and sometimes down to a quartet, 
this unit became a few years later Os Mundi (we are the world) and recorded two albums in the very early 70's, but featuring a 
sextet, even if two of them were credited as guest. OM was more of a project of Udo Arndt (organ, guitar, vocals and main 
songwriter) with the help of drummer Chris Busse (drums and lyrics) and their first album is somewhat of a masterstroke, pulling the 
equivalent of The Electric Prunes, Mass In E Minor, with the same psych tendencies, although darker and with Latin lyrics. The album 
came in 70 on the Metronome label and presented a candlelight artwork<p>OM managed to sound very professional, even if the album's production is not always so, often reminiscent of Vanilla Fudge with 
David Byron  (UH) vocals, but in the opening Overture sound very Purple-like (as in Black Night meeting Fireball), but overall, OM 
have their own sound. Plenty of lengthy instrumental interplay of complex rhythms makes this album a gem, but as mentioned 
before, the raw-atmosphered production can be discouraging a few. But the album ultra psyched and dark is very much still 60's like 
in terms of vocal filters and other sound effect, and often, we are drawn to think of Vanilla	Fudge most often, except that the 
Latin vocals are not well recorded, especially in Gloria, which cumulates the error of having a double drum solo (good in itself, but out 
of context), the often-excellent lengthy Credo is evening things out, especially in the Saucerful-era Floyd passage nd Udo's ensuing 
soaring guitar solo >> easy dramatics, but effective. <p>The second Credo is obviously taking from where the first part ended, but strikes even more the good cords. The 9-mins Sanctum is 
upping the ante even more with Markgraf switching from sax to a delicious flute, and this song is evidently close to having us believe 
in their mysticism, but the improv is taking things a bit far for a successful mass. Too bad the closing anus Dei is the weaker track on 
anotherwise strong album, though.<p>While their second album would sound quite different, developing a jazz-rock ala Kraan, early Chicago and Colosseum, Latin mass is 
certainly a good example of Germany's multi-faceted music scene, and as recommended as it could be, I'm not sure it deserves the 
essential mention, but it's definitely worth your while should you choose to make the detour by OM's two albums.  <p></strong></strong></em></em>
