<strong>Anderson / Stolt biography</strong><br />
One-Off (?) collaboration released in 2016<br><br>The idea of putting together <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=818" target="_blank"> Jon ANDERSON</a> and <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=973" target="_blank">Roine STOLT</a> came from owner of Inside Out Music, Thomas Weber in February 2014. The two were brought together on the Progressive Nation Cruise Sea, when Mike PORTNOY suggested TRANSATLANTIC to do a couple of songs with Jon. The tow began exchanging musical ideas via internet in a period of six months. Then the album was out in June 2016. Jon said to Roine that he didn't want to do a traditional Progressive Rock album, but only a Progressive music album. He wanted to take inspiration from various musical heritages and not only on the "Rock world". Roine worked with Jonas REINGOLD (bass),Felix LEHRMANN (drums), Tom BRISLIN (Keys), and others special guests on backing vocals.

<img src="static-images/3stars.gif" alt="3 stars" border="0">
"Invention of Knowledge" is the debut full-length studio album by multi-national progressive rock act Anderson/Stolt. The album was released through InsideOutMusic in June 2016. The duo lineup consists of former Yes vocalist Jon Anderson (lead and backing vocals, synthesiser, percussion) and The Flower Kings guitarist/frontman Roine Stolt (electric guitar, acoustic guitars, Dobro, Portuguese guitar, lap steel guitar, keyboards, percussion, backing vocals). Several session musicians also play and sing backing vocals/choirs on the album. Anderson/Stolt was formed in 2014 after Stolt had played as part of the backing band for Jon Anderson on a progressive rock-themed cruise. InsideOutMusic label owner Thomas Waber promised that he would provide the funding for the project, if the two musicians would agree to work together. <p>Stylistically this sounds pretty much like I expected it to sound. A Flower Kings related project but with Jon Anderson on vocals. "Invention of Knowledge" features four long tracks, which are for the most part subdivided into shorter tracks. So there is compositional complexity here which isn´t something new for neither Anderson nor Stolt. It´s definitely not an album which challenges the duo or their fans in terms of sounding vastly different from what you expect a a hybrid Yes/The Flower Kings project to sound like. Anderson has a unique voice and delivery, and when he sings you instantly know that it´s him singing. His uplifting and positive lyrics are also a trademark by now. Stolt has arranged most of the material and written most of the instrumental parts and it´s impossible not to notice his signature writing style gracing the album.<p>"Invention of Knowledge" is well produced featuring a clear, organic, and detailed sounding production job, and just like anything else about this release it´s no surprise since Stolt is responsible for the production work. So "Invention of Knowledge" is arguably a high quality progressive rock album created by two prolific veterans of the scene, but when that is said It would have been nice to hear the duo try something new and not make an album which sounds like The Flower Kings with Anderson singing. That part is slightly disappointing, but "Invention of Knowledge" is still an enjoyable listen and a 3.5 star (70%) rating is deserved.</strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/4stars.gif" alt="4 stars" border="0">
                                   Review Nº 712<p>As a teenage prog fan I was privileged to have listen and buying many of the classic albums during the early 70's. 
My passion for the genre waned however during the 80's, and it wasn't until the mid of the 90's and the 
emergence of band's like Glass Hammer, Spock's Beard and The Flower Kings, fronted by Roine Stolt, that my 
interest was rekindled. Somehow they captured and revitalised the sound and the spirit of the early 70's, whilst 
retaining their own identity.<p>However, my personal tastes have shifted towards to a darker and heavier music in the past years, in part due 
to the influences of my two sons. Still, I've always kept in constant contact with my musical roots, namely Yes, 
King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Camel, Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Van Der Graaf 
Generator, the bands that have had the longest and greatest impact during my lifetime, since my teenage 
beginning until these days.<p>Anderson and Stolt are two prog musicians that began their musical career in the 70's. Anderson is best known 
as the lead singer of the prog rock band Yes, which he co-founded in 1968 with bassist Chris Squire. He was a 
member of the band across three tenures between 1968 and 2008. Many consider him as the soul of Yes. He is 
also noted for his solo career and collaborations with some artists, including Vangelis, Roine Stolt and Jean-Luc 
Ponty. He has also appeared on albums of King Crimson, Tangerine Dream, Iron Butterfly, Mike Oldfield and 
Glass Hammer. Stolt is a Swedish guitarist, vocalist and composer. He is a major figure in the Sweden's prog rock 
history. Many consider him as the father of the Swedish prog rock. He was in two of his country's most 
successful prog rock bands, Kaipa in the 70's and The Flower Kings in the 90's. He has collaborated with other 
prog artists, participating in many other prog projects.<p>It was in that context that "Invention Of Knowledge" falls. Still and despite so many years of career of both, 
Anderson and Stolt were never together in the studio. In fact, the two met only twice. Anderson sent music to 
Stolt, including those he had worked with some of his other musical contacts years before. Anderson and Stolt 
continued to develop the original ideas via Internet, and in 2015, Stolt then put together a high class ensemble 
that recorded the music.<p>When we heard that two legendary figures of prog rock, the ex-Yes vocalist Anderson, and Stolt of The Flower 
Kings, Transatlantic, and Kaipa, would be joining together to create an album, expectations were indeed quite 
high. Thankfully, the duo didn't frustrated all those expectations, as their initial recording together, "Invention Of 
Knowledge", brings together all the elements of what we love about all the classic acts they have each been 
involved with over the years.<p>The music contained on "Invention Of Knowledge" is melodic symphonic prog rock music, filled with grand 
sweeping arrangements that allow Anderson his still enchanting vocal delivery. Stolt with his tasty guitar playing 
is great, at times seeming to pay tribute to the legendary Steve Howe. The album sounds like a meeting of Yes 
and The Flower Kings, but I don't think any of us expected anything otherwise, really. Much of "Invention Of 
Knowledge" has an epic, long form broadness that isn't unlike "Tales From Topographic Oceans" or some of The 
Flower Kings more grandiose releases such as "Unfold The Future" or "The Sum Of No Evil". The opening three 
part title suite is a perfect example of that, chock full of majestic arrangements that allow Stolt's nimble guitar 
lines to weave and battle with quirky keyboard tapestries, all while Anderson's pixie melodies grab the listener 
by the heart. "Knowing" has a more "Going For The One" feel, with a catchy melody that will instantly grab you 
much like "Wonderous Stories" did all those years ago, but at over 10 minutes long, of course it leaves plenty of 
room for alluring guitar solos, sumptuous keyboards, and some few lead seductive bass lines. The charming 
"Chase And Harmony" combines lush, pastoral sections with moments of symphonic, almost classical 
orchestrations, Stolt's guitar work at times captures the majesty of Brian May, while the emotional three part 
"Everybody Heals" suite contains some lovely Anderson's lead vocals supported by rich backing vocals and 
gorgeous piano and synthesizer works, with Stolt also dropping in a few inspired lead guitar solos. The closing 
number "Know..." pushes past the 11minute timeframe and is easily the most pastoral track here on "Invention 
Of Knowledge", filled with drifting keyboard washes, melodic guitar leads, and some Anderson's great vocal 
passages.<p>Conclusion: If you are a bit disappointed by the most recent Yes' offering, I urge you to give "Invention Of 
Knowledge" a try. You might be pleasantly surprised. "Invention Of Knowledge" maybe falls short of perfection, 
but this is prog personified and it's easily one of the strongest progressive rock albums released in the last years 
by the classic prog generation. It might sounds to you too much close to "Tales From Topographic Oceans" or to 
"Olias Of Sunhillow", but I don't care. I still love both albums. This is a majestic epic prog album, hand crafted by 
two of the legendary masters of the genre. Get your copy of this beautiful piece and thank you Anderson and 
Stolt for sharing this great music with us.<p>Prog is my Ferrari. Jem Godfrey (Frost*)</strong></strong></em></em>

I think my ears got cavities listening to this over the past week. Jon Anderson and Roine Stolt certainly seem like a 
match made in Heaven when it comes to their philosophies on life and so I wasn't too surprised to hear that this is a 
wordy album. I'm not sure if it's a concept album but it comes across that way to me with the focus on the lyrics over 
the instrumental work and compositions. They need to get the story across at any costs which is why I usually am not 
into the concept record. This at the very least is a themed album where Jon and Roine spread their flowers and love 
upon us in the YES/THE FLOWER KINGS tradition.<p> Jon's voice is in great form on here which was my biggest take 
away. I admit to having nothing to do with YES or Anderson post 80's and for good reason but he clearly was into 
singing these words. Instrumentally it's the bass that impressed me not surprisingly with Michael Stolt doing that and 
taurus bass pedals but Jonas Reingold is also here and he's a beast man. Roine comes to the fore with his familiar 
sounding guitar but again this is a vocal driven album where everything else takes a back seat. I do like how some 
songs blend into the next one over the 65 minutes and nine tracks.<p> The fourth track "Knowledge" is where we first 
get some instrumental authority with the organ helping out and it's interesting that less than half way through this 
track it becomes calm and stays that way to the end. There is a fair amount of piano on this record leading the way 
and they do contrast and repeat themes a lot. Jon says this is not progressive rock but progressive music. The closer 
"Know" is the longest at over 11 minutes and during the first half I kept thinking they had a guest female singer but 
nope that's Jon. The album ends with those piano melodies.<p> I liked this more than I thought I would but without 
question in my music world this is not close to a 4 star record. </strong></strong></em></em>

I've never been a fan of Jon Anderson's solo albums, but was intrigued by what a combination of writing skills of 
Anderson and Roine Stolt would achieve. Jon Anderson achieves his best work collaborating with other talented artists 
like Steve Howe, whose song writing idol is Bob Dylan, or with Rick Wakeman, whose classical background allows the 
structure and form for Jon Anderson's ideas to breathe. Unfortunately, I think Roine Stolt is too enamored with Jon 
Anderson's standing and reputation in the prog community to involve himself in the writing of the album and limits his 
involvement to his guitar playing skills. Other great artists contribute to the playing as well ' Jonas Reingold on bass, Tom 
Brislin on keyboards, Michael Stolt on bass and Moog and Felix Lehrmann on drums. And Jon Anderson hasn't lost any of 
the power and range of his amazing voice, despite an age pushing 70. <np><p>With such incredible musicians and an array of instruments out of prog paradise you'd think there would be enough to 
appetize the listener, but the luster of the instrumentation fades after about the second song. One doesn't know when 
one song finishes and the next starts and there is nothing memorable which sticks in the mind. There just aren't the key 
shifts in the music and the modulations that distinguishes one verse from the next and gives the music its tonality. I 
found myself persevering with the music to a point where I just found it too plodding to continue with. This is one of the 
very few albums I was unable to get to the finish listening to it. <np>

Better than most Jon Anderson solo albums.  <p>Many reviewers have suggested this album comes across as a parts Olias of Sunhillow and Tales from
Topographic Oceans, and I would not, on the whole, disagree. However, it is missing key elements of
both albums that pushed them into 'excellent' territory. On the positive side, all the music on this
album is highly listenable all the way through, which can't be said for most Jon Anderson solo
albums (which often have duds that must be skipped over, except Olias of course), and all of the
pieces here are solid even if not highly memorable. Jon Anderson's lyrics here are also pretty good
- better than a lot of his more cheesy lyrics on some of his solo albums, and his voice has kept
well - he sounds pretty darn good for a 70-year old! So, good on these scores, and worth picking up
for these reasons. On the negative side, the vocals are too constant, with insufficient instrumental
breaks. While I generally love Jon Anderson's vocals, too much of a good thing can be a bit tiring
to listen to - there is not sufficient time to wander off into the music before perking up one's
ears again for the lyrics. Related to this, while the music behind the lyrics is excellent, it is
not sufficiently the focus of the album. Often the excellent playing is too low in the mix (leaving
the vocals always up front and centre), and the musical interludes are too short. Among the great
thing about Yes (and the Flower Kings and Roine Stolt's solo work) was/is the high degree of
musicality in their instrumental sections, and you can hear right away the potential for this in
this album too, but alas there are no extended instrumental pieces (not even extended new-age-y
ethereal tails like on Olias) - AND there are not enough guitar solos! Roine Stolt is a fantastic
player and on a duet album one would like to hear him play the guitar some more (there are a number
of short solos, but most are more like bridges or transitions than real solos). Saying all this, I
don't want to give a bad impression of this album - it is actually very good for what it is and
worth hearing. I have listened to this about 10 times now, and I find a number of sections quite
musical, and nothing is off-putting. But it is not quite 4-star material. I give this album 7.7 on
my 10-point scale, which translates to 3 PA stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

When I read that Jon Anderson and Roine Stolt would collaborate, I thought 'Why hasn't this happened sooner?' Well, after returning to this album several times over a period of half a year, I can safely say that I'm thoroughly disappointed with the outcome. Now, this is not a bad album but it is neither great. The problem is the lack of diversity within the album. Each song blends seamlessly into the next and it's hard to know that you are on track four when it still sounds like track one.<p>The vocals are always out front, and Anderson's vocals are still good considering his age, but I was hoping Stolt would at least contribute one vocal track to the album. It would have adding some needed change. Then there is a distinct lack of instrumental sections. Where is the energy? There is one short jazzy instrumental section at the end of 'Everybody Heals,' yet after about ten listens over the past half year, I was hoping for more than two memorable minutes from the album. <p>And that sums up the experience for a me. A nice, mellow, uplifting album but utterly forgettable. 2.5 stars from me because two stars seems a bit too low so I'll just round it up to three.

Tales From Soporific Oceans...<p>On paper it couldn't miss: a collaboration between YES icon Jon Anderson and guitarist Roine Stolt
of THE FLOWER KINGS, in a return to the sort of long-form Symphonic Rock not heard from Anderson in
decades. The finished album was advertised (in a big sticker smack-dab on the CD cover) as "new
music in the spirit of early works such as Tales From Topographic Oceans & Olias of Sunhillow"
...strictly sales talk, but the comparison caught on, in a textbook model of autosuggestion.<p>Reviews so far have been glowing, enough to warrant a dissenting opinion. And here it is, from a
reluctant spoilsport old enough to recall when the music of Jon Anderson and Yes really did strive
toward "The Revealing Science of God".<p>As a bridge uniting two generations of Progressive Rock, the new album is built of flimsy stuff. The
original "Topographic Oceans", keep in mind, found its genesis in the ancient Hindu shastras
described by Paramahansa Yogananda in his autobiography, famously introduced to Anderson by maverick
King Crimson percussionist Jamie Muir. "Invention of Knowledge", in contrast, was born poolside
aboard a luxury Prog Rock cruise ship sailing the Caribbean, with free food, fine drinks, and a
casino belowdecks.<p>The so-called collaboration was ersatz from the start. Jon Anderson would email ideas to Sweden,
where Stolt force-fit them onto older, unreleased music of his own before sending them back to
California for more amendments (and still more lyrics) by Anderson, working alone on his home studio
computer. The only time the two were actually in the same room was during a promotional photo shoot.<p>All a sign of the times, in this Brave New World of web-linked music production. But still a lousy
way to write and record an album. It's no wonder the outcome resembled a lesser Flower Kings effort,
featuring a celebrity guest vocalist who sounds like he wandered into the studio by chance and began
singing about Ley lines before anyone could stop him.<p>Maybe Stolt was reluctant to assert himself over material developed (suggested, really) by an
obvious idol. We could have then been spared this tepid collection of uninspired soft-prog,
certainly effective in spots, but with a numbing uniformity in tone and tempo over its 65-minute
length. Olias of Sunhillow? Try Olias of Sleepy Hollow instead...<p>Mine is a minority opinion, to be sure. But no way is the album worthy of comparison to classic
Prog, sounding to this Grinch more like something the Whos of Whoville would sing while carving
their holiday roast beast. Quoting Jon Anderson himself, from an earlier and more enlightened age of
Progressive expression: What happened / To wonders / We once knew so well?</strong></strong></em></em>

Back in the 1980s, Jon Anderson was invited to sing in what was to become that decade's version of Yes.  Along with Chris Squire 
and Alan White, as well as Yes alumnus Tony Kaye, and driven by Trevor Rabin, this version of the band played a much more pop 
driven style, dancing around the fringes of prog.  But Anderson was not completely content with that.  He eventually assembled 
old friends Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe and Bill Bruford into a more traditional Yes-sounding band.<p>More recently, during an extended bout with illness, Anderson asked the Yes of that day for a break from touring.  Instead of 
either putting Yes on hiatus, or finding a temporary replacement singer, the group unceremoniously fired him.  In the years 
since, Yes has recorded two fair, but mostly unremarkable albums with two different replacement singers.  While these albums 
again have hints of that old Yes spark, they are missing some key ingredients of what Yes was about.<p>Joining up now with Roine Stolt and a band of Stolt's cohorts, Anderson has now proven that he is the keeper of the soul of Yes.<p>Their first (I do hope this band continues) album is an inspired suite of four linked songs, split into nine movements, with 
underlying themes, lyrically and musically, that weave throughout the album.  It is an uplifting, spiritual piece that sound more 
like Yes than anything the present members of the group have come up with.<p>I compare this album favorably with "Tales From Topographic Oceans", another full-album concept piece.<p>Stolt takes care to deliver the Yes sound, crafting his guitar to simulate Howe's unique technique, both in phrasing and tone.  
And both bass players that perform here, Jonas Reingold and Michael Stolt, do a fine approximation of Chris Squire's 
outstanding melodic bass lines. <p>Anderson's lyrics are in the classic Yes vein, positive and spiritual, without focusing on any particular religion or dogma.<p>On the whole, this album revives the Yes experience better than anything any of the members have released in decades.  If I 
could give any advice to the remaining Yes, it's "Do whatever you can to get Anderson back!!!!"</strong></strong></em></em>

2016 finds a certain Prog God in marvellously rude health and top form. The aforesaid award for Jon Anderson was, 
in my opinion, thoroughly well deserved. There is a tour, long promised, with fellow Yes cohorts Trevor Rabin and 
Rick Wakeman, which, to all accounts, seems to have been extremely well received. And, to start off the year, this 
collaboration with Roine Stolt, he of Flower Kings fame, with more than a little contributed by a stellar backing band, 
including the marvellous Jonas Reingold, Stolt's Kings collaborator on bass, and the wonderful Tom Brislin on keys 
(whose piano work especially on Chase and Harmony is clear and uplifting), this marking a return to working with 
Anderson.<p>The album was created over the Internet, Anderson's preferred method of recording, with vocals and musical ideas 
and compositions sent to each protagonist over the ether. The idea started when Stolt and the Transatlantic boys 
had Anderson singing Yes classics with them on one of those prog cruise trips which are in vogue at the moment. <p>Structurally, the album is, understandably, an attempt to recreate the feel of Yes classics from the Topographic 
symphonic heyday, although, perhaps more than many others who have commented on the album, I feel that Stolt 
and his unique Flower Kings sound and feel is also stamped over the work. It is not a collection of songs, as such, 
but a group of suites joining together to segue into a whole body of work. I also think that the Topographic 
comparison was, in reality, a clever marketing ploy to bring us classic Yes fans on board. They needn't have 
bothered, because the album stands up more than well enough on its own as a symphony of modern progressive 
rock, utilising the latest technology and loving production to bring a vision to life.<p>Does it work? Undeniably, yes. Those who do not buy in to Anderson's mystical view of life, the universe, and 
everything, will probably not be converted by this, because it is very much his lyrical creation, in keeping with many 
of his better solo albums. I do buy into this, so it is not a problem for me.<p>For the first few listens, in fact, you do feel that he is in danger of drowning out the music lyrically and vocally. It is 
not the case, however, when you become familiar with the album and allow it to wash over and influence you, for 
example allowing the sheer lifting beauty of We Are Truth, with Anderson sounding better than he has in years, 
accompanied by a choral backdrop, and the most beautiful soaring symphonic noise, extremely reminiscent of 
Stardust We Are period Kings (Knowing, by the way, could easily have fitted on that exceptional album), then you 
know that what you have here is classic progressive rock played by its leading proponents, classic and modern.<p>Listen to the orchestration on Everyone Heals, and then recoil at the power of Stolt's riff, before Anderson 
introduces the vocal with a fragile power one thought had been lost to us forever.<p>Some of Stolt's guitar work really is to be treasured (the delicate sounds produced on Knowledge with the sounds of 
the ocean waves lapping over it are simply wonderful), and Reingold has his fret fingers working as if it is the last 
thing he will ever do, and wants to go out on a high.<p>Both of them have promoted this album with vigour, and it quite clearly is a work of some importance to them. I 
heard Anderson on BBC Radio on more than one occasion, and he is clearly revelling in the autumn of his career. 
Given that it is only a few years since he almost died, I thank God that he has survived to carry on his musical legacy 
to the world. I also wonder what would have been had Squire and Howe showed just a little bit more patience, and 
allowed him the recovery time he needed, because one thing is for sure. This is a far better, rounded, and genuine 
"Yes" album than the debacle that was Heaven and Earth, or Fly From Here, as much as I enjoyed the suite on the 
latter.<p>This is an excellent album, which all lovers of genuine symphonic prog will want to own. For the PA rating system, 
four stars, but 4.5 if we had such a rating. I, for one, would like to see this collaboration continue to see where it 
takes them. To the stars, I think!</strong></strong></em></em>

The prolific Jon Anderson has been quite a busy man lately, having recovered from illness with a new found energy 
and passion, a trait that disproves the long held misconception that rock music is the governance of the young and 
only the young. Beyond 71 years of age, he continues to voyage into unfamiliar territories such as his long delayed 
cooperation with Jean-Luc Ponty, a thoroughly successful venture that yielded the aptly named 'Better Late than 
Never' album and subsequent well-applauded tour.  Here, he has teamed up with Swedish mastermind Roine Stolt 
of the Flower Kings and Transatlantic fame, to create a very Yes-like opus that proves only that the creative juices 
that inspired him in the glory days of progressive rock, still has a resonating voice and audience today. Sadly, the 
judgmental universe that we now live in will give way to some unfair and foolish criticism from shameless 
detractors who need to fuel their pill-fed apathy (to stay awake at the keyboard at the very least) by puncturing this 
symphonic opus with brazen detritus. Well, like they say at the hardware store: screw them! If you no like, move the 
hell on! <p>Gathering a rather stellar crew of familiar faces from both the FK, such as bassist extraordinaire Jonas Reingold, 
drummer Felix Lehrmann and former FK bassman Michael Stolt) and from the Yes side, Tom Brislin, whilst including 
the supremely talented Swedish keyboardist Lalle Larsson, the two protagonists certainly have aimed precisely at 
what they wanted to achieve, a classic sounding Progressive Rock album.  Both Anderson and Stolt have never 
sounded better and more confident, and truth be said, you can hear the enthusiasm displayed throughout. Let us 
be honest first of all, this collaboration has more musical width and breath than anything spewed by Yes since , my 
goodness' since Relayer! <p>That being said, the nine tracks do flow into one another rather seamlessly, a very linear sounding series of 
arrangements within each piece that get busy one moment and quite atmospheric the next, as on the end of 
'Knowledge', where the swirling effects really take hold. As with the Ponty collaboration, the music is totally 
uplifting, spirited if not necessarily overtly spiritual, spiced by occasional bursts of energetic gusto and dazzling 
playing by all instrumentalists. Roine can carve with the best of them, a talented guitarist who can infuse a variety 
of styles that span the gamut of influences, from Howe, Hackett and Gilmour to more oblique talents such as Allan 
Holdsworth. He can play fast, controlled and delirious when prompted. While Squire has always been a giant, Reingold is one hell of a player, seeing him live seals the deal. A monster.  <p>I also cannot help noticing that three songs contain the sound NO (as opposed to'Yes) in Know, Knowledge and Knowing. Coincidence? Nah, must be my meds. Yeah, I know (no). In fact, all the titles have a positive spin and message. Eat that Steve Wilson! <p>The glorious track 'Knowing' is an 11 minute celestial epic that reeks the most of 'Close to the Edge', owner of a 
skilled melody and some complex orchestrations, Lalle's divine grand piano, screeching synth swirls and a fully 
determined vocal performance that is easily among the very best ever captured by a microphone.  The two follow 
up pieces 'Chase & Harmony' and 'Everybody Heals' are equally masterful expressions of musical craftsmanship 
and passionate delivery. Shorter ditties offer hope and salvation, 'Better by Far' and 'Golden Light', a lovely 
diversion that goes straight to the owner of lonely Heartstrings and pulls on them delicately. The jazzy, windswept 
and airy 'Know' is an 11 minute tropical paradise of topographic ocean breezes, Jon's voice a warm zephyr that 
soothes the soul and medicates the mind, a beach with grandiose piano, shuffling bass, brushed cymbals and a laid 
back, laissez-faire attitude. 'An answer to a promise that delivered you' as Roine swirls his guitar like Carlos 
Santana. Totally delicious.  <p>I enjoyed the whole enchilada, an album that will need made more listens and new details to discover, so dense this 
is. I was expecting something a bit lamer I guess and I was wrong. The cover artwork, booklet and inlay are truly 
first-class and worth the eye candy. <p>4.5 Devices of Awareness
