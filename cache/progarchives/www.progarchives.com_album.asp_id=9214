OK, it might not be prog, but anyone who really loves rock music should get this album. 
This is the reason behind the five stars: "Burn" is a classic, no more, no less, and there's a 
lot in it for prog lovers to appreciate - for one thing, the interplay between Lord and 
Blackmore, and Paice's amazing (as always) drum work. <p>
It's also true there is a funky groove here that might not be to the taste of many prog 
fans, due to the influence of new bassist and vocalist Glenn Hughes. Now, I know I'm 
biased because Hughes is without any doubt my favourite singer, and his vocal duels with 
David Coverdale are absolutely stunning. As to Coverdale himself, before his unfortunate 
descent into hair-metal in the late '80s, he was one hell of a rock-blues vocalist to give you 
goose pimples - just listen to his performance on "Mistreated". Of course no one here 
would ever consider him a prog vocalist, but his talent and class should not be denied. By 
the way, Hughes is not credited as a writer on the sleeve because of contractual hassles, 
but his contribution to the songwriting shines quite clearly. <p>
The record's highlights, in my opinion, are the thunderous title-track, with a killer riff by the 
Man in Black and fantastic keyboard work courtesy of Mr Jon Lord, the above-
mentioned "Mistreated"  and the slower, darker "Sail Away", with an outstanding vocal 
performance by both Coverdale and Hughes. I also like the closing instrumental "A200", 
which showcases Lord's synth playing. However, all the tracks are equally worthy of 
mention. A great record by one of the best bands in rock - prog or not.</strong></strong></em></em>

All I can say is that if you need a wakeup call at any time of the day put this baby on 
and just try to keep up with these guys.  It's like none of their other albums in that 
there's really no attempt to be subtle at any point.  Between Coverdale and Hughes the 
vocals cut through the fiery rock underneath and soar with unbridled youthful 
exuberance.  Burn, Lay down stay down, and You fool no one will sear your speakers 
and Sail Away should have become an FM hit when it came out in 1974 but it just didn't 
get played enough to catch on.  Purple has always been hard rock but the quality of 
the songwriting is a definite step up from some of the other offerings that came before 
and after this one.  If I had to pick just one DP album to own, this would be the one I 
would choose.  The only throwaway is A200, which sounds like John Lord insisting on 
getting to play with his new synth.  But there may not be an album more aptly named 
than this one.  Blackmore and the band literally blaze a scorching trail.</strong></strong></em></em>

4,5 stars really!!!<p>
Although I never bought this album in CD format (I rebought all Purple albums until Made In 
Japan but stopped), I still hold my vinyl and still look at it with all the happy moments it 
gave me. Newcoming Hughes and Coverdale are both excellent additions, although one 
could wonder why Coverdale needed a secoind singer in Hughes.<p>The title track and Sail Away are simply awesome riffs showing us that Blackmore was  still 
a Riff-meister and his choice of Coverdale as a singer was another stroke of genius. The 
other two tracks rounding up side 1 are very worthy of the Purple calibre of what you 
would find in In Rock or Machine Head also. As for side 2, You Fool No-one is a rather 
correct track but will take more meaning live, while the great bluesy track Mistreated is 
clearly the cornerstone of the Mk III line-up. The album is also ending on an unusual (by 
Purple standards) instrumental track where Jon Lord shows interest in other keyboards 
than his good old Hammond organ. <p>A stunning album, showing that Blackmore was right to have disbanded the previous Mk II 
line-up after that terrible album of WDYTWA. Sadly the new blood would not sit well in the 
long term of Purple, but this is another story and let us not spoil our fun while listening to 
this album.</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>"The people laughed and she said <em>BURN</em>!"</strong>.<p>With the departure from the band of Ian Gillan and Rodger Glover, it was inevitable that the sound of Deep Purple would change. In their place came vocalist David Coverdale and bassist/vocalist Glen Hughes. While Coverdale was by implication lead vocalist, almost all of the tracks here also feature Hughes also singing lead and/or harmony.<p>Apart from the obvious change brought about by the absence of Gillan's distinctive voice, the big question was could the band still <em>cut it</em> in terms of making quality hard rock music.  With "Burn", the answer appeared to be a resounding yes. The title track kicks off the album in spectacular style with a blistering 6 minute slice of driving rock, similar to tracks such as "Fireball" and "Speed king". Ritchie Blackmore comes up with a riff to match "Smoke on the water" and fires off one of his finest solos. Jon Lord too contributes a wonderful keyboard burst. <p>The other <em>feature</em> track is "Mistreated", a sublime bluesy number with an even better solo by Blackmore. Here, Coverdale is in sole (or is that soul) control of the vocals, giving a fine, highly emotional performance. The track builds from a slow sparsely accompanied start to a striking crescendo with Blackmore's ever faster guitar being backed by descending vocalised ah-ahs. Coverdale's "I've been losing my mind" a cappella coda rounds things off perfectly. "Mistreated" is clearly a Blackmore song, indeed he would take it with him when he left for Rainbow, where it became a high point of their live act.<p>The remaining tracks are more variable, with several tending to reflect the jazz/blues influence of Hughes to a greater extent. "Sail away" is the best of the rest, but even here, the slurry vocals are far removed from the classic <I>mark 2</I> sound. "Lay down, stay down" and "What's going on here" are almost funky, while "Might just take your life" and "You fool no one" have more of a rock feel. <p>Apart from the two feature tracks, Blackmore and Lord appear to be largely pushed to the background, the twin vocals being the dominant feature of the remaining tracks. The exception is the instrumental closer "A200", although this appears to be little more than a fun jam, and something of an afterthought.<p>If this was the first album by the band, it would be held in much higher regard. Given the superb albums it followed though, "Burn" was good enough to reassure fans of the band that Deep Purple could survive. Simultaneously though, it left many slightly disappointed, and perhaps even mystified. <p>Essential listening, If only for "Burn" and "Mistreated". Great sleeve too, with the band members faces made from candle wax, which become melted images on the reverse.

The departure of Ian Gillan and Rodger Glover from Deep Purple boosted the band's 
quality as the band came around for one more good album. "Burn" takes on a classic 
Deep Purple sound, though not as heavy as 'Machine Head' or 'In Rock' but still contains 
some good rock/prog(ish) songs. The title song in particular features some very 
characteristic prog elements, namely the adaptation of classic music into rock music, in 
this case played by a pair of electric guitars and keyboards. Richie Blackmore's guitar 
work is as good here as ever and carries the album along. <p>The title song is by far the best on the album and leaves one in high hopes for the rest 
of "Burn." It soon becomes clear that the rest of the album isn't at the same standard as 
"Burn", but some of it comes close. There are some very proggy songs in "Burn", and some 
just plain hard rock structured songs. Generally speaking the songs are at quite a good 
quality which a few major highlights and really nothing which can be classified as 'bad.' 
While not up to scratch with some of the band's more famous works "Burn" still carries a 
laid back feel, despite the problems some of the members were experiencing. The 
quality of musicianship is good here, with Blackmore in the limelight on guitar. <p>
1. Burn (5/5)
2. Might Just Take Your Life (4/5)
3. Lay Down, Stay Down (3/5)
4. Sail Away (3.5/5)
5. You Fool No One (3/5)
6. What's Goin' On Here (3/5)
7. Mistreated (3/5)
8. "A" 200 (4/5)
Total = 27.5 divided by 8 = 3.437
= 3 stars<p>"Burn" is a worthy addition to your Deep Purple collection, though I wouldn't go as far as 
saying it is near the five-star level. Burn is very prominent in my mind as far as hard 
rock/prog albums go. The few very good moments in "Burn" really level the album out to 
three stars with me. I'd recommend Burn to serious Black Sabbath and/or Led Zeppelin 
fans as these two bands along with Deep Purple make up the three original English Hard 
Rock bands. All these bands are similar and contain their own special touches. "Burn" 
proved another success for Deep Purple reaching number 3 in the UK and 9 in the US.

I was different than other people's experience when it comes to what track that blew
them away at first spin of this album. "Sail Away" impressed me at first time
listening to this album! Why? I don't know exactly - it's probably its cool melody
and nice guitar riffs and smooth musical flow. Most people would say that the album
title track "Burn" was the first impression. It does not mean that I don't like this
track - I love it indeed. But it was not my first impression. When I got the cassette
repeated, I found "You Fool No One" was very interesting - especially I enjoyed how
Ian Paice played his dynamic drum work. And then .. I loved "Burn" especially on
musical interlude where Ritchie and Jon Lord give their solo part.<p>Music critics (including AKTUIL - an Indonesian rock music magazine which was very
famous at that time) was wondering on replacement of Roger Glover and Ian Gillan on
this album. But Deep Purple proved themselves that they were still "Deep Purple" even
though with major personnel changes. The hiring of Coverdale and Hughes was a right
decision as both could deliver their skills excellently. In fact, until now I still
prefer track "Burn" compared to other Gillan's tracks like the boring "Smoke On The
Water" and "Highway Star" (uuugghhh . so boring hearing these two tracks!). In terms
of musical tastes, "Burn" gives wider horizon from one song to another. Enjoy the
first track "Burn" and then "Might Just Take Your Life" - you will get the major
change in nuance. It stays constant until "Lay Down, Stay Down" but it's then
different nuance again with "Sail Away". <p>It's an excellent hard rock music.<p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>

The title track for me on Burn is what makes this album stand out. Dave Coverdale replaced 
IG on vocals and what an excellent replacement he turned out to be. This album really 
rocks with great tempos throughout. Richie Blackmore as ever working magic with those 
incredible guitar riffs. Overall the album gets a solid 4 stars. ' Sail Away' and ' Mistreated' 
aslo great tracks. After hearing the Ian Gillan Band after his departure and what Ian Gillan 
did whilst with Deep Purple you wonder why he changed direction? A spiritual journey so I 
am told.Deep Purple with Dave Coverdale were solid on this album and Burn also received a 
positive commercial response from the market place.</strong></strong></em></em>

<img src="static-images/4stars.gif" alt="4 stars" border="0">
Mark III. The end of an era. The start of a new one.<p>The first earthquake in terms of line-up in one of my preferred bands (more to come 
unfortunately with my beloved Yes and Genesis). 
I was so thrilled to listen to their new LP that I rushed out and bought "Burn" as soon as 
it came out. To be honest, this album is quite brilliant. I already had heard most of it 
two months BEFORE its release (see the PS section at the end of the review to know 
more).<p>"Burn" is a mythical song which will never reach the live glory of some of its 
predecessors (only due to the fact that Gillan never wanted to perform this track in 
concert during other Marks). <p>The riff is pretty similar to the one of "Flight Of A Rat" from "In Rock" (one of their 
greatest number IMO and so much underrated).
Coverdale's work here is absolutely grandiose: with this opener he shows how great a 
singer he is.<p>It is said that he was so scared about Ritchie's reaction to his lyrics, that he came with 
three different ones for that song!<p>In terms of musical breaks, the keys are strongly linked with "Highway Star": hard but 
melodic. Jon is simply FABULOUS as he is most of the time.
Again, the structure here is Purplesque in all its grandeur and the lenght is OK. 
This will be a great opener of their live sets (Mark III).<p>"Might Just Take Your Life" is a standard hard rock tune like Purple have produced quite a lot ("Bloodsucker", "Maybe I'm A Leo"... ). Average.<p>Next comes "Lay Down, Stay Down" which is quite a bloody good hard rocking tune: 
there is virtually no difference with the legendary line-up: bass and vocals are superb, 
guitar and keys are of course fabulous. Paice as great as ever. 
The vocal parts are gorgeous : both David and Glenn sharing the effort. Another highlight.<p>"Sail Away" closes side one quite beautifully. Standard hard rock song of the purest 
vein. Slower tempo, strong bass and great vocals. The latter one will really be a TM for 
Mark III.
Not a highlight, but a good moment (which is sufficient to maintain the level of this 
album to a very high).<p>Let's spin B-side now.<p>"You Fool no One" is a clone for "The Mule", and is another great song : vocals are 
huge (both David / Glenn) and Ritchie, just superb.<p>"What's Going on Here" is another OK hard rock song. But "Mistreated" is quite different : the best (with "Burn") song of the mark III era. Bluesy, 
guitar mystical: it is one of their best song ever. <p>Unfortunately again not performed in their live sets with Gillan. It almost reaches the 
level of "Since I've Been Lovin' You" from Led Zep in terms of the best "white" blues 
song ever written/performed. Of course, there is no such guitar solo than Jimi's one but 
hell! Mistreated is a fabulous track. Just listen to the last part of the song to be 
charmed. A piece of anthology and a highlight of course.<p>The closing number "A 200" is a "Bolero" influenced instrumental. Not that great.<p>The remastered edition has five bonus tracks, of which "Coronarias Redig" is an 
obscure B-side for "Might Just Take Your Life" released in some countries only (Belgium, 
The Netherlands, Spain, Germany and France). this intrumental track is quite 
dispensable as you can imagine.<p>The other four are "remixes" but really close to the original. not essential.<p>With "Burn", Purple obviously wanted to reproduce "Machine Head" and almost 
reached it.
Mark II did a similar attempt (but failed dramatically) with "Who Do We Think".<p>The fantastic duo Coverdale / Hughes is really incredible (and very much credible): their complementarity is simply gorgeous and brings this Purple album to a very high 
level.<p>Four stars for this marvelous and surprisingly effort (nine out of ten actually). By the 
way, when will this rating be switched on)? 
A scale of ten would be more precise, no?<p>PS :<p>I was very fortunate to see the Mark III during one of its very first live concert.
Figure out: they started their European live tour in Arhus (Denmark) on the 8th of 
December, 1973. This show was cancelled because the equipment never arrived. 
The opening concert took place in  Hallen (Denmark), the second in Gothenburgh and 
the third one in ... Brussels on December 12th, 1973. <p>A drama took place in the afternoon of the concert (a Wednesday). 
Actually, I could not  find my ticket for the concert anymore.
The price was 220 BEF (the equivalent of 5.5 ?)!
Unlike the Mark II concert I saw at the same venue (Forest National) in March of the 
same year, this one was not sold out; so I had to struggle to convinced my mother that 
I was so desperate to see the Purple that I was willing to buy a ticket for the second 
time. <p>After a very long and difficult conversation, she finally accepted to allow me to do 
so. In the meantime, the clock was running and to ensure I would be on time, I had to 
take a taxi to the venue (sharing it with two friends) making it an even more expensive 
evening. <p>But I was there and just to water your mouth, here is the typical setlist of this tour : 1. 
Burn, 2. Might Just Take Your Life, 3. Lay Down, Stay Down, 4. Mistreated, 5. Smoke 
on the Water, 6. You Fool no One, 7. Space Truckin' (quite extended as usual in those 
days), 8. What's Going on Here.<p>If you have read my review for "In Concert" from the BBC, you will know that CD two, 
consists of the live rendition of most of the "Machine Head" album. It took place a few 
weeks BEFORE its release.<p>So, I have been in the same situation for "Burn". A great souvenir, my friends.

OK prepare to bow down at the temple of THE DP line up. <p>Mr Ian Paice ... this is his album. Burn/You Fool No One/Lay down Stay Down. Toe tap your way out of that one. Alex VH has
Hot for Teacher ... ian just plays BURN. Might Just Take Your life: absolutely fabulous track. Great rhythm, superb drums
(Hughes' bass tucked in).<p>The amazing vocals of Mr Coverdale and Mr Hughes. The RB maintains his presence with unmistakable licks. What's Going On Here

Maybe "Burn" is not a masterpiece of progressive rock, but it surely is a masterpiece of classic heavy rock! Absolutely all tracks on 
this Mark III release are great. Addition of two new vocalists (Coverdale and Hughues) was an essential innovation that helped the 
band stay on the charts after the crisis caused by the departure of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover. <p>Highlights include the heavy -symphonic prog leanings in the title track and the instrumental "A 200", funky spices in "Sail Away", 
powerful hard rocking in "Might Just Take Your Life" and "You Fool No One", along with heavy dark and goosebumping  blues 
of "Mistreated"! Production and arrangements are perfect while the songs are structured in a way that prevents many unnecessary 
over-indulgent solos - a fact that sometimes used to spoil their earlier works (at least in my opinion). Solo parts here are effective 
and well-conducted. <p>Glenn Hughues's vocals and bass playing are a real treat and too bad this line-up of DEEP PURPLE (Mark III) recorded only one more 
studio album. "Burn" is excellent album in many ways and I can freely recommend it to all prog listeners who usually are not in fond 
of heavy metal or hard rock in general.<p>PERSONAL RATING: 4,5/5<p>P.A. RATING: 5/5</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>What's going on here?</strong><p>This album was something of a rebirth for the band after the rather lacklustre Who Do We Think We Are album. The rebirth consisted at least partly in a rather radical line-up change: David Coverdale replaced Ian Gillan on lead vocals and Glenn Hughes replaced Roger Glover on bass and also added additional lead vocals. Burn was also the first Deep Purple album to include synthesisers, which perhaps makes it slightly progressive on the opening track and the instrumental closer A 200. The songs in between, however, are far from progressive. Instead, these are rather funky Blues rockers with some interesting bits here and there.<p>The title track deserves further mention. The guitar and keyboard solos on this song are great, and perhaps the earliest example of Neo-Classical Metal? Very Classically influenced anyway, and very well structured solos, far away from mindless improvisation that sometimes haunted Deep Purple's earlier efforts. The riff of the song is good as well, but unfortunately it is repeated too many times to make this a truly great song for me. They should perhaps have made it shorter, or added an additional riff to the mix? Still, I love to listen to this song and because of the solos in the middle it is one of my favourite Deep Purple songs of all time! Also the aforementioned closing instrumental A 200 is an interesting piece where the great Lord is allowed to shine.<p>Mistreated is often considered a classic, but I have never liked this strongly bluesy number!<p>Burn was a bit better recorded and produced compared to most earlier albums. Unfortunately, these improvements in instrumentation and production coincided with them going in more of a straightforward Blues rock directionon on several tracks. They are still fun to listen to, but they are not really that exciting and have very little to do with Prog.<p>Burn is therefore perhaps not the best place to start for Prog fans who want to explore Deep Purple. You should probably start with Fireball or Machine Head. And if you still want more after that, then Burn is a good choice!

A magnificent work by Deep Purple MK III. It was the first time I ever heard about the band and I 
remember as a teenager how much I loved the cover! At the time this album was despised by a lot of 
Purple fans since they could not bear the thought of losing singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. I 
didn't agree at all. Burn was a fantastic CD in my opinion and it was always a favorite. Besides, after 
the very weak Who Do We Think We Are, what those radicals should expect? Decisions had to be 
made. And they were for the better.<p>A lot of the flak came for the fact the chosen singer, David Coverdale, was a complete unknown and 
did not have a voice as powerful as Gillan. True. Coverdale was still a bit green then but had a fine 
voice and, besides, with Glenn Hughes sharing the leads with him, they covered the vocals issue way 
better than anyone expected. Those two together could outdo Gillan anytime. The voices are maybe 
the most distinguishing aspect of the whole album. Awesome!<p>The older this album becomes the more I get the feeling Burn is very close to a masterpiece. At least 
three tracks are absolute classics: the title track, Sail Away and Mistreated. The remaining songs are 
also very good, although not really par to those three. I was amazed to see how much Jon Lord had 
grown since those early years with Deep Purple: the man is simply a genius! Burn also marked the first 
time he used synthesizers in a DP record. He also does a great honk tonk piano solo on What's Goin' 
On Here. But he still remains one of the masters of the Hammond Organ. His solo o the title track is 
Bach meets metal, one of the most influential of rock's history. <p>Ritchie Blackmore is in top form, although it is also clear he was not really satisfied with the new funk 
and soul influences Coverdale and - mainly - Hughes brought with them, but that's another story. Just 
hear the opening riff of Mistreated! A band with two iconic figures as Blackmore and Lord should be 
heard with care. Everything works incredibly well for a record done in such a hurry. Martin Birch's 
production is outstanding as ever: no wonder he became such a legend over the years. Even for 
today's standards the sound is crisp, clean, powerful. <p>If PA was a hard rock or Heavy Metal site I would give this album a 5 star rating. In many ways this is 
a groundbreaking and unique CD. It does have strong prog leanings that would influence most of the 
prog metal bands in the future generation. But since the band had already done such masterpieces as 
Machine Head and Made In Japan, this is a tad inferior to those.  4 stars would be more fitting. 4,5 for 
personal reasons. Highly recommended.</strong></strong></em></em>

Burn from 1974 is an underrated album, I find it very strong Purple release. This is the first album where 
we can hear to famouses musicians  - Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale. Hughes was already a well 
known musician, who came from a great band from early '70's Trapeze, Coverdale still un unknown singer 
in 1974 , who will make his own band in late '70's Whitesnake and made one of a hell of career in 
the '80's. So the album Burn is a great one with tight musicianship and excelent voice of Coverdale. Purple 
being still in bussines with this album, they capture new grounds with this release, sometimes we can hear 
some hard boogie arrangements like:You Fool No One, but not bad at all. Coverdale's voice is the chery 
on the cake here delivering some stunning vocal parts like on: Sail Away and Mistreated. As a whole all 
the musicians did a great job, remaining Deep Purple all the way. I will give 4 star without hesitation, a 
great album and very present today, even quite better than the next one or the previous one. </strong></strong></em></em>

Though Deep Purple wouldn't quite record another explosive album like 'In Rock' in the studio, it did record a very well written and performed album called 'Burn'. With two great vocalist, David Coverdale and Glen Hughes, the band would introduce an exciting rocksong format in which both performers would enhance the music by switching leads between verses, bridges and refrains. The album fires one memorable songs after another and whilst the rhythm and blues influences are clearly the basis of the music, there's enough room for deviating from the path. The fast-paced hardrock opener 'Burn' with its exciting transitions between parts and brilliant vocals  sets the tone perfectly. To me this song sounds a bit like the hardrock follow-up of the Beatles song 'Help'. 'Mistreated' is a perfect bluesrock song and the album ends surprisingly with an instrumental progressive rock piece called 'A 200' - a tradition that many bands would follow. The recording of the album is tad bright and on some stereo sets a little extra bass doesn't hurt. I would agree with Bonnek that this album, together with 'In Rock' and 'Made in Japan', form the best trio of albums you could own of Deep Purple. The live footage of California '74 shows this Mark III configuration of the band on fire and also comes highly recommended. </strong></strong></em></em>

The new beginning for Deep Purple - one of the most influential rock bands of all time. After the
weakest album for the band - Who Do We Think We Are - it's time for Deep Purple to rock very hard again.
This time with new members on the board - Glenn Hughes and Daivd Coverdale, instead of Roger Glover
and Ian Gillan. The genre is very different from the typical hard rock between 1970 and 1972. Here
we have soul, funk and blues rock elements constructed in remarkable way. One of the most memorable
album by Deep Purple. From the beginning to the end all songs show the musical and songwriting
abilities of the band members. Every little song here is like a gem in the crown of rock music as
whole! 4 stars!</strong></strong></em></em>

With <em>Burn</em> Blackmore has performed the final takeover of the Deep Purple household. Gillan and
Glover got replaced by Coverdale and Hughes and this gave Blackmore the lead to steer the band into
a hard rocking guitar-focussed blast of an album.<p>Coverdale and Hughes prove to be a great vocal duo that pleases me every bit as much as Gillan did.
Of course their soulful delivery makes this album into an entirely different Purple experience. Not
all tracks are top notch but with <em>Burn</em>, <em>Sail Away</em>,<em>You Fool No
One</em>, <em>Mistreated</em> and <em>'A' 200</em> the album has some of Purple's best songs and they cover a
lot of ground ranging from hard-rock, soul, blues to proggy moogs.<p>Even though it is not entirely consistent, I would rate it as the third essential album for Deep
Purple next to <em>In Rock</em> and <em>Made In Japan</em>.</strong></strong></em></em>

After the undeniable flop that was <em>Who Do We Think We Are</em> damage control was in order and some heads had to roll.<p>
Once both Roger and Ian departed Deep Purple was once again where they were in 1969 and two replacements were hired to recreate the quintet. The MKIII lineup was by no means back at square one since the previous studio albums and notorious live performances have earned the band a massive following. The addition of then unknown vocalist David Coverdale and the amazing bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes completely revitalized the band's sound.<p>
It was also around 1973 that Jon Lord and his keyboard technician, Stuart Wickes, combined the Hammond C3 Organ with the RMI. Lord then pushed the Hammond-Leslie sound through Marshall amplification, creating a growling/heavy/mechanical sound that gave a rhythmic counterpoint to Blackmore's lead playing. This innovation allowed Lord to get back in the game and compete with Blackmore as a soloist, with an organ that sounded as heavy as a lead guitar. With all these new addition to the band it felt like Deep Purple just could do no wrong and the final result definitely spoke for itself.<p>
This is easily my second favorite Deep Purple studio release surpassed only by the landmark that is <em>Machine Head</em>. Every composition adds some new layers to the music and although I don't consider myself much of a funky blues fan, that material definitely works as well. The tradition of a strong heavy hitting album opener has found its way onto <em>Burn</em> and the album titled track is a real killer featuring the best solo work from the Blackmore/Lord team. Although I think that <em>Burn</em> is a great intro track I usually prefer starting the album with the instrumental piece <em>A 200</em>. This means that I start off by listening to track nr.8 and then go through 1 to 7 (ending on <em>Mistreated</em>)! This also works better because <em>Mistreated</em> has a cool ending that reminds me a bit of <em>Stairway To Heaven</em>, which makes it sound like the great album conclusion that Led Zeppelin never implemented!<p>
With <em>Burn</em> the band managed to revitalize their sound and the new vocalist duo of Coverdale and Hughes is in my opinion superior to Ian Gillian. Although their two very distinct styles the vocal duo complements each other phenomenally here and we even get a few vocal harmony sections.
In conclusion, <em>Burn</em> is another important landmark album in Deep Purple's mixed discography and a worthy addition to any Hard Rock music collection. Unfortunately even this lineup couldn't deliver on the greatness featured here and after the shaky <em>Stormbringer</em> Ritchie Blackmore called it a day, putting an end to the wonderful MKIII lineup.<p>***** star songs: Burn (6:00) "A" 200 (3:51)<p>**** star songs: Might Just Take Your Life (4:36) Lay Down, Stay Down (4:15) Sail Away (5:48) You Fool No One (4:47) Mistreated (7:25)<p>*** star songs: What's Goin' On Here (4:55)</strong></strong></em></em>

In came David Coverdale (later of Whitesnake fame, ugh) as lead vocalist and Glenn Hughes (later 
of mid-80's Sabbath "fame," double ugh) as bassist and vocalist. Maybe Ritchie thought these 
moves would revitalize the band - instead they gave him enough heartburn and stomach cramps to 
leave by 1975. Now, don't get me wrong - I'm sure there are lots of people in this world who are 
perfectly happy with generic mid-70's cock rock crossed with perfunctory funk. It's just that I'm not; 
it's simply not enough for me for music to kinda "rock, dude." I need my hard rock to stand out in 
some way, with great riffs or speed or whatever, and not just plod its mid-tempo keester like 2nd-
rate Bad Company.<p><p>Ok, ok, so the band once again managed to include a major classic as the opening track. Yup, the 
title track is basically a lock for best DP Mk. 3 number, combining an utterly awesome speedy 
guitar/organ riff with what can actually be considered a decent singing performance from David and 
Glenn. Ok, so Dave's voice is a little dull for my heart, and Glenn's voice tends to sound like a 
cross between bad hair-metal vocals and mediocre soul-vocals, but at least on this track, they 
combine into something that sounds halfway decent. Then again, though, one doesn't exactly look 
to a song like this for the vocals - it's for the riff and energetic solos, which easily live up to the 
reputation that Ritchie and Jon built up for themselves in Mk. 2. I could live without some of the 
synths near the end, but that's just a slight complaint.<p>Unfortunately, the opening is extremely deceptive, and not just because none of the other songs 
are fast rockers. The title track exudes power and inspiration and all sorts of good things, while 
most of the other tracks simply <em>don't</em>. There are some exceptions, of course; the most 
notable is the bluesy "Mistreated," which makes good use of David's vocals, which augment the 
power of Ritchie's riff and moody solos quite well. "Sail Away" is alright thanks to a fine funky guitar 
riff (too often augmented by some awful synth sounds, though), even though the vocals strike me 
as obnoxious in more than a couple of places. And, er, "Might Just Take Your Life" at least has a 
couple of decent hooks to go with its generic cock-rockitude.<p>But sheesh, the rest of the album? "Lay Down Stay Down" is basically David and Glenn 
screaming/wailing/whatever over instrumental parts that never enter an involving or memorable 
groove, "You Fool No One" only interests me in terms of the funky drumming, "What's Going On 
Here" comes closer to the definition of generic cock-rock than I knew was possible, and the closing 
instrumental ... Ugh. Behold Jon Lord tying a rondo rhythm to a bunch of awful synth noises and an 
ok guitar solo. Is this supposed to be majestic? "Artistic?" Whatever.  Just find the title track 
and "Mistreated," and screw the rest.</strong></strong></em></em>

A mini-revival of sorts.  I would have called this a full-fledged revival had the lineup lasted
longer than it did, but then again, Purple's lineup has constantly been shaky.<p>I'm sure Purple fans at the time were wondering how the band would survive without Ian Gillan (and
Roger Glover to a lesser extent), but the band brought in two singers in Coverdale and Hughes.  BURN
has more harmony vocals than anything Purple did earlier, and the tradeoff lead vocals give the band
a new freshness to them.<p>One complaint I have with the vocals is that I find Glenn Hughes to be the de facto better singer;
Coverdale sounds like a Robert Plant imitator that's too husky to hit the high notes.  The scratches
in Coverdale's voice works well on ''Mistreated'', and when he stays in baritone range, he's fine. 
But hearing Hughes sing is another stratosphere of excellence; I had heard much about how his voice
was praised before I heard BURN, and I'm amongst the praising now.  The tone and power alone seal it
for me.<p>Most of the rest of what Deep Purple is known for is right here.  Blackmore and Paice are still
Blackmore and Paice, and the song ''Burn'' is no better example of what they can do on this album. 
Lord seems to soften his stance on Hammond here (although he tinkered with other equipment earlier
in Deep Purple's career like the harpsichord on ''Blind''), toying around with synths on the
occasion.  Notably is the finale/best track ''A 200''; an opening that could fit nicely into a
Tangerine Dream piece along with a crashing main theme is the kick in the pants the band needed.<p>For prog fans, keep in mind that other than ''A 200'', we're not much into prog territory.  Deep
Purple have established themselves as hard rock act, and that's pretty much what BURN is.  Sure
songs like ''You Fool No One'' and ''Sail Away'' see funk creep into the mould, but this is hard
rock terra firma.

Kick in the Nards.<p>That's exactly how I felt when I listened to Burn the first time (with appropriate volume of course). I 
immediately checked after if I wetted myself. A hurricane of ballsy vocals, a tornado of drums, a 
typhoon of guitars arpeggios..well, you get the idea. That's what I call a powerful record, with a 
standing ovation to the title track who will break your spine with air guitaring.<p>Especially for Yngwie Malmsteen, who's career is to replicate this album over and over, this must have 
been a revelation with the 4 horsemen howling in a cloud of 3D fire. I cannot express more how a 
vintage band like this one could move me that much. I always thought that the Zep was above 
because of all the timeless songs we know from them, but Blackmood, Paice and Coverdale are all-
out in a war with no prisonners. Dang it, this is an anthem to every metal that came after (hello 
Maiden). They didn't knew it at the time, but they created an ear scorcher right here.<p>Anyhow, a record that starts extremely strong (like many Purple records) and tangents to blues-rock, but this time the writing is well inspired for most of the record.<p>I discovered the grandfathers of what I love way too late.</strong></strong></em></em>

Deep Purple bands tend to refer to the different lineups of the band as "Deep Purple Mark I", "Deep Purple Mark II" and so on, almost as though they are different bands, and on the basis of Burn I'd say there's some merit to that approach. This is the debut of Deep Purple Mark III, which sees Ian Gillian and Roger Glover being replaced by Dave Coverdale and Glenn Hughes.<p>Some bands try to push on with business as usual when they have a lineup change, but I really respect the way Deep Purple see their personnel shift as an opportunity rather than a problem, taking it as chance to experiment with their sound and really develop it to the next level and accommodate the new strengths of the incoming members. Coverdale does a superb job on vocals here, but he's able to pull it off because the band's new swampy, funky style - with the blues influence on their sound really teased out here and there - brilliantly supports his particular vocal approach.<p>No, it's not quite the same if you're in it for material like Child In Time or Highway Star - but then again I'm sure Deep Purple Mark II was a bit of a shock for people who wanted more stuff like Hush or Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Circumstances change, and here Deep Purple change with them in order to come out stronger. I can honestly say I find this album more consistent than any of the Mark II albums. At the same time, as far as straight-ahead mid-1970s hard rock goes, whilst it is a solid example of that form the likes of Kiss and others were already putting out superior examples of the form.</strong></strong></em></em>

In mid 1973, Ian Gillan and Roger Glover left DEEP PURPLE apparently due to some personal 
problems with some members of the band and with the management. Gillan has said in interviews 
that it was mainly due to a lot of work: "We were burned up. We needed a break, but the 
management wanted more work from us" (more or less as I remember). So, they finally left the band 
after one more tour.<p>They were replaced by David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, respectively, with both musicians 
having powerful vocals. So the band for the first and only time had two  members who could sing 
lead vocals, but  the role of  the main lead singer was assigned  to David Coverdale. Anyway, 
Hughes sang powerful backing vocals and also sometimes he had the chance to sing lead vocals in 
some songs. Their vocals sung  together worked very well in the band. But, at the same time with 
this approach on vocals the band sounded different. Still good but different.  But also due to their 
musical influences (with Hughes having a more Blues,  Funky  and Soul influenced musical style) the 
band gradually became more inlfuenced by them and gradually started sounding very different and 
far from the original musical style that the band had since they started in 1968. This led to Ritchie 
Blackmore`s departure in 1975.<p>This "Burn" album from 1974 shows the first signs of that musical transition of the band from Hard 
Rock / Heavy Metal to a more Blues, Funky and Soul musical style which was more clear in their 
"Stormbringer" album, and later with their "Come Taste the Band" (an album which was recorded 
with Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore). But most of the songs in this "Burn" album still show the 
original style of the band being very present. The title track is maybe the best from this album, with 
some good guitar riffs and some Classical Music influences in the arrangements from Blackmore and 
Jon Lord in their respective instruments., sounding very  influenced by Progressive Rock music. 
Other strong songs in this album are "Might Just Take Your Life ", "Mistreated" and  the instrumental 
"A 200" (with this last song being somewhat similar to "Coronaria`s Redig", another instrumental 
song from the same recording sessions of this album but which was released as the "B" side of a 
single from the same period). <p>As a whole, this album still sounds more  in the original musical style of the band, and it still is a good 
album from them.</strong></strong></em></em>

There's a lot to like about this thick, bottom-heavy, bluesy, hard-rockin' classic album by Deep Purple. The combination of 
vocals by Coverdale and Hughes gives the tunes a gruff, masculine appeal; the rhythm section cooks with energy; interplay 
between keyboards and guitar adds a depth to the songs; the impeccable guitar of Blackmore... However, for me, none of 
those steal the show on Burn. It's an album that really is the sum of its parts, and each one works very well together to create a 
great hard-rock experience that's hard to beat. Though I enjoy Blackmore's Rainbow project more than Deep Purple, I find 
myself grooving hard throughout this album, which doesn't have a bad track on it.<p>Highly recommended for any reader who enjoys hard rock, who will find Deep Purple offering more energy and artistry in Burn 
that you'll likely ever hear on classic rock radio.<p>Burn is a great album from the greatest era of rock-n-roll.<p>Songwriting: 3 - Instrumental Performances: 4 - Lyrics/Vocals: 4 - Style/Emotion/Replay: 4</strong></strong></em></em>

Although I have always enjoyed Deep Purple, I hadn't bothered buying much of their albums but sporadically, probably due to a 
lot of my years spent on buying more obscure stuff, but since a lot of the obscure stuff is just costing too much (the Italian prog, 
for example), I had to concentrate on lesser obscure stuff, like the Doors or Deep Purple for some catch up work. Burn brought 
in an then-unknown David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes from Trapeze, and for many, it's an improvement over Who Do We 
Think We Are (although I thought that one was underrated and I enjoyed that one too). It's been said the Coverdale and Hughes 
had brought in soul and funk influences in the band, but that's pretty much toned down on Burn, but brought much more in the 
front on their next one, Stormbringer. I remembered as a kid hearing the title track on the radio, it doesn't get the recognition 
of "Smoke on the Water", but still full of great guitar playing from Ritchie Blackmore, and Jon Lord does some extended organ, 
and even synth solos here. "Might Just Take Your Life" really features a nice organ riff from Lord, but for the most part, a bit on 
the bluesy side (Deep Purple only proves how much early heavy metal was rooted in the blues). "Lay Day, Stay Down" shows a 
bit of that boogie influence, but at least Blackmore made sure it still stayed in the hard rock/early metal vein. "Sail Away" is a bit 
on the funky side that I really like. The vocals sound deeper, so it's probably not Coverdale singing this one, but Hughes. Check 
out that big fat Moog solo Lord gives, it's brief, but you could imagine that coming out of a modular Moog, although it was a 
MiniMoog (except for ELP, and some electronic artists like Tangerine Dream, the modular Moog was pretty much passe in the 
prog rock world by 1974). "Mistreated" is another one of those bluesy numbers, while "A" 200", clearly John Lord's is much more 
in the prog vein, and is the one song that progheads are most likely to enjoy. But then Deep Purple did help to pioneer metal, 
but they frequently had prog tendencies from time to time. This particular song even had a little bit of Mellotron (Mellotron also 
appeared on Stormbringer, as well as The Book of Taleisyn on "Anthem"). While it's clear Burn isn't as great as the best Mark II 
lineup albums, it certainly is still very much well worth having, and still sounds like a Deep Purple album.</strong></strong></em></em>

Deep Purple was still riding high and even after the release of the disappointing and tired sounding "Who Do We Think 
We Are?", DP was still considered the top selling artist of 1973 in the States.  The band, however, was exhausted from 
all of the touring and recording and emotions and egos were getting in the way.  Gillan and Blackmore were not getting 
along, so Gillan left the band high and dry.  If that weren't enough, Blackmore insisted that Glover (bass) be dismissed.  
This was risky business especially with the band doing so well.<p>After frequenting some "Trapeze" concerts, the band hired Glenn Hughes on the promise that they were considering 
Paul Rodgers ("Free") as a co-vocalist.  Rodgers was busy starting the band "Bad Company" at the time, so he ended up 
passing on that offer.  Instead, DP ended up hiring David Coverdale, who was unheard of at that time, but who would 
eventually be lead singer for "Whitesnake".  With these two new additions, the band made what was probably their first 
major line-up change (all at one time) in their history.  Of course, there was bound to be a major shift in the band's 
overall sound.  That is exactly what happened.<p>"Burn" was the first studio album released with the new Mark III line-up.  The sound was now shifted away from the 
heavy-blues-inspired psychedelic sound to a more soulful and rock-boogie style.  Surprisingly enough, the band made 
the transition quite well at first, and this is apparent with this album, which turned out to sound much more relaxed 
and thought out than the previous album.  The title track starts the album off on fast rocking note that would end up 
being the barn-burner that would replace "Highway Star" as the opener in their concerts.  The double team of 
Coverdale and Hughes would give a nice variety to the sound with the both of them sharing lead vocal duties, 
sometimes within the same song.  However, the both of them didn't have the explosive sound and range of Gillan.  So 
while the music was more soulful, it seemed to be missing the drive and the punch that it used to have.  Blackmore 
does seem to have more solo time on this studio album than before, but then Lord's solo time is cut back some, and 
the songs are more vocally driven than before.  There is a noticeable lack of the excellent instrumental sections than 
there were previously, and even though listeners heard a bit of that in the previous album, now it seems to be the case 
more than ever.<p>The first half of the album, after the first track, demonstrates how that lack of drive could make their music sound too 
much the same, and there are only a few instances where anything really stands out.  The 2nd half, however, is much 
better with "You Fool No One", "What's Goin' On Here" and "Mistreated" sounding like it was going to be easy to get 
used to this new sound, all three of these tracks being heavy, catchy and top notch performances.  The last track "A 
200" is an instrumental that, however, seems to lose any energy that was generated from those three tracks that 
precede it.  However, the album sounds somewhat promising and is a step up from the previous album.  There was a 
lot of hope here that things would continue to get better with this new line-up and this hopefulness was translated into 
continued high sales with this album and the follow up "Stormbringer", which would end up adding more elements of 
funk and soul while concentrating on shorter, more accessible tracks, something that would cause even more issues 
within the band.  But, for now at least, the band looked like it might still be sitting comfortably.<p>In the end, there are 4 great tracks and 4 that are just good, with an ending track that leaves you wishing for something 
better.  Yes it's better than "WDWTWA?", but not quite good enough to push it up to 4 stars in my opinion.  Almost, but 
not quite.

Deep Purple's Burn surfaced at the height of their fame as 
progenitors of British proto metal. The classic lineup 
consisted of David Coverdale's vocals, Ritchie Blackmore's axe 
work,  Jon Lord's keyboard wizardry, Glen Hughes bass, and 
Ian Paice on the boom booms. They burst out of the gate with 
a frantic pace on Burn, the most beloved of all these tracks. 
The melody and vocals are infectious and the musicianship 
sizzles like flaming embers. The percussion of Paice cooks and 
Lord's keys grind up a storm. <p>Might Just Take Your Life is motored by organ shreds in a 
bluesy rhythm. The harmonies are wonderful and 
Blackmore's lead breaks are scorching. <p>Lay Down, Stay Down has some great riffing and an ice cool 
lead break. <p>The pace becomes a slow burn on 
Sail Away that features a catchy melody and Coverdale in fine 
form. <p>You Fool No One has Paice locked in a rhumba rhythm and 
harmonies throughout. An oddity in Purple's catalogue and 
again Coverdale is a powerhouse on vocals. The lead break 
ascends to some high note fret work. <p>What's Goin' On Here has an infectious hook and a blues rock 
feel. The harmonies are glorious and Blackmore is having a 
ball on lead guitar with the call and answer approach to the 
vocals, then ballroom piano follows.  This one is a real fun 
blast and remains a favourite obscurity. <p>Mistreated has been a favourite of mine since I've heard it 
live, powered by Coverdale and a blistering lead guitar solo. 
The slow bluesy feel is wonderful, and how this builds 
gradually with layers of guitars over Hughes brooding 
baseline has a genuine emotional resonance. The outro lead 
break is a belter, a blazing inferno of  speed picking. <p>"A" 200 closes the album with spacey keyboards and catchy 
melodies. The instrumental is captivating. <p>Overall, Burn is a blazing triumph and the band would keep 
the candle burning for the next year's albums with only a few 
burnouts along the way. </strong></strong></em></em>

If this was a straight rock review I would gladly give this cd four stars as it is an excellent 
rock 'n roll  album.  As a progressive rock album there is nothing progressive about it as it is 
pretty standard fare for the times it was released.  Nonetheless it does rock out and has

Woooh!!!!
What a blast! People often talks of In Rocks and Machine Head but Burn is maybe better 
than both!
The eponym first track is incredible, fast speed, keyboard enchantment.
I have to say that keyboards, hammonds are very well used on the albums with convincing 
solos.
A lot of hard roc

Ah...Burn...this is one of Deep Purple last good efforts. Musicianship is amazing on
this album, especially drumming by Paice. The big thing that got me on this album
was, excepting the first and last tracks, the general sound of this album is kind of
static and redundant. This is also one of the

Burn is not a prog rock album. Deep Purple is not a prog rock band. Hard Rock is the purple´s style of rock. Apart the early 3 albums, that was really prog influenced, the others only have some specific moments that remember us the 
tipic prog sound. One of this, is the Burn´s "A 200". An instrumen

The only track with prog-elements and also the only one that I could imagine to have 
appeared on an album by the Mark II  is 'Burn'. The other songs are also good  
(especially 'Sail away') but are pretty conventional taking a bluesy direction. Not a great 
Purple-album but the best of Mark III

I don't consider this album as prog rock, but it's great! This new line-up blended a funky 
sound to DEEP PURPLE traditional hard rock, resulting in gems like "You Fool No 
One", "Might Just Take Your Life" and "Lay Down Stay Down". Also, David Coverdale's 
voice fits perfectly on "Mistreated", o

Not much progressive here, but a really amazing interludes between Lord and Blackmore 
(specially in Burn). I love this album probably because was my first album of Pruple (and 
one of my fist albums).
