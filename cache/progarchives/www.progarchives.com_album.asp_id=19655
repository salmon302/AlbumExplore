This is my introduction to this very original and highly energetic band. Cynic, in a nutshell, are
what i would call a cross between Unexpect and The Mars Volta. The melodies, drumming and singing
remind me a lot of TMV's music, whilst the background growling and complexity remind me heavily of
Unexpect (who i don't like very much, however this band I can't get enough of). The scarce number of
short songs make the album come, and then go quite literally half an hour later. This is what i see
as good. Crisp, in and then out, not boring in the slightest, the very same way i feel about the
great Gentle Giant. However, the similarities this band have with others ends here: the music is
probably some of the most energetic neo-classical extreme metal i've ever heard, all the musicians
are very tightly together and the songs... well you cannot get any more interesting. They pile what
seems like 60 minutes of ideas into 30 minutes, quite the opposite of what bands like Sigur Ros and
Rosetta achieve. Coming from the extreme metal genre, you cannot expect an easy ride; it is just as
turbulent as the rest of the bands in the category. <p>That is all that can really be said, apart from i would have expected a longer album after so many
years of waiting, but anyways, it can't be helped. These guys are well rehearsed, write decent and
inventive music and are entirely original in their ideas, putting aside the apparent influences. The
length is a minor set back, and should only deter the shallowest of prog listeners. An excellent
album, 4 stars from me.</strong></strong></em></em>

So surprisingly for me I download an album from sub genre I've never listened before - ext/tech prog
metal.And that is the new album by Cynic - Traced in Air.At the beginning the sound was very strange
for me,but after five listenings I think this album is really of high quality.The songs show the
creativity by the musicians.There are no wear songs on this album.The sound is strong and contains
short-piece tunes,which I think are typical for this sub genre.My favourite song on the album is
The Space for This.It is really great song for me.Something that I don't like very much is the
track listing.I think it could be better,excluding the first and the last song,which made the
composition completed.I think this sub genre has a lot to offer in near future!</strong></strong></em></em>

Cynic - 'Traced in Air'
5 stars<p>A little rant:<p>When I first heard of Cynic a few years ago.they were long disbanded.  I enjoyed the album a hell of 
a lot, and realized the band's 'Focus' album was one of the biggest landmarks in metal.  I found it to be 
a completely remarkable record, but just patchy in some areas.  After the reunion tour was announced 
I was excited..but to here news of a new album, I was not.  Whenever a band gets back together after 
an overdue hiatus, their new album is terrible, just about every time.  When I first heard the album, I 
couldn't believe what I was hearing, the sound of this record is something I have never heard before, 
even after all these years the band had something new to bring to the table, and most of this material 
was written around 1993-1994.  The hardest part of listening to this album was knowing the previous 
one 'Focus' and how innovative that album was.  This band put that album in the past and now I do too.<p>The sound of the band on this album is incredible and has one of the best production values.  The 
album is loaded with some background effects and samples, above that is soaring guitar melodies and 
the intense drumming of Sean Reinhard and pompous bass work of Sean Malone.  The biggest change 
is the biggest complaint, the vocals. After all these years, Paul Masividal can SING!  He can hit plenty of 
high notes, sound real emotional and without the vocoder!  The death growls are so unbelievably 
miniscule that they are sparse throughout the entire album and buried so deep that one can just not 
hear them.  The band ditches a dissonant for a more melodic approach.  Now that the music is easier to 
bear on the listener, the vocals are also more tuned and appealing.  This album tells a story, the music 
intertwines and connects after a few listens. There is really no way for me to put this album down in 
any way.  A perfect score is well deserved here.  This album also accounts for the best opening and 
closing of all time.<p>Now I question myself and my low expectation for this album:<p>With the interesting post-Cynic Portal project, Sean Malone's solo project and his Gordian Knot project, 
which displayed excellent technical prowess and tight complex compositional work, Paul Masividal's and 
Sein Reinhard's expanding taste with the ethereal art-pop project Aeon Spoke and jazz-metal band 
Aghora..<p>.should I really even have been surprised?<p>Album of the year, by a disgusting margin.

I took a gamble with this one and was rewarded entirely-- Traced in Air is a jigsaw puzzle of complex 
instrumental work and songwriting, very satisfying during both its numerous aggressive and atmospheric 
passages.  <p>The biggest thing this album has going for it is its musicianship-- which is first rate.  Each member of the 
band is like a mathematician with their instrument, calibrating some sort of high-tech device with their 
playing.  That being said-- they aren't robots; there is a classy feeling of moodiness and a sort of brooding 
sarcasm behind their playing, which is really cool.  For a band centered around instrumental dexterity, 
there is also a high level of restraint here as well.  The group doesn't share the spot-light because there 
isn't one-- no one steals the show, which means that this music is not for the casual ear waiting for a 
melodic guitar solo.  <p>Although unmistakably metal, it is hardly extreme of overbearing.  Vocals are an interesting combination 
of a subdued, but aggressive growl and a highly produced alto/falsetto.  The lyrics are interesting, but are 
usually lost in the complexity of the songs, which means that each singer ends up becoming more of an 
instrument than a traditional <em>voice</em>-- this isn't sing-a-long music!  Expect nothing but cosmic 
density!<p>For fans of instrumental music this is pretty much the total package; I have few complaints.  Worthy of 
any metal fans attention, but especially those who enjoy talent more than soaring vocals.<p>Songwriting: 4

Most metal bands, or even bands in general, that take an almost 15 year hiatus before coming back
together to make a new album usually make one of inferior quality. That's what I had been afraid of
when I heard Cynic got back together. I thought that there wasn't any way that they could hope to
top the mind-blowing Focus, especially after such a long period of time. I was completely and 110%
wrong. In fact, it proved me so wrong that this has gradually become my pick for album of the year
in 2008. This is an album that I find myself coming back to three, four, five, and sometimes even
more times every week, often multiple times in a day. <p>This album may not seem like a big deal to most proggers, especially since it only clocks in just
over 34 minutes. However I think the length for this type of album is just right. It's a great mix
of psychedelic-infused jazz fusion in a death metal setting with a touch of avant-garde. The vocals
are about a 70-30 mix of clean singing and death growls respectively, which is definitely a good mix
for this type of music. This is definitely a unique experience in metal. Like I said, while many of
the songs are shorter, I think it helps to hold the listener's attention and feels more like the
band was trying to cram 60 minutes worth of ideas into these songs. They are very, very complex
jazz-fusion inspired death metal. Although while I think Focus concentrated more on the death metal
and jazz aspects, this album focuses more on the psychedelic aspects of their music. Masvidal's
lyrics still remain oddly soothing and beautiful, and at times almost like they were
computer-generated. Kruidenier has excellent death growls which are used to great effect, even if at
times it's fairly minimal. And Cynic also has one of the most accomplished rhythm sections in metal
as far as I'm concerned in Malone and Reinert, even to the point where I'll sometimes go through
this album just to listen to what the drums and bass are doing. The highlights for me are really
tough picks, but in the end, the trio of The Space for This (with a nice spacey intro), Evolutionary
Sleeper, and Integral Birth blows me away every time I listen to them.<p>	If you enjoy metal, jazz fusion, psychedelic, or instrumental music and want something modern,
complex, and wholly unique, then this should fit your tastes very well. Granted, it may take time to
grow on some people in comparison to others, but it's an extremely enjoyable listen. 5 stars, and
hopefully Cynic will write another album as good as this one...in less than 15 years from now.</strong></strong></em></em>

A Unique, Essential Piece of Space-Jazz-Technical-Prog Metal<p>While I will describe the sound of this brilliant band, this is a work that truly must be heard to believe. 
No other band sounds like this, and the elements combine so well that I have no problem saying that 
Traced in Air is a masterpiece of progressive Metal. If someone asked for 5 albums to describe the 
genre, this would be one of my picks.<p>The most obvious sonic feature of this band is the vocoder / computer / robot vocals. At first, this 
seems like a gimmick, but it actually fits the nature of the music and the lyric themes quite well. The 
degree of effect varies between sections, though I don't think there are any completely clean vocals, 
and it is often backed by a dragonvoice vocal and the combination is surprisingly effective. Over the 
course of the album, there are actually quite a variety of different vocal tonalities used, and they all 
work well.<p>The second, though less singular, feature of this band is the use of double-note palm muting arpeggios 
as the primary rhythm guitar form. That guitar speak is a technical description of the continuous 
chugging on the low strings that, combined with the very busy drumming, form the rhythmic basis of 
the music. Cynic uses this technique extensively, and the feel is at once loose, on top of the beat, but 
very technical and precise. Always, this feels like live humans playing off each other, never like a 
computer-corrected, click-track governed sterile sound that is common to the genre.<p>The album also features a fair bit of clean jazz chording which is extremely tasty and offsets the heavy 
distortion well. The guitar soloing is fluid, seemingly effortless despite some nice chops in places. All of 
this evokes sonic images that like the cover artwork are complexly colorful. This is a rich music, you 
can feel the musicians pouring their energy into the work, and unlike most death metal, the emotion 
they inject is not hate or anger. I feel love, fascination, fear, wonder, suffering, hope, sadness, and 
strength within this music, though never naked aggression.<p>What holds this all together is a great sense of melody. When the storm dies down and the refrain of 
Evolutionary Sleeper is sung in all its computer assisted glory, what hits home is the melody, one of the 
most basic of musical elements. This is what will bring back non-metalheads, even musical snobs who 
might not even venture often in rock to say: Now that's some creative music. The band has the wisdom 
to keep the album short, so the listener is left satisfied.<p>If metal has masterpieces, this is one of them. Essential for those who care about the current state of 
progressive music.<p>***Late 2009 note - this album has grown in appreciation for me to the point to think that it may be among the best prog metal albums ever made. Beautiful, deep, magical, amazing.<p></strong></strong></em></em>

14 years between albums is a long time. I'm so glad that they decided to do this though. Their debut was hugely influential but back when they created it they really felt out of place as there were no other bands like them. How times have changed. Reinert, Malone and Masvidal are back and we get a new (second) guitarist named Tymon who 
also adds some growls. The growls on the debut were too upfront for my 
taste, but here they have been reduced to being almost like backing vocals.The processed 
vocals on the debut have been replaced by Masvidal's normal singing voice which is another 
plus. Instrumentally this may not quite be as good as the debut but it's still amazing to say the 
least. I have to mention the album cover and the pictures in the liner notes. So well done. I like 
the lyrics too.<p>
"Nunc Fluens" builds until drums start to dominate. Great sound ! A really good intro track. "The 
Space For This" is pastoral with fragile vocals before it kicks in around 1 1/2 minutes. Nice. We 
get a mixture of growls and clean vocals to follow. Ripping guitar before 3 minutes. Incredible 
tune. "Evolutionary Sleeper" kicks in fairly quickly and check out Reinert ! Vocals join in as the 
contrasts of heavy and more laid back continue. Amazing sound 2 minutes in. It just drifts along 
as the guitar solos tastefully. "Integral Birth" is heavy right out of the gate. It settles quickly 
though as vocals and drums start to lead the way. Heavy again as contrasts continue. Killer 
track ! <p>"The Unknown Guest" builds and the drums sound fantastic in this one. Vocals before a 
minute. A mixture of clean and growls here. Some atmosphere 2 1/2 minutes in but the guitar 
comes ripping in to change that. "Adam's Murmur" continues with the contrasts both vocally 
and instrumentally. Another excellent song. "King Of Those Who Know" is pastoral with some 
guest female vocals early. It kicks in heavily and we get those contrasting vocals followed by 
some blistering guitar before 2 1/2 minutes.The guitar sounds so good 4 1/2 minutes 
in. "Nunc Stans" builds as drums pound away and guitar synths come in. Reserved vocals 
come in as it settles.<p>
Easily 4 stars. Great album.

|C+| A great revival for Cynic.<p>It's easy to be suspicious of bands that get back together after a long period of being disbanded,
for as others have pointed out, the output is almost always dreadful. But with Traced in Air we do
in fact have a quality release from a band that has been disbanded for around decade and a half,
then out of the blue reunites, produces an album, and even goes on tour for it. I wouldn't be all
too surprised if this album has become so popular just because it far surpassed most peoples'
expectations.<p>For anyone who doesn't already know, Cynic is a band that blends speedy death metal with fusion, the
heavier parts being the former and the softer parts having qualities of the latter. They use many
effects in their music in many ways, especially with the vocals and guitars. Their debut album Focus
is considered by many extreme metal fans, especially  on the artistic side, to be a staple of more
intellectualized death metal, up to par with later Death and Atheist. The musicians certainly hold
nothing back in showing off their musicianship, and not for the sake of itself, but for the sake of
creating great music, which itself makes me have great respect for this band overall.<p>Also let it be noted that my rating comes more from my personal taste regarding the album.
Objectively, this is a highly polished album, very few if any awkward spots, and well thought out
writing and production overall. The best track is by far the second one, The Space for This, which
in my mind is an instant classic of extreme metal. The other tracks, however, were not nearly as
thrilling for me, though each had come very good sections. Had they all been as great as that second
track, this album would be a hands down masterpiece. And after listening to this album many times
the last few weeks, I don't thing they'll grow on me anytime soon.<p>This album is quite comparable to the band's debut. Here we have more use of clean vocals; the
guttural vocals almost serve as more of a backing vocal line, rarely having any featured time. This
aspect I prefer over that of Focus' somewhat below par sounding guttural vocals. What makes me
slightly prefer their debut overall is how the music here has less textural variation than Focus, or
at least from track to track. They overall sound all too similar to me, and I don't personally find
the material as interesting overall, though I do appreciate everything that's done with the writing
in logical terms.<p>I can see why many people are excited about this release considering the circumstances with the band
and the progression in their sound. I find it an entertaining album but nothing to really write home
about or listen to often enough to learn every note. If you're interested in what's happening right
now with progressive extreme metal scene, or if you loved Cynic's debut and want to hear where the
band has headed with their music after quite some time, this might be an album for you to check out.
It'll be very interesting to hear what their next album will sound like.</strong></strong></em></em>

This album came and went pretty much unnoticed. But being a fan of both the Tech Metal genre and
Cynic's debut album I was eager to hear if Cynic's comeback would be comparable to the "<em>new
wave</em>" of Tech Metal that has been sweeping me off my feet for the last couple of years. I'm
talking about young bands like for example Between The Buried And Me and Canadian Protest The Hero. After a few spins it's safe to say that Cynic's sound is nothing like the new Tech Metal. The band has more of a Space Metal approach (combination of Space Rock and some Tech Metal) which was an interesting combination at first but I felt that all the technical riffs were muted down for the sake of the overall flow, which is in my opinion a real pity since I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more. Even during the most outrageous guitar-driven moments there is always some mellow atmospheric sound that keeps it all from not sounding as exciting as the guitar work would suggest.<p>
This album just never clicked with me the way <em>Focus</em> did so I rarely listen to it although it's, by no means, a bad release. There's just so many different combinations that have been applied to the Tech Metal music in the last couple of years and couple of them do in fact bring something new to the table (Opeth, Unexpect) while others tend to sound like the continuation of the experiments that were conducted by Atheist, Death and Voivod in the early heydays. This one unfortunately fits into the latter category for me.<p>**** star songs: Nunc Fluens (2:56) The Space For This (5:46) Evolutionary Sleeper (3:35) Adam's
Murmur (3:29) King Of Those Who Know (6:09)<p>*** star songs: Integral Birth (3:53) The Unknown Guest (4:13) Nunc Stans (4:13)<p>Total rating: 3,64</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong> A wonderful piece of modern Prog Metal. </strong><p>Wow. I have to say, I didn't really know what to expect when I picked up this album from my local FYE. However, there was only 
one copy left, and I had heard plenty of good things about Cynic, so I took a risk and bought the album prior to hearing any 
Cynical material. One of the best musical decisions I have ever made.<p>When I first listened to <em>Traced In Air</em>, I actually didn't care much for it. I'm not sure what I was wanting it to sound like 
instead, but the incredible originality of this music at first caused me not to enjoy it. Not because it was original, of course, but because it was so different from any other album in the genre. So, it was only until many months later when I 
decided to force myself to sit down and listen to the whole thing from start to finish that I finally understood what all the fuss was 
about. This truly is incredible.<p>My three favorite songs would have to be ''The Space For This'', ''Evolutionary Sleeper'' and ''Adam's Murmur'', though every single 
track on this record is brilliant. It has no weal point. Odd, really, since like I said I didn't understand why people dug it so much 
initially. Just goes to show that returning to music you may not have enjoyed on the first go 'round is highly beneficial, and almost 
insisted, especially with this genre of music.<p>So what makes it Progressive? Well, since it's Metal, I can understand this question being asked, but when compared to the rest 
of the generic Metal music that is out today, the originality of <em>Traced In Air</em> becomes clear. Instead of single note, palm-
muted strumming constantly, the rhythm guitar duties are occupied just as much by Jazz chords, old-school Prog-Rock 
progressions and long periods of moody silence. In most typical Metal music being made right now, it seems the guitars are 
always present, and always playing in the same style. To the point when they begin to crowd the rest of the music. Not with Cynic. 
These guys have a very eclectic musical taste, and it shows very prominently. <p>Another feature commonly associated with super heavy music of this type would be the cookie monster-style growling vocal. 
Again, there is a nice mixture of high, soft and melodic singing along with what you would expect. So rather than dancing to only 
one tune, there are several directions these guys go in, and they do it quite frequently. This makes the music much easier to 
digest, and not nearly as overly-brutal or in-your-face as other Metal acts may be to some people. I strongly recommend this gem 
of modern Jazz-Metal (because that's what it is!) to anybody with an open-minded attitude about Metal. If you've been trying to get 
into this side of the music spectrum, but still haven't found the right outlet, this may very well be the record for you. Melodic, heavy, 
dark and beautiful, Cynic's <em>Traced In Air</em> is a wonderful contradiction of sound and attitude. All of these varied moods 
seamlessly flow together, and make this album a very worthy purchase for anybody willing to take a little walk into unusual heavy 
territory. <p>Happy Listening. </strong></strong></em></em>

Cynic is a band with a very distinctive sound, blending progressive death metal with jazzy 
passages, highly complicated song structures and pretty unusual vocals. Fourteen years after 
their first studio release, Focus, Cynic decided to return with this album: an astonishingly 
technical release that leaves me ultimately cold.<p>Despite this, i can still name a lot of the album that I do like. The band proves to be one of a 
kind with their distinctive style. Very notable are the vocals, which vary from fierce growls to the 
futuristic, robotic sounding vocals. Also, the musicianship is nothing less than excellent. Highly 
technical song structures with riffs and passages that go everywhere. That sounds good, but I'd 
also like to point out that things feel overly dynamic. The album is a constanty exploding, and 
therefore lacking a constant flow. This is excactly why I find the album to be somewhat tiresome 
(and therefore uninteresting) and feel it tends to drag.<p>Somewhat enjoyable, but in the end tiresome, those are my main thoughts on this album. If 
you're looking for some highly technical extreme metal, you might enjoy this. If you want the 
album to have a nice flow rather than being 34 minutes of non-stop climatic moments, you 
might like this album much less. Anyway, despite my negative words, I don't find Traced In Air 
to be a really bad release, it just fails to enjoy me as much as some other music does. </strong></strong></em></em>

Well, when I first heard about this album I was quite excited. Also slightly worried what it would
be like after such a long gap. Well? It turns out both were correct. This album does have some
strong points, not to mention the technical and intricate music that we would've expected. However,
I was a bit disappointed with the album. I try my best not to compare albums, so I took some time
off, but after more listening I can say I am not comparing this album to "Focus". "Traced in Air" is
simply not that great. <p><p>Nunc Fluens. Frankly pretty boring. The guitar work is mainly just screechy noises, (though the
drumming over the middle part is pretty cool). The end is the only part I really enjoy. <p><p>The Space For This. Begins really mellow, but kicks in soonish. Has some nice layered vocals, with
clean over growls. While it sounds cool, it always does. I suppose what I'm saying is, a bit played
out in my book. The solo in the middle is pretty great. Lots of technicality and melodicism in the
song. <p><p>Evolutionary Sleeper. Same as above. <p><p>Integral Birth. Starts off cool, followed by a melodic part, some strange clean singing over growls,
repeat. <p><p>Staring to notice a pattern? Well, that may be because pretty quickly this album starts to taper
off. It's one of those dilemma's...if it is good music, then it's not bad if it all more or less is
the same? As is often the case with album's like that, every song on here is good. None are
standouts, and none are low points. So I will say this about "Traced in Air". It has some great
musicianship. Technical, complex and intricate guitar passages, great drumming that perfectly
matches the music. Honestly, the music is pretty brilliant. <p><p>However, here are some problems. The vocals are very difficult. Like with "Focus" they are not clean
vocals per se. They are still those robotic vocals. Not all the time, there is plenty of natural
singing but overall the clean vocals, (both of them) just sound awful. The sound of the guitar is
different. I was going to say strange but it's not, just different. With this release Cynic took a
step even farther away from death metal. In fact they took a step from metal in general. It's still
there though. They also seemed to have moved a bit from jazz, though it as well is still there.
Cynic appears to have moved in a truer progressive direction. This album has a very spacey feel to
it. Also, while I am not a stickler for production, (unless its terrible it has no sway on me) the
production here is one other issue. It is not bad, but strange. I'm sure its what they wanted, but I
have a tough time hearing all easily, sounds like a bit of a mess. <p><p>So, what to say about this spacey, jazz-metal album? It has the essential musicianship we'd expect
from Cynic, but is overall slow, and drags often. It was physically difficult for me to listen to.
Not great, not bad. The pros dont really outweigh the cons or vice versa. Therefore I give "Traced
in Air" <p><p>Three Stars </strong></strong></em></em>

Blown away by complexity, mesmerized by simplicity.<p>Traced in Air, Cynic's second debut after being formed 21 years prior, is a valorous effort 
after the impressive Focus debut. Fantastic instrumental pieces, that trippy vocoder sound, 
and just beautiful music all together, there is little doubt this album is 5(+) stars. 
Immediately after being added to my collection, it became one of my favorite prog metal 
album out of ALL of my albums (which are a lot).<p>Nunc Fluens is a nice and short little opener, with a building sensation that crescendos 
near the end into a fantastic instrumental section with subtle background vocals. Right of 
the bat 2 minutes in, I'm hooked.<p>The Space for This starts off slow with great melodic guitar, and Masvidal's "vocals" come 
in. Very progressive, very nice, very epic. Soon it breaks into what we love about Cynic: some 
jazz fusion epicness. The whole track is amazing, great lyrics, great guitar work, that epic 
bass, and amazing drums (I am a drummer, I tend to pay special attention to that!). <p>Evolutionary Sleeper is easily the best track on the album. Similar to the previous track, 
melodic guitar opens, then breaks into a slightly distorted sound with some amazing 
instrumentation. <p>Integral Birth is a slower song once you get into it, after the intro, and into the verses. The 
chorus is catchy, with a very nice sound going with the guitar. It is very similar to much of 
Misha Mansoor of Periphery's outside work with bands such as Haunted Shores, as well as 
the band Scale the Summit's guitar sound.<p>The Unknown Guest opens similarly as the rest, a great riff, then breaking into harder riffs 
and more jazzy-fusion-y sections. <p>Adam's Murmur opens with a vocal piece this time, but then opens into the traditional sound 
like the rest of the album. There's a melodic chorus, but other than that the track doesn't 
stick out like Evolutionary Sleeper.<p>Kings of Those Who Know is the longest track on the album (running just over 6 minutes), 
with a nice melodic guitar-synth sound and a chorus coming in early on. It is definitely one 
of the better tracks on the album. Fantastic transitions, fantastic instrumentation, fantastic 
everything!<p>Nunc Stans closes the album with slower melodies and riffs, but is still a fantastic track. <p>Overall, the album is fantastic. Vocoded vocals give Masvidal's vocals (if he has any) that 
nice touch of experimentalism and his creative guitar playing is a great sound. All the songs 
are catchy and have great instrumentation. The album is just fantastic. If you see a copy and 
do not own it, buy it immediately!

<strong> 'Traced In Air' - Cynic (10/10) </strong><p>Back in 1994, progressive metal band Cynic disbanded, leaving a string of demos and a 
debut which has since gone on to be considered a classic of the genre. Suffice to say, with 
the band members moving onto different projects, in seemed as if this band would go down 
in history as being a one-album wonder; the sort of act that metalheads could speculate 
over for years, wondering what other great albums could have come to fruition, had the band 
simply stayed together. A good twelve years pass, and it is announced finally that these 
pioneers of 'jazz metal' have decided to get back together, and another two after that before 
this, their second album would hit shelves worldwide. Although fans would have every right 
to worry whether or not the follow-up to their beloved 'Focus' would be worth the wait, Cynic's 
comeback effort 'Traced In Air' not only matches the intensity and intelligence of 'Focus', but 
rather triumphs over it, creating a record that would be otherwise perfect, were it not for its 
somewhat disappointing brevity.<p>Back are the technical riffs, ethereal atmospherics, jazz inflections and distinct 'robot' vocals 
that made 'Focus' such a unique organism back in the day. However, with plenty of time now 
for each musician to develop a more distinct sound for the band, 'Traced In Air' does feel 
like the album the band was meant to make. Technically vicious, progressive, and- 
surprisingly enough for a band labelled as death metal- some beautifully done melodies. 
Although there's no question while listening to any song on 'Traced' that it is well-fitting of 
the technical and progressive labels, project mastermind Paul Masvidal has a very melodic 
side to his music here that really props the act onto another level entirely. While each 
composition is tightly arranged and sharply delivered with solos, scales and all, there is the 
sense that beyond the metal madness are pieces of songwriting that could easily be 
transposed into heartfelt pop songs. Have no fear though; while the melodies are 
memorable and even 'catchy', there's nothing but complexity and depth to the 
instrumentation and arrangement of this album.<p>Something that is sure to be a divisive point among fans will continue to be Masvidal's 
signature harmonized vocorder vocal work. While comparisons have been made to that of a 
'robot' or even as far as being labelled as blatant auto-tune, Paul makes it clear in the more 
subdued moments of the record that his voice is emotive and sharp regardless of any 
technologies. The use of a harmonizer in his voicework stands as a creative decision, and 
considering the rather spacey feel of the album, it does work well. Although the band has 
been called 'death metal' quite often in part due to the band's intermittent use of growls in 
the past, it is mostly clean singing here, which is quite a bit better done than the somewhat 
sparse growls of Tymon Kruidenier on the album, which feel at times quite out of place in 
the album.<p>In terms of musicianship, there's no surprise here; great performances from these legends, 
as well as some incredible guitar riffs and solos. Sean Reinert's drumwork does not feel as 
if it is done a complete justice however; some of Reinert's best moments here are during 
the jazzier sections, but it is a bit difficult to make out the details sometimes under the 
constant psychedelic effects and guitar-driven nature of the album.<p>A highly philosophic and intelligent metal album that could even be said to weave its way 
into the spiritual realm, there is no doubt that 'Traced In Air' is among the best metal albums 
released in its decade, although it will certainly be panned by the most 'true' metalheads 
wanting nothing more from this band than growls and 'evil' riffs. The only thing that keeps 
the album from being truly perfect is that it always ends far sooner than I would like it to. At 
only over the half hour mark, it almost always feels like a journey that could have done with 
at least another ten minutes of the same quality added onto it, considering the fourteen year 
wait. However, brief as it may be, Cynic has released another classic with 'Traced In Air'; this 
will be an album that will be listened to by metalheads decades from now, mark my words.</strong></strong></em></em>

The follow-up (14 years later!) to the ground-breaking, ear-defying 1994 classic, Focus, shows a mellower though technically and sonically still-amazing group of more-melodic metal extremists. <p>Beginning with the opener, Nunc Fluens" (2:57) (9/10) the band makes it clear that it has pregressed but that it is still heavy metal. 2. The Space for This" (5:47) (8/10) starts off so mellowly that I thought it was a pop song that my daughter likes to dance to (an Adele song, I believe). But, by 1:30 it has kicked into Cynic-drive--even including a few growls. Still there is this kind of melodic, less-edgy feel to their new album. Fully half of the eight songs here begin and carry throughout a softer side.<p>Favorite pieces: "King of Those Who Know" (6:09) (9/10) and the albums two "Nunc" bookends. Except for "Adam's Murmur" (6/10), the rest are all solid 7 or 8s.</strong></strong></em></em>

The first time I spun this album I was confused about the music as it was so complex for me 
at the beginning. As I was so curious about Sean Malone's technical capabilities with his 
chapman stick, I kept spinning it many times and it surprisingly grew on me. One thing I can 
say about this album is that the whole album sounds like a one track to me as many times I 
realized when I tried to re-spin I was not aware that the music listening session reached to 
track 5 without I really noticed when the transition between one song to another. It's quite 
well understood as the music this album offers is basically containing many changes in 
nuances from complex music arrangements that sometime changes dramatically into silent 
parts.<p>The album contains many textures and soundscapes like demonstrated from the opening 
track Nunc Fluens (2:56) where the intro part indicates atmospheric session followed with 
floating drumwork. It's really a great opening. It a short track but it sets the whole nuance of 
the album. The transistion to next track does not sound noticeable as the first track suddenly 
stop followed with guitar fills that opens up second track The Space For This (5:46) where 
the nuance changes differently from previous track. This second track is really excellent. I 
like the drumming work and the combined clean and growling vocals augmented with 
stunning guitar work. I think this kind of music is something that I never heard, it's so unique. 
The guitar solo is so stunning!<p>Evolutionary Sleeper (3:35) also starts with guitar fills and I do not notice that it changes to 
another track. The music is similar with previous track but it does not make me boring. There 
are great stops as the music flows. For some reason it reminds me to Mars Volta sorts of 
music / style. The other remaining tracks are excellent - all of them: Integral Birth (3:53) -- I 
like the drumming part; The Unknown Guest (4:13); Adam's Murmur (3:29); King Of Those 
Who Know (6:09); and Nunc Stans (4:13).<p>I think this album is really an excellent music offering from Cynic even though the album is 
short in duration. But the music is truly great! It's different than the other kind of music with 
metal elements. Keep on proggin' ...!<p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>

Cynic's Traced in Air is a quick, stimulating blast of intelligent and intelligible technical metal.
 Most of the music is a labyrinth of cacophonic yet orderly passages.  The electric guitar tones
remain tasteful throughout, while the bass and drummer are in synch and amazingly constricted in
their executions of complex musical transitions.  The growling serves as a supplemental vocal that
fills out the sound rather than assuming center stage.  Further enhancing the sound is a liberal use
of electronic effects and tones, particularly on the lead vocals.  I believe this is an excellent
album for the uninitiated with respect to technical progressive metal- but be warned: Even just
getting one's feet wet will mean getting soaked occasionally.<p>"Nunc Fluens"  The intensity of the album builds in a piercing stream of noise and percussion.  Just
as the barrage of sound takes shape, it inexplicably tapers off.<p>"The Space for This"  Gentle, clean electric guitar and soft, pensive vocals become a far more
intense but melodic experience.  While not exactly jazz, the music is smooth and yet retains a
mechanical feel.  Soon, however, the music returns to a technical heavy metal reminiscent to me of
Celldweller, particularly with respect to the layered vocals.  I consider this one of the greatest
songs in the Tech/Extreme Metal category.<p>"Evolutionary Sleeper"  A rhythmic workout, "Evolutionary Sleeper" contains various tempos and
textures, all featuring high-pitched vocals with a lower octave (again, similar to Celldweller or
The Mars Volta).  The lead guitar has a pleasant tone and is an impressive highlight, suggestive of
Douglas Ott.<p>"Integral Birth"  Rife with further discharges of speedy progressive metal, the fourth track is kept
interesting with abrupt shifts in mood and tone, although overall it remains a fairly consistent
dark metal song, laden with growls and walls of guitar.<p>"The Unknown Guest"  This song is one of most exciting in terms of lead guitar passages.  The washes
of growls serve as a pleasant contrast to the high-pitched vocals.  The piece remains rhythmically
engaging with excellent drumming.<p>"Adam's Murmur"  Returning to quieter moods, the beginning of this piece is sporadically interrupted
by blasts of heavy metal phrases.  The electric guitar solo is fluid, while the drummer tightly
holds the musical twists together with incredible precision.<p>"King of Those Who Know"  Initially soft, Cynic's longest track on this album (at only just over six
minutes) is in my opinion the low point of an otherwise stellar album.  The bass guitar may outshine
the other instruments here, but the composition is simply too convoluted.  Whereas the music was
tight and navigable, "Kings of Those Who Know" launches itself in seemingly every direction at once.
 The jazz guitar conclusion is lovely.<p>"Nunc Stans"  The denouement of this trippy tech meal excursion is laidback and more psychedelic.

The technical, experimental metal subgenres have come a long way since Cynic's debut 
album, and the band may have been dormant for well over a decade before reforming, but if 
Traced In Air feels like it's lagging a little bit behind the cutting edge, it's only half a step behind. 
Once again, as on Focus, Cynic prove themselves to be masters of blending death metal 
riffage and masterful technical intricacies, and even if the sort of technical death metal they, 
Atheist, and Death pioneered back in the day isn't quite so shocking and avant-garde any more, 
it's still a hell of a lot of fun to listen to.</strong></strong></em></em>

<em>"Traced in Air"</em> is the 2nd full-length studio album by US progressive metal act 
<B>Cynic</B>. The album was released through <B>Season of Mist</B> in November 
2008. <B>Cynic</B> were quite a prominent name on the progressive part of the early 
nineties US death metal scene and they released one of the seminal albums on that scene 
in <em>"Focus (1993)"</em>. They had released no less than four demos from 1988 - 1991 
though and various members of the band had also worked as session musicians on 
albums by artists such as <B>Atheist</B>, <B>Pestilence</B>, <B>Master</B> and 
<B>Death</B> before the release of <em>"Focus (1993)"</em>. They toured shortly to support 
the release of their debut album, but then disbanded to concentrate on other projects. So 
<em>"Traced in Air"</em> is a genuine comeback album 15 years down the line. The lineup has 
seen one change as guitarist <B>Jason Gobel</B> has been replaced by Dutch guitarist 
<B>Tymon Kruidenier</B>, who also delivers the sparse growling vocals on the album.<p><em>"Traced in Air"</em> is a compact album featuring 8 tracks distributed over a 34:16 
minutes long playing time. Not completely unlike the format of <em>"Focus (1993)"</em>. The 
music style and overall sound has changed quite a bit since the debut though. The high 
pitched growling vocals are more subdued this time around (and predominantly appear 
low in the mix) and mostly appear as backing to the clean vocals and as a consequence 
the death metal tag that the band were given in the early nineties isn´t that valid anymore. 
While the technical level of playing is certainly high (and still features jazz and fusion traits) 
and the tracks challenging in structure and dynamics, there is a tranquil/spiritual 
atmosphere about <em>"Traced in Air"</em>, that is even more pronounced than it was on 
<em>"Focus (1993)"</em>.<p>The album features one brilliant track after another. Tracks like <em>"The Space for This"</em>, 
<em>"Evolutionary Sleeper"</em> and <em>"King of Those Who Know"</em> are breathtaking to say 
the least. The only track I find is slightly sub par to the rest is <em>"The Unknown Guest"</em>, 
but we´re still talking a high quality progressive metal track, so it´s a minor issue, that more 
than anything else probably comes down to personal taste.<p>The music is multi-layered and quite difficult to grasp upon initial listen, but fortunately the 
sound production is detailed and well sounding, which helps to easier understanding the 
music upon repeated listens. So <em>"Traced in Air"</em> is an album that wins on all 
perimeters and if you view the album in an overall perspective it´s not only a unique 
sounding release in <B>Cynic´s</B> discography but also a unique sounding album in 
music in general. A rare a achivement that fully deserves a 5 star (100%) rating.</strong></strong></em></em>

There are just some bands who absolutely love to cross the boundaries of musical prowess or creativity, whether a record's revolutionary or just plain amazing. Cynic, Death, and Atheist were a bit of a "Big Three" of progressive death back in the early 90's, but why? Why would they be there, other than being early? Many reasons could come up, but those 3 simply had more creativity and talent at the time. Most technical metal bands today rely heavily on overly clean recording techniques and lots (and I mean lots) of sweep picking and shredding. They almost lost that sort of experimental edge of the early days.<p>The thing is, Cynic's first release, Focus, embodied that aforementioned experimental edge perfectly and struck a balance between the baffling and the rewarding. So many progheads were astounded at the level of technicality and emotion that went into the record, as well as individual prowess. Plus, the other thing that Cynic (along with Atheist) had that most others don't is the extremely high level of jazz fusion put into the album. The record simply did not disappoint, and it brought in newcomers of progressive music, as well as metal, and remains a legend to this day.<p>Traced in Air is a bit of a successor, but more of spiritual successor than an actual sequel to the original. Released 15+ years after the original, hype was high, but Cynic knew how to cater to (most) fans while bringing in new ones as well. Cynic knew not to make an easy cash-in, especially after 15 years, as fans would become ridiculously enraged at such a sight after so much anticipation. So what did Cynic do for Traced in Air?<p>They topped the original.<p>One thing that received mixed opinions was the level of accessibility this album has, and it is indeed more accessible to listen to. However, that doesn't detract from such an experience as this. The instrumentalists are still top-notch, as is their quality. Paul Masvidal's odd robotic vocals have been swapped for better, more regular vocals. The growls are cleaner as well, and drums are as technical as ever. Now think of that, and, on top of that, cleaner production. You basically get a recipe for success.<p>The influences on this album are more diverse as well. You'll get some King Crimson here and there, a bit of Rush, some Porcupine Tree, and so on. Cynic spreads these influences out and put in their own signature sound, creating something truly unique and never seen before in progressive metal. <p>Of course then, you'd need a strong opening, right? Well, the beginning is MUCH different from the one seen previously in Veil of Maya. That one bursts out of the gate, while Nunc Fluens offers more of a traditional prog intro, but has unique synth effects and tribal drumming. The track is somewhat mesmerizing and offers an excellent introduction to the album.<p>The following songs contain a phenomenal amount of quality, as well as new crazy twists and turns. "The Space for This" has such a dreamy intro with the vocals aiding to that effect, before it builds into an epic riff going to the verse. The same structure goes for "King of Those who Know," one of the highlights of the record. It has female-type vocals to begin, and builds up to an amazing verse.<p>"Evolutionary Sleeper" is unique all its own, and features some of Paul Masvidal's best vocals as it clocks in at 3:34, one of the shortest tracks. More power to it, as the concise feel of the song is very tight in instrumentation and production. The growls are also featured here, as well as in other places. The chorus is quite dreamy, and then a jazzy solo ends the song. Great stuff.<p>Now's time to talk about individual talents. First of, it seems that Paul Masvidal has improved tenfold on this album, and it shows. The vocals are a huge plus here, especially on "Integral Birth," which has a bit more of an accessible feel to it. Gone are the weird robotic effects, and now semi-normal vocals take place with the assistance of a digitized "octave voice." His guitar solos are now more concise as well, and still very excellent.<p>Sean Reinart just destroys the drums here, showing his best performance yet. On "The Space for This," his technical drumming permeates the whole ordeal, while never being too overbearing. He has such a unique and fresh drumming style. The other members keep up as well, too, providing a nice pace for Masvidal and Reinart to shine.<p>Overall, this album is an odd entity, and one that is truly mind-blowing. Any fan of progressive metal/rock should not miss this, and it's taken a lot more as an experience.<p>(Originally published on Sputnikmusic)</strong></strong></em></em>

It's hard to convey some two decades into the 21st century what a big deal CYNIC's landmark album
"Focus" was back in 1993 when it single-handedly shattered the playbook of death metal and took the
fledgling genre into the world of jazz and electroncia. Part Morbid Angel, part Mahavishnu Orchestra
and part Massive Attack, this Miami based band basically launched a whole new strain of what would
be coined jazz-metal and then called it quits. The consequences of "Focus" being thrown into the
limelight of underground extreme metalheads was that it upped the bar several notches in the
proficiency department and while band's like Death and Atheist were in the fusion game as well,
CYNIC took progressive metal into a completely different dimension with "Focus" which remains a high
mark to which technical metal music wizards still strive to emulate.<p>Despite dropping one of metal's most revered albums onto on unsuspecting world, CYNIC quickly
disbanded as they were working on a second studio album due to musical and personal differences.
Jason Gobel (guitars), Paul Masvidal (guitars, vocals) and Sean Reinert (drums) continued together
and formed a short-lived band called Portal (before the Australian band of the same name came
around), bassist Sean Malone formed the fusion-metal band Gordian Knot and then Reinert and Masvidal
formed yet another band called Aeon Spoke which was more of a pop album centered around an acoustic
emo style. The former members of CYNIC happily went their own ways for almost 15 years but some of
the members were starting to feel that they had unfinished business to take care of in the world of
CYNIC and in 2006 Paul Masvidal announced that CYNIC would reunite to play at various metal and rock
festivals. With no new album the band played songs from "Focus" the band Portal as well as a few
covers and the new song "Evolutionary Sleeper."<p>The new band minus Gobel decided the time was right to resurrect CYNIC and finish the material
started for a sophomore album that never made it the first time around. With new guitarist Tymon
Kruidenier, CYNIC finally released its second album TRACED IN AIR in 2008,
fifteen long years after "Focus." While expectations were cast upon that debut masterpiece as a
reference point as to where the band might develop its new sounds, the fact that there was a 15 year
delay and several other band experiences in between meant that TRACED IN AIR was more like the sum
of all that came before and as the title indicates is more focused on an AIR-y feel as opposed to a
knock your socks off death metal extravaganza. While still steeped in massive molten metal guitar
antics, TRACED IN AIR was more of a light technical display of jazzy chord progression displayed in
echoey arpeggios that set the tone for the eruptive heavier elements to follow and not the other way
around. There were less dueling twin guitar leads and more focus to layering effects of polyrhythms
and guitar tones.<p>From the chaotic swirls of "Nunc Fluens" that sound like the band acting as a receiver channeling
the ethers to like a radio station, the rhythmic chaos slowly coalesces into the jazzed up guitar
riffs that reassure that the band was still in the metal camp however brief they may be before the
unadulterated jazz guitar intro of "The Space For This" sets an overall tone for TRACED IN AIR as
Masavidal delivers his tender clean vocals in a subdued passionate plea, a style that he implements
throughout the album that only harkens back to "Focus" with Kruidenier's growly vocal accompaniments
limited to backing supplement contrasting effects. The beauty of TRACED IN AIR is how it
effortlessly transmogrifies from placid spaced out jazz guitar runs to blistering jazzy fusion metal
with Reinert's drumming virtuosity often taking center stage. As with focus, a feminine vocal
counterpoint finds its way into key moments as to soften the raging rampages of the metal aspects as
Amy Correia takes the place of SAonia Otey.<p>While "Focus" was fairly scattered, TRACED IN AIR is actually the more "focused" album of the two as
the album displays a perfect mix of disparate elements which finds each track running into the next
and the softness and bombastic playing together like well behaved children at a Christmas play. It's
clear that the chemistry was on fire once again and CYNIC crated an unbelievable successful comeback
with this menagerie of technically infused jazz-metal that while not as revolutionary as the band's
first album was unbelievably relevant for the time of its release. Gone are the vocoder effects and
thus this album is less alienating and more intimate but the bursts of angularity are steered into
jazzy harmonies and melodies that keep the entire album feeling unified. This is one that may
disappoint upon the first listen if you have already gone gaga over "Focus" but as i've listened to
this many times over the years, it's one that grows on you in a completely different way. Drop the
comparisons and meditate on TRACED IN AIR on its own terms and it quickly becomes clear that this is
a flawless album that delivers another magic moment in the world of progressive metal and the
production is flawless.</strong></strong></em></em>

I've never been into Cynic much, until they reformed last year and they released a new album. The

I popped this into my CD player, expecting to hear something boring and aged in the bad way. How
many bands come back 10 or more years later and disappoint people greatly. Traced in Air is a
great return album for the band Cynic, whose last album Focus was considered a masterpiece by many

Ive been a fan of Cynics Focus for years, and I couldn't believe this was true: a new alum from the
legendary and cult band. The outcome? Well, its all very logical really, if you take into account
what the members have been doing since the first album. The rhythm base, with both Malone and

Cynic has returned after fifteen years of absence to show us that they will continue what they have
started with a new album called Traced in Air.

The fifteen years of their absence really pays off when you hear this new album. Not only is the
basic overall sound of the record similar to their
