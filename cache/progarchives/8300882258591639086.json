  "biography": "Khan biography\n\nFormed in London, UK, in 1971 - Disbanded in 1972\n\nKHAN's bio reads like a who's who of former and future celebs from\n\nEGG\n\n,\n\nGONG\n\n,\n\nHATFIELD AND THE NORTH\n\nand\n\nNATIONAL HEALTH\n\n. The initial line-up of this early 70's Canterbury outfit consisted of keyboard player Dave Stewart, guitarist\n\nSteve HILLAGE\n\n, bassist Nick Greenwood and drummer\n\nPip PYLE\n\n. Before recording their one and only album, Pyle moved on to GONG and was replaced by Eric Peachy (ex-DR. K's BLUES BAND). The group disbanded after the release of the album in 1972.\n\n\"Space Shanty\" is made up of six ambitious tracks composed almost entirely by Hillage. All four musicians are in fine form but the album is particularly dominated by Hillage's spacey/bluesy guitar and Stewart's effervescent Hammond play. Although much of the material is based on a repetitive verse/chorus/verse cycle and has recurrent musical themes, the band frequently breaks out into extended instrumental freak outs, either soloing or engaging in formidable guitar/organ interplay. This album is a fine sample of early Canterbury/bluesy space rock.\n\nA must-have for Canterbury fans, and not merely for its historical value.\n\n: : : Lise (HIBOU), CANADA : : :\n\nNote an album called \"Who never rests\" by Khan has no connection with this band.",
