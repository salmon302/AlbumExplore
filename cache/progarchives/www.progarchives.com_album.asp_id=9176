The first Deep Purple's album I ever bought, many years ago. Why I've chosen then to 
pick up Strombringer? I remember it was mainly for the cover: an intrepid Pegasus 
(winged horse) who's flying between thunder and tornad. Did he represent the delicate 
equilibrium Purple had just reach with the entering of Coverdale? Maybe. What I was 
sure by looking at the nice painting was that music would have been in an "american 
mood" due to the environment of the great US' plains. And I was right. The feeling was 
after confirmed when I listened entirely for the first time to the magnum opus "In 
Rock" which is undoubtetly the most coherent and solid mature work from them.<p>By the way, after many listenings I am now a little bit disappointed for almost all the 
tracks, the opener apart! In fact I do like very much the Stormbringer track with all 
those wonderful keyboards and synths by the master hands of John Lord. Why the rest 
of the album is completely different? 
I'll explain things better: songs aren't bad, songs have that "funk" influence I don't 
know if it was carried on by Coverdale or not...people seem to confirm it, though! 
The only track I enjoy to listen frequently, the opener apart, is Holy Man.
What I could say more? Two albums are for me: In Rock and Fireball, the next works are 
more conventionally drafted! <p>2.50...should I have to round it up to three? </strong></strong></em></em>

Though I find "Stormbringer" to be quite a pleasant listen, it is far from being the 
masterpiece "Burn" was. The band was already disintegrating during the recording of 
this album, with Blackmore leaving to form Rainbow soon after its release. Great title, 
great cover... What about the music? Certainly not bad (we're talking of Deep Purple, 
after all), but nothing earth-shaking either. <p>
As it is quite well-known, the main reason for Blackmore's departure were the overt 
funk influences brought to the band by new members David Coverdale and (especially) 
Glenn Hughes. Personally, I don't mind funky rythms at all, and bassist Hughes know 
what he's about. His singing is much more in evidence on this album than on "Burn", 
where  he shared vocal duties with Coverdale and had no opportunity to showcase his 
vocal talents on his own (as his partner did on "Mistreated"). Here, the two vocalists 
have a solo spot each, Coverdale with the acoustic, wistful "Soldier of Fortune" and 
Hughes with the soul-tinged "Holy Man", where his magnificent pipes get a chance to 
shine in all their glory. Coverdale's voice is almost a polar opposite, dark, emotional and 
much less polished - they are in many ways an ideal pairing. Shame about the egos 
taking over and wrecking the band. <p>
The trouble with "Stormbringer" is that the songs, while eminently listenable, have little 
personality of their own - with the notable exception of the sweeping title-track, the 
aforementioned "Soldier of Fortune" and "Holy Man", and the keyboard-driven, mid-
tempo "The Gypsy". There are a couple of straightforward hard rock numbers and 
another of more funky- and soul-influenced ones (which are, in my opinion, better than 
the former), but everything sounds a bit contrived and the strains tearing the band 
apart are quite evident. Jon Lord's mighty Hammond finds very little space, and 
Blackmore's incendiary guitar sounds remarkably lifeless. <p>
I gave this album three stars because I quite like it, though I recognise its 
shortcomings. Unlike its brilliant predecessor, it has very few prog elements, but it is 
not poppy or overtly commercial like other albums by other equally celebrated bands. 
Fans of Deep Purple will already own  (and possibly appreciate) it, but I would hesitate 
to recommend it to hardcore proggers.</strong></strong></em></em>

After having revamped their group, Rithchie and the boys came back with an absolutely 
superb album that brought everyone in agreement: Purple was back!!!! If Burn was a 
stunning album, little same can be said of its follow-up Strormbringer but it was close to a 
disaster and little wonder Blmackmore was to leave after this one.<p>The two new members had now enough time to integrate (unfortunately :-( and Glen 
Hughes was clearly trying to impose himself, something maybe Blackmore was not willing to 
fight since they had sollicited Hughes from Trapeze who was on the verge of making an 
impact back then, before his leaving. This album is full of tracks that have nothing to do 
with Purple's usual catalogue (except maybe a weak Lady Double Dealer) with a funked-up 
sound (Hughes's input) and clearly this album has no soul (despite some tracks being close 
to soul music). An excruciatingly bad album that is only saved from the garbage bin by the 
last two tracks , with The Gypsy the only correct Purple track and Soldier Of Fortune 
where Coverdale shows the full extent of his fabulous voice in a rather non-Purple 
fashion.<p>Although Purple unconditional fans will love this album as much as the other ones, there is 
little doubt that this album caused the end of Purple in the 70's and it is certainly not that 
sore excuse of an album with Bolin (talented guitarist but not suited to Purple)  replacing 
Blackmore that will show me wrong. Avoid</strong></strong></em></em>

  Stormbringer is one of my favourite Deep Purple albums. I've got nothing to criticise on 
this album, the music is simply outstanding as far as I'm concerned. There are no weak 
songs here: (here come the superlatives, excuse my enthusiasm) great hard rock songs - 
Stormbringer, High Ball Shooter, Lady Double Dealer, Hold On, the bluesy (funky) -  You 
Can't Do It Right and Love Don't Mean a Thing, and three slower tracks - Holy Man 
(amazing vocals from Glenn Hughes), Gypsy (brlliiant vocals from both Coverdale and 
Hughes, great guitar solo from Mr. Blackmore, and last but not least Soldier of Fortune 
(one of the best ballads ever).<p>   The bluesy direction of the album alienated Blackmore but the other members regrouped 
the next year to make one album with guitarist Tommy Bolin but dismembered after the 
tragic death of the guitarist. These things being said, I strongly recommend this album to 
both progheads and rockers everywhere, this album is a Must Have to any collector of 
prog and non-prog music.</strong></strong></em></em>

'Burn' was bordering on progressiveness, but "Stormbringer" is just not progressive at all. 
Most, if not all the songs have a straightforward hard rock structure. There is nothing 
wrong with this, "Stormbringer" is actually an okay hard rock album and it is enjoyable, to 
a certain extent. "Stormbringer "heralds the end of the classic Deep Purple era and the 
albums that followed were low grade and uninspired (some exceptions.) I guess this 
was brought about by the departure of practically all the original members who created 
such great works as 'Machine Head' and 'In Rock.' <p>When compared to other Deep Purple albums like 'Machine Head' or even 'Burn', some of 
"Stormbringer" is uninspired and bordering on 'bad.' Songs such as "Lady Double Dealer" 
and "Love Don't Mean A Thing" don't belong under the category of progressive rock, 
there is really almost nothing progressive about "Stormbringer" at all. There are a couple 
of highlights, the most prominent being the closing song -"Solider Of Fortune" which is a 
delightful acoustic ballad and is undoubtedly the best song on "Stormbringer", "Holy Man" 
isn't too bad either.<p>1. Stormbringer (2/5)
2. Love Don't Mean A Thing (2/5)
3. Holy Man (3/5)
4. Hold On (2/5)
5. Lady Double Dealer (2/5)
6. You Can't Do It Right (2/5)
7. High Ball Shooter (2/5)
8. The Gypsy (2/5)
9. Soldier Of Fortune (5/5)
Total = 21 divided by 9 (number of songs) = 2.333
= 2 stars
Collectors/fans only<p>"Stormbringer" is really not impressive in a progressive sense but as a hard rock album it 
would be around the three star level. So, the message is clear, I'd only recommend 
"Stormbringer" if you are a die-hard Deep Purple or hard rock fan.  <p></strong></strong></em></em>

I think, having Coverdale and Hughes on board, has changed a bit on the music style
of Deep Purple where this album has "funky" touch. That' okay with me as it gives
variety of DP music.  Again, I have differing view with many other friends of mine
who adored this album from the title track "Stormbringer". Nothing wrong with it but
for me the first track that attracted me was "High Ball Shooters". Nothing so special
about this track but I really loved the beat and energy. It reminded me to "You Fool
No One". Quite a strange taste, isn't ? But don't worry .. that was my first
impression about this album when the first time I heard it and as time went by I
started liking "Stormbringer" and "Lady Double Dealer". And later . I loved "You
Can't Do It Right" - it's truly a simple song with good melody. <p>Given the band excellent history with good music they have produced, I think no one
can deny that this is another good album from the band. You won't find long tracks
like Child In Time or Highway Star but . you will find this one is enjoyable. <p>Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW<p></strong></strong></em></em>

This album marked a complete departure from the hard rock sound most people had gotten 
to identify as the Purple sound. Stormbringer is a more bluesy/soul hard rock album, an 
album that I didn´t take much notice of until recently. I think the secret to becoming 
aquainted with this album is to accept that it has a strong bluesy feel.<p>"Stormbringer" is probably the hardest rocker on the entire album, a great opener and one 
of Purple´s most well known songs. 
Once " Love don´t mean a thing" begins, you realize that you are really listening to blues 
type rock with a lot of soul influences. The vocals on a lot of the tracks are shared by 
Coverdale and Hughes. Glen Hughes is a great soul singer! It was Stevie Wonder who 
actually said Hughes was one of his favorite singers!
There is a great guitar and keyboard solo on "Hold On" where Ritchie really gets down and 
plays some beautiful blues! It´s strange that he actually left after this album because he 
would make a great blues guitarist.The main reason he left was because of the soul/funk 
influence which was coming into play.<p>It is an interesting album with some great bluesy rockers, "You can´t do it right" has quite a 
funky feel to it while "The Gypsy" has some of Ritchie´s cleanest playing with that special 
Blackmore tone.
The bass playing on this album is really superb and you can hear the bass so clearly on 
headphones.<p>The album closes with the incredible "Soldier of Fortune", a Coverdale/Blackmore penned 
composition, which is a soft, slow ballad regarded by many as a Purple classic. Ritchie 
Blackmore recently did another version of this song with his current band, Blackmore´s 
Night.<p>It´s impossible to compare this album to "In Rock", "Fireball" or "Perfect Strangers" 
because there is a totally different blues feel to this album.
I was tempted to give it five stars but that would be biased, so four it is!<p>

Although I'm not big fan of David Coverdale, he did a great job here. Luckily,
Coverdale is not trying to be Gillan's carbon copy. The whole band took a slight turn
instead. 
Personally, I think that slight turn was an improvement. The band distanced from
thunderstriking hard rock numbers with screaming vocals, and meandered into something
more mature. One can criticize a certain lack of the energy that was present on earlier DP
records, but the band refunded that in other ways. Lord uses synths and electric
pianos rather than his Hammond C3.
Blackmore's Strat doesn't sound so frenetic anymore, his solos are bold and
effective. I don't mind if they are not too daring or experimenting as long as you
can describe the whole picture as good. Fear not, this album is far away from their
awful 80's works.
Aside from omnipresent blues roots, you can find traces of funky and soul here. This
mixing of the different (sometimes opposite) musical styles is usually not a good
idea (at least outside of the prog rock world), but this album is perfectly balanced
and mature. There is not much of an interest for a prog rock lover, save the
Lord's lovely solos and guitar in "The Gypsy". "Stormbringer" is mature and stable
album. Good sound quality, but not overproduced. If you like 70's mainstream
rock/hard-rock/AOR, and you are fed up with all that prog and you want to take some
rest for a while enjoying simpler but yet high quality music, this might be just for you.<p>This is radio-friendly rock at its best. A well-deserved three stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

Mark III on the follow-up of the excellent "Burn". This album was issued quite rapidly 
after Burn and honestly, they should have taken more time to do so to produce an 
album with more good songs. As usual, I purchased it at the time of release.
Quite a deception. No long tracks and quite a short album (they probably had nothing 
more to offer at the time). No anthem on this one.<p>The title and opening track is one the few good songs here. 
Good riff, strong vocals. A good piece of hard rock music.
"Love Don't Mean A Thing" is a bluesy / soul track sounding like a Stevie Wonder one; 
quite disturbing and very poor.
"Holy Man" is a sweet ballad which is quite unusual for the Purple : this track won't be 
remembered for a very long time.
The longest track of the album (just over five minutes) is the second good one : 
"Hold On" is a mix of blues and good old rock'n'roll.
An interesting combination. But, still we are really waiting for the first great moment of 
the album. <p>Turning over side-B, we finally are rewarded by our patience, "Lady Double Dealer" has 
a  frenetic rythm (drums and bass are great), very good vocal harmonies, great 
Ritchie's solo. 
What else do we need ? Well, actually a bit more songs like this ...
"You Can't Do It Right" is again very blues / soul influenced. Not my cup of tea AT ALL.
"High Ball Shooter" would have been considered as a filler on most Purple album, but on 
Stormbringer, it is almost a highlight. Good guitar riff and strong Paice on the drums. 
Jon's work (as good as always) is also noticeable but iT is one of the few moments in 
which one can feel his influence on this album (this is sufficiently scarce to pinpoint).
"The Gipsy" is a slow tempo hard rock piece of music with low vocals. 
During a short instrumental passage, it has a "Fools" flavour (from "Fireball").
The closing "Soldier Of Fortune" is again a ballad that one would not expect on a Purple 
album. Melody is nice, guitar is mellow. It sounds as an AOR song from the eighties ...<p>Commercially spoken, this album will not really be a great success (Nr. 6 in the UK and 
Nr. 20 in the US). Mark III did a better job of course with "Burn" which was also a far 
much better album of course (Nr. 3 in the UK, and Nr. 9 in the US). 
The descent is going on though. And it will almost never stop during all the Marks to 
come.
It is one of their weakest effort so far (with "The book of Talesyn" probably). 
Mark IV is ready for the next album...<p>I must say that I do not listen to this album frequently (I guess that between 76 and 
2006, I must have spinned it ... four or five times only). 
I would have been in real trouble if you would have asked me to name two tracks of 
this album. This is significant enough for a true (but not too biased) Purple fan as I am.
Not too many bad songs (one or two) but really too little good ones to make this album 
a Purple classic.
Two stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

DP proved they could survive without the triple octave scream and innuendo-fueled lyrics of Ian Gillan with Burn. However, 
Stormbringer showed tensions and proved that Ritchie Blackmore does not work well with others. The real surprise here is the 
addition of lightweight funk courtesy of bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes. As if it wasn't weird enough when middle class white 
Englishmen started playing the blues, now they've added funk to the repetoire? Still, every time you listen to the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers or Primus, you have this man to thank.<p>The highlights are the fun title track, "Soldier of Fortune," "Lady Double Dealer," and "Holy Man," which features Glenn on lead 
vocals. It doesn't amtch up to the fiery intensity of Burn (no pun intended), but it's a fun Purple album nonetheless.<p>Funk didn't gel with Blackmore's neo-classical shredding however, and he quite objectively dubbed the album "shoeshine music" and, 
rather eloquently, "crap." He decided to quit his band and form Rainbow after seizing control of DP's support band Elf. After some 
tweaking (meaning firing everyone but Ronnie James Dio and hiring session gods Cozy Powell, Don Airey, and Jimmy Bain), Rainbow 
emerged and pumped out the neo-classical that fans expected, and became the blueprint band for early power metal. But for now, 
sit back and enjoy the lighter side of Deep Purple.<p>Grade: C</strong></strong></em></em>

A 4 star album to me if not for many of you<p>Another good Purple album in contrast with the reviews from here, i find it one of the best Purple albums. The unique voice of David 
Coverdale made Purple to resist fiew years and not colapse in the banal hard rock. Still  a great album with catchy tunes and nice 
blend between prog and hard rock. I never find Deep Purple a prog band, not even the first albums, i think they are one of the 
pioneers of hard rock, but with all that they have some prog elements that deserve to be here in prog archives. So, some very good 
tracks are Stormbringer that opens the album in a hard rock manner, Lady Double Dealer again a hard piece that shows Purple is still 
in business and High Ball Shooter, all of these tracks are classic music as egg is agg, the rest are good too. If you don't have this one 
go and get it worth every track. 4 stars for sure.</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>"The songs that I have sung echo in the distance, like the sound of a windmill going round"</strong><p>When Blackmore and Gillan left Deep Purple to be replaced by Hughes and Coverdale, many people wondered whether the band 
would survive. The first release by the new line up, "Burn", proved to be highly reassuring as it incorporated many of the elements 
which had made previous albums so distinctive and appealing. Although Hughes in particular had brought with him a funkier style, 
the changes were subtle, and the vast majority of fans concluded that the future of the band they loved was secure.<p>"Stormbringer" therefore came as something of a shock. Suddenly, Deep Purple had veered away from the power rock we expected 
from them, into alternative territories. Whether responsibility for this lies entirely with Hughes is doubtful, but it is a matter of record 
that Ritchie Blackmore was unhappy with the change of direction, and left the band. <p>Significantly, the tracks are all short, the longest being a mere 5 minutes. The brevity of the tracks reflects the fact that there is no 
attempt whatsoever to come up with a <I>feature</I> track, every song being simple in structure and delivery.<p>The opening title track is actually rather deceptive. It has the driving rhythm and fantasy lyrics which featured on songs such 
as "Fireball" and "Burn", thus suggesting that this will be another Deep Purple album to satisfy the faithful. The song itself however is 
relatively weak when compared to past masters. All too soon though "Love don't mean a thing" introduces the funky, soul influenced 
sounds which dominate the album. The song is dull, uninspired and devoid of character. There is simply nothing about it which relates 
to the signature music of Deep Purple. Sadly, this sets the tone for the rest of the album which is a collection of ordinary pop songs 
with a soul/funk tinge.<p>There is one exception here, which is saved for the last track. Quite out of the blue, Blackmore and Coverdale come up with one of 
the finest rock ballads ever recorded. "Soldier of fortune", sung by Coverdale alone is a superbly evocative song with sensitive lyrics 
and a delightful melody. It is quite at odds with the rest of the album, but in its own right it is absolutely essential. <p>In summary, not an album for the Deep Purple faithful, or anyone else for that matter, but if it is the only way you can secure a 
copy of "Soldier of fortune", then it becomes essential.  <p></strong></strong></em></em>

Unfortunately, the Mark III line-up did not repeat the success of the previous, remarkable album "Burn". "Stormbringer" is more 
than an average work, focusing on the shorter tracks and some mainstream "arena rock" harmonies typical of certain American 
bands of the era. The material is pretty much negligable. Other than excellent, fiery heavy rock of the title track (with a memorable 
Blackmore's weeping guitar solo), very good easy rocking quasi-ballad "The Gypsy" (one of better Coverdale's singing moments in 
the PURPLE catalogue) and an interesting attempt at funk in "You Can't Do It Right", the album is quite dissapointing. "The Soldier of 
Fortune"? Give me a break! <p>PESRONAL RATING: 2,5/5<p>P.A. RATING: 2/5</strong></strong></em></em>

I've been a Deep Purple fan for almost 30 years, and I must say this one is the most underrated of DP albums.  I even turn to it 
more often than "Burn" thse days.  This is a mixed bag for Deep Purple, as it sounds a little like Deep Purple, a little like 
Whitesnake...and a little like Dio-era Rainbow(especially the majestic rock ballads without the sappy lyrics in "Holy Man" and "Soldier 
Of Fortune", which sound not unlike "Catch The Rainbow" and "Rainbow Eyes" from Rainbow).  Great stuff all around for a 
somewhat eclectic mix.  "Gypsy" and "High Ball Shooter" are known in hard rock circles for good reason("High Ball Shooter" getting 
the remake done several times).  "Lady Double Dealer" -  one the more chauvinistic tracks recorded by the band is still a rocker 
nonetheless with a stellar David Coverdale vocal. He means it when he sings: "Get outta my way...I'm gettin' tired of YOU!".  A 
modest 4 stars, this one.</strong></strong></em></em>

Not what I would describe as progressive but it's here on the archives so let's give this one its dues.<p>After the tremendous Burn the shift to a smoother, jazz/funky/sleazy style of rock continued.
Coverdale and Hughes are superb. The almost incomparable Paice is not so much to the fore as in Burn
and that is to be regretted. <p>The title track retains a quintessential DP sound, and You can't do it Right with the one you want
is a great track. Soldier of Fortune unfortunately shares the same title as a simply brilliant Thin
Lizzy which is a good as DP's version is mediocre.<p>Nevertheless, this is an interesting DP III album. Certainly not just for the officianados: ggod but
not essential.</strong></strong></em></em>

Burn had been a rebirth for the band after the lacklustre Who Do We Think We Are album. Apart from the 
previous Who Do We Think We Are album, Burn was the first Deep Purple album that was properly 
recorded and produced. Stormbringer continues that tradition. Burn has also been the first Deep Purple 
album to include synthesisers. Again, Stormbringer continues that tradition. Unfortunately, these 
improvements in instrumentation and production coincided with them going in more of straightforward 
blues rock on the majority of the tracks. Yet again, Stormbringer continues that tradition. Indeed, it is 
hard to think of something that differentiates Stormbringer from Burn except that there is no counterpart 
to the interesting instrumental A200. Instead we get an acoustic ballad called Soldier of Fortune, complete 
with keyboard orchestration. This is easily the best song on this album. (A side note. Ritchie still plays this 
song live in Blackmore's Night. Candice, his wife, sings it beautifully).<p>Burn had started with a great song of the same name. Stormbringer starts in the same way, though the 
song is not as good as Burn, but not bad. Just like on Burn, the following songs are far worse and are far 
away from prog. Both albums are somewhat fun to listen to, but they are not memorable and have 
nothing to do with prog.  <p>Stormbringer is basically a Xerox of Burn and deserves for that reason alone a lower rating. But if you 
love Burn, Stormbringer is essential. For the rest of us, it is enough with one of these albums and I would 
go for Burn, though it is not much difference between them in quality. Ritchie would go on to greater 
things in Rainbow after this album.<p>Stormbringer is certainly not the place to start for prog fans who want to explore Deep Purple. You should 
start with Fireball, then the self-titled album from 1969, and after that, the live album Made In Japan or a 
more recent live DVD of your choice. First after that you should check out In Rock and Machine Head. And 
if you still want more after that then Burn is a better choice than Stormbringer. <p>The beautiful Soldier of Fortune could not save this album from a mere two star rating.

Deep Purple's last album to feature Ritchie Blackmore on guitar (until the mark II revival in 1984) is a 
much maligned work. While there are great songs on it, it also showed some uncharacteristic tunes. I 
see it as a transitional period where the band could evolve into another thing, but unfortunatly or not, 
that was not to be. Here we have those classic hard rock sound with prog, classical and even blues 
influence together with a more funky/soul leaning brought by newcomers Glenn Hughes (mostly) and 
Coverdale (some). Ritchie Blackmore is reported to hate the new musical direction, but in interviews he 
complained about the 'self indulgencyof some members while everyone were expecting him to bring 
on the tunes. Whatever the true reasons, he'd soon be gone. It would be interesting to know what DP 
would bring next if he head stayed (certainly something  better than Come Taste The Band!).<p>The album starts very well with the classic title track: I love the 'storming guitar sound' and the great 
double tracked, dueling guitar solo in the middle.  The next three tracks however are way too different 
in both style and form and hardcore DP fans had a tough time to swallow the explicit black influences of 
Love Don't Mean A Thing or Hold On. Even the soulful ballad Holy Man has nothing to do with anything 
DP has done before. That song also featured Glenn Hughes singing all the vocal parts alone for the first 
time in a Deep Purple Record.<p>Side two started very well with the powerful hard rocker Lady Double Dealer. However, You Can't Do It 
Right is another funky number complete with a startling clavinet riff by Jon Lord. Blackmore also proves 
he absorbed that guitar style very well. High Ball Shooter shows the band tackling again the familiar 
ground of a ballsy hard rock, with a fine Hammond solo by Lord. The Gypsy is a beautiful slow number 
with great lead vocals by Hughes and Coverdale (singing all the parts together. Brilliant!). The album 
finishes with another novelty for Purple: the beautiful acoustic ballad Soldier Of Fortune. Of note is the 
fact that Lord used a vast array of keyboards on this record to augment the familiar Hammond organ 
and the synthesizers he had just started to explore on the previous CD Burn. For the first time we see 
him playing the Fender Rhodes piano (On Gypsy and Hold On) and the Mellotron (Soldier Of Fortune). <p>Although a much critized album at the time, Stormbringer showed that the mix of their trademark 
classic hard rock and the new black influences could work something quite new and interesting. If they 
had the time to work out their problems I'm sure this line up could have come with something at least 
very strong and maybe even groundbreaking. But the powers that be decided otherwise and the rest is 
history. Anyway I still find this a great CD. Unsual, but brilliant anyway. Progressive in the broader 
meaning of the term. 4 stars.

Nice album again after the new established Deep Purple with David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes after
Burn. This is the second and last album made by mark III of Deep Purple. And its wonderful journey in
the world of Deep Purple. David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes alternate with each other on vocal duties
and this brings in new fascination to the album! I see this album
is not much loved here in PA and I really can't find the reason about that. In my opinion, this is
one very interesting moment in the history of the band. The musicianship is perfect and all songs
are definite classics in the world of hard rock music. Full of funk and soul elements, this album
reveal all the variety of hard rock music; this became the reason for the quit of Ritchie Blackmore,
who's known as pure hard rock musician; his unhappiness after the album became bigger and bigger,
because of the direction the band have taken under the influence of David Coverdale and Glenn
Hughes. I have to mention the great style of playing for Ian Paice on drums, again. Here are some of
his most completed performances in the entire Deep Purple's career. On Stormbringer, his style is 
full of uneven saturated tunes and dynamic way of performance. Despite, not being progressive, this
album is here in PA and as one of the most innovative albums by Deep Purple it will get what deserves - not less than 4 stars!</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong> SOULBRINGER </strong><p>Ahh, Stormbringer, my second studio album purchase from the masters of Hammond-Organ led Heavy Rock. After having listened to
Come Taste the Band, I wanted more with the same singer: David Coverdale. I've heard a compilation
of Deep Purple which featured Stormbringer, and gees, it rocked!! In the same vein as Burn or many
rockers from the MK 2. Anyways, I was in for a surprise, the album as a whole ended up being a
totally different thing.<p>Burn had showed the fans that even without Gillan and Glover that they could still ROCK! Classic
tunes everywhere, stunning guitar solos, heavy riffs, flashy hammond solos, stunning vocal
perfomances and like always a powerful drumming.<p>With Stormbringer, Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale decided to contribute with their own ideas
rather than following orders from The Man in Black. Jon Lord and Ian Paice just followed
instructions and, as always, doing a wonderful job in any of the styles commanded. This bringing
Ritchie upset and finally deciding to leave the band after the tour from this album, and as a result making
his own band, Rainbow, this one following the foot-steps of the hard rock songs from here, which are
few, as well as new ideas.<p>Stormbringer besides the heavy title track, which is unfortunately a misleading opener due to
making the listener think it will be another Burn album, the album in general features a soft,
chilling mood, never heard before in any Deep Purple album. This is consequence of Glenn's contribution to
the band, introducing his funk roots from his first band, Trapeze. Still you got one more rocker, Lady
Double Dealer, bringing back memories of their heavy rock days, though to be honest, it's a quite
weak one. And at the end of the album, you got Soldier of Fortune and The Gypsy, both in the vein of
future Rainbow, led by Ritchie Blackmore, of course. Soldier of Fortune featuring a ballad style,
still very interesting, being one of the few acoustic tunes ever made by Deep Purple; Ritchie would
make a similar song with Rainbow called Catch the Rainbow, again, with excellent vocal perfomance,
this time with Dio. Then The Gypsy, features the darker mood of the title track, more in the style
of their previous album, Burn, while not heavy, you can definitely mix it in a compilation with
songs from Burn. These 4 songs, Stormbringer, Lady Double Dealer, The Gypsy & Soldier of Fortune,
resemble the ''classic'' roots of Burn, no funk influences, just pure Ritchie & Co, rather than the
''real'' MK 3/4, which really is Hughes, Coverdale(and Bolin) & Co.<p>The rest of the album, Love Don't Mean a Thing, Holy Man, Hold On, You Can't Do It Right and High
Ball Shooter, is what made hardcore MK 2, hard rock and Deep Purple fans in general dissapointed. All these songs
featuring the new ideas from Mr. Hughes, creating a totally chilled or groovy band, still with
excellent song-writing and composition, as well as musicianship. The ones featuring a groovy style
would be, You Can't Do It Right and Hold On, with their addictive chorus'. The first one featuring
further exploration of the Moog by Jon Lord, which would soon replace his classic Hammond-Organ in
the following album, and later in Whitesnake, as well as having addictive riff. Then, Hold On,
features addictive, catchy duo vocals, from Hughes and Coverdale, simply STUNNING! As well as a
classic guitar solo, and a catchy hammond solo, pittily short. Previously, Love Don't Mean a Thing
and Holy Man, are featured in the album, presenting the chilling influences from Hughes. Both
featuring a entertaining song-writing and composition, even if they're chilling songs, Love Don't
Mean a Thing again features the beautiful duo of vocals, while Holy Man focuses on Glenn's wide
high-pitched variation vocals, simply wonderful. Finally High Ball Shooter, being the last song
compromising the ''hate'' songs from this album, while oddly enough, this one may boder-line with
some hard rock roots, mainly because of it's riff, which was created way back in Burn. Anyways, the
song compromises a big funk/groovy influence also, mainly lead by Jon's amazing Organ, which he
decides in this song, to make a 1 minute Organ solo, while not as awesome as Lazy's, it's just
incredible, and really makes this song excellent. <p>As you see, Stormbringer is a mixed bag of 4 songs compromising Deep Purple's classic hard rock style, while
the rest, are adventuring through new grounds as well as letting more song-writing freedom to the
new members. I'm in the odd side here, simply loving the new influences incorporated to the 5 songs
mentioned before, while pretty caring less about the 4 classic DP song-writing song, this is surely
because these are not excellent written hard rock songs, which if I decide to listen to DP rocking,
I take any album from In Rock up to Burn rather than listen to average at best rockers in an excellent groovy/chilling album.
Stormbringer truly shows the real talents of Glenn and David as song-writers, as well as vocalists. <p>Pitty the album isn't consistent, if it were, it would surely be a masterpiece like Come Taste the
Band. <p>4 stars: those who expect another Burn, please don't come here. Those who really want to know David's
and Glenn's capabilities as song-writers and vocalists, this album is it. While of course, if you
liked this because of the groovy side, then make sure to check the following, Come Taste the Band.  </strong></strong></em></em>

"If a shocking element that Deep Purple is new can be added, let's stay in the band. "<p>It is said that Ritchie Blackmore did the above-mentioned remark when the time composed 
of the member of the second stage for DP faces the last stage. It was an event in the 
process of the production of "Who Do We Think We Are" that Blackmore groped for the 
secession of the band by thinking. The problem of the rough going for the production of this 
album and the schedule exists in the band and the crack is caused in the member of the 
band as a result. <p>The band does the decision to replace the member to change directionality radically. Paice 
and Lord were persuaded to make Glenn Hughes that was on the register in "Trapeze" join 
the band. The story of the joining has been cut off though Blackmore was thought that Paul 
Rodgers is suitable for Vocalist of the band so that Rodgers may form the Bad company. <p>It ..band.. ..album of consenting content.. finished enough newly because of a general 
public advertisement for ..produced "Burn".. Blackmore on David Coverdale that joined. The 
start of DP of this third stage was an event that exactly gave the excitement for the listener. 
Live in this "Burn" and California becomes a legend and remains still in listener's mind for 
them. <p>However, the world of Music who existed in the foundation of Hughes and Coverdale that 
joined newly was in the angle besides the element of the lock like DP. Coverdale that loves 
Marvin Gaye. And, Hughes that respects Stevie Wonder. Those elements tried to be taken 
to this album transiently. This event becomes a chance that Blackmore secedes the band. <p>The idea of Blackmore has the feeling refused by the band. It appears remarkably in this 
album. The tune to which Blackmore had kept the style beauty that the band had had at this 
time was only "Soldier Of Fortune". This beautiful melody was a tune admitted in the tune 
from which Blackmore was collected to this album. However, the entire composition can 
listen to the fact that the band has shifted to the route of Hughes-Coverdale after 
announcing "Burn". <p>"Funk is hated though I like music that the black invents" It is said that it is one reason why 
he secedes the band for the directionality of this band as for the remark of this Blackmore. 
Tunes such as "Love Don't Mean A Thing" and "Hold On" are tunes of which the color of 
about soulful and funky went out strongly by the tune with the element not obviously 
achieved in the member of the second stage. It exists in their Music's history such a tune if 
it says oppositely however valuable. <p>A hard tune such as "Stormbringer" and "High Ball Shooter" might get excited in case of the 
fan of DP of the second stage if it considers it from the item of hard rock. However, 
Blackmore consistently says that it is the lowest this album. I think that this album is a 
valuable work that the idea of Hughes-Coverdale in addition to their style beauty is united if 
the subjective opinion is added. It might be a peculiar album where those elements arose 
in the flow that the band had at this time. I thought that it was "Holy Man" personally 
masterpiece. And, the band that faced such a critical situation sarcastically had the flow that 
invented the hidden masterpiece that was called secession and "Come Taste The Band" of 
Blackmore. </strong></strong></em></em>

Released in the same year as <em>Burn</em>, this album brings a very different Deep Purple on the
scene. Hughes and Coverdale had settled in more comfortably and did clearly not want to be bossed
around by Blackmore anymore. They brought in some funk and soul in the sound and that must have
appalled Blackmore so much that he left Deep Purple soon after its release.  <p>I think he even kept his best songs from this period to himself and relayed them to Rainbow's debut
that was released only 6 months after <em>Stormbringer</em>. It all left this Deep Purple album in a
poor state with only 3 songs to save it from forgetfulness. <em>Stormbringer</em>, <em>Gypsy</em> and
<em>Soldier of Fortune</em> are good songs that stand head and shoulders above the rest of the album. <p>I'd only recommend this to die-hard fans of Deep Purple's <em>Burn</em> and Rainbow's debut.</strong></strong></em></em>

This is a very difficult album to review.  Mostly because it is so hard to pay attention to it while it 
is on the turntable.  There is very little of that old Deep Purple energy.  In fact, it sounds a lot 
more like an early ZZ Top album than Deep Purple.  It is no wonder that Richie Blackmore left 
after this album.<p>The album isn't totally bad, the opening track <I>Stormbringer</I> tries to recreate the magic 
the band had just a few short years earlier, but doesn't quite get there. <I>Lady Double 
Dealer</I> tries as well, but fails at the mundane chorus.  Not surprisingly, the group 
disbanded for nearly a decade after the next album, until the classic lineup reunited for the 
album "Perfect Strangers".</strong></strong></em></em>

When I started writing album reviews in 1999, I did it largely because I looked forward to the 
chance to organize my thoughts and impressions on albums that I liked. Yet I always knew 
there was a downside to my endeavour, no matter how hard I tried to ignore it; inevitably, my 
passion would force me to review legions of mediocre, unremarkable albums whose 
existence added virtually nothing of worth to my life. <strong>Stormbringer</strong> is one of these 
albums, with one major highlight and then a half hour of mediocre bleh. The title track is a 
classic, thank goodness; the keyboard sounds often suck like mad, but they're only a slight 
distraction from an intense, driving metallic blast (a little slower than previous DP metallic 
blasts, but fine nonetheless) that makes David sound gruff and cool, and that seems to 
keep Ritchie interested in what's going on.<p><p>I wish I could say that about the rest of the album. The thing that just drives me nuts is how 
<em>ordinary</em> the band sounds on this album; Ritchie doesn't sound like he's enjoying 
himself at all, Jon doesn't add the least bit of spark to the sound, and Ian never gets the 
chance to go beyond regular r&b and mid-tempo boogie rock. As for the songs themselves, 
the bulk of the album is basically a bunch of tenth-rate Stevie Wonder funk imitations, with 
David and Glenn making total asses of themselves. Good golly, I cannot believe I forced 
myself to repeatedly sit through an album that has a song with David Coverdale singing the 
line, "I'm gonna take you home and give you all I can, baby, I'll prove to you woman that, 
really, I'm a man." There's a couple of "purer" rockers that seem a little better to my ears, 
though "Gypsy" really isn't much more than somewhat interesting (somebody wake Ritchie 
up!), and the riffage of "Lady Double Dealer" is nowhere as thick and satisfying as Ritchie 
and Co. had shown they could make similar sounding parts in the past.<p><p>Oh, and there's a couple of ballads, one of which is alright and one of which is basically 
atrocious. "Holy Man" (with just Glenn on vocals) is a bit pompous lyrically, but it's at least 
pretty in the verses, largely thanks to some uncharacteristic slide guitar (we last had that 
on "Anyone's Daughter," right?). The closing "Soldier of Fortune," however, is every bit as 
bad as one can imagine a power ballad sung by David Coverdale could be. PULL OUT 
YER LIGHTERS, EVERYONE!!! And dig one of the tackiest uses of mellotron ever conjured 
up by mortal man!<p><p>I wrote more about this album than it deserves. Ritchie left in disgust as soon as touring for 
this album was over, and it's hard to blame him; in just a couple of years, DP had gone 
from one of the most interesting and unique heavy rock bands in the world to ordinary in 
every sense of the word. If you're REALLY in the mood for an inferior, more funkified version 
of <strong>Burn</strong>, go for it, otherwise just keep walking.</strong></strong></em></em>

Unfortunately, it seems that by mid 1974 the members of  DEEP PURPLE as a band were not very 
sure of the musical direction they were going to follow for their next album. Maybe the remaining 
original members of the band (Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice) were  tired of being working 
in the band without a break, and they let  the most recent "new" members (Glenn Hughes and David 
Coverdale) to take the leadership for this "Stormbringer" album. The music is not bad, but in most parts 
it does not sound very related to the original musical style of the band (Hard Rock / Heavy Metal). It 
sounds very influenced by Funky, Soul and Blues music, styles of music which were more liked by 
Hughes (who it has been said to be the most adept to these musical styles) and  Coverdale. As I have 
written in other reviews about this line-up, both Coverdale and Hughes have powerful vocals, but the 
problem is that their musical tastes were somewhat far from the original musical style of the band. 
Maybe the original members were somewhat bored and also wanted to try some new musical things, 
but in this album it seems that they gave most of the control of the musical direction of the band to 
Hughes and Coverdale. So,most  songs ( "Love Don`t Mean a Thing", "Holy Man", "Hold On",  "You 
Can`t Do I t Right" and "High Ball Shooter") really sound like influenced a lot by artists like STEVIE 
WONDER and other similar artists from the mid seventies. Even some of the keyboards arrangements 
sound very influenced by these artists.  They don`t sound bad...but they sound very far from DEEP 
PURPLE`s original musical style. Only "Stormbringer", "Lady Double Dealer", "The Gypsy"  and 
"Soldier of Fortune" sound closer to that old musical style. Maybe the best song in this album is 
"Soldier of Fortune", which sounds a bit more related to "Catch the Rainbow", a song which Blackmore 
was going to record with his new band in their first album titled "Ritchie Blackmore`s Rainbow", in 
1975. <p>After the tour for this album Blackmore left the band, being replaced by Tommy Bolin, and the band 
carried on for one more album ("Come Taste the Band"). and they finally split in March 1976 after the tour for that album.</strong></strong></em></em>

Easy and approachable, <em>Stormbringer</em> satisfies a hard-rock itch by scratching with the right combination of loud 
and heavy riffing, rugged vocals by David Coverdale, and Blackmore's signature guitar soloing. John Lord's keyboards, 
which occasionally drift into the funky lilting of the era's R&B/Soul sound, add an interesting touch as well. Some 
reviewers describe that <em>Stormbringer</em> is an off putting album because it plays with the Deep Purple formula a 
little too much; after all, this is Blackmore's last record with the group before he formed the (more interesting) 
Rainbow. For me, my criticism drifts more to the song writing, which is about 50% creative hard rock or thoughtful 
balladry, and 50% sex-drugs-and-rock-and-roll schlock. A few of these moments will appeal to prog fans, but for 
newcomers to the band <em>Stormbringer</em> may not be much more than a fun diversion in to '70's hard rock. Which, 
in scheme of things, is actually a pretty awesome place to be! Check it out after listening the bands more complete and 
influential works.<p>Songwriting: 2 - Instrumental Performances: 3 - Lyrics/Vocals: 2 - Style/Emotion/Replay: 3</strong></strong></em></em>

Stormbringer was Deep Purple's 9th full length album, and saw the band move more towards a funky sound, but retaining the 
hard-rock, blues inspired sound that they had in 'Burn'.  This was also the 2nd album to feature David Coverdale as the lead 
singer as he replaced Ian Gilian as the lead singer.  Ian, of course, would eventually sign up with Black Sabbath for one 
album, 'Born Again' and eventually reunite with Deep Purple in 1984 for the album 'Perfect Strangers'.  <p>Stormbringer ended up being a fairly successful album, though it was a bit weaker than previous efforts.  The long, jam-like 
sessions of the past were gone and were replaced with songs that were more vocally heavy and more basic hard rock tunes.  
Even though it was early for hair metal (the album was released in 1974), it seems to take on that style more than the 
psychedelic rock of their earlier albums.  <p>Even though the mainstays Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice and Jon Lord were still in the band, it seems their influence was heard 
much less on this album.  The album seems to be directed more towards Coverdale's one-dimensional vocals, but at least Glenn 
Hughes' vocals were also used fairly extensively on many tracks, it helped give a bit more variety to the album.  Unfortunately, 
for Coverdale, that variety didn't follow him when he left Deep Purple in tears after the release of their following album 'Come 
Taste the Band' which saw the downfall of the popularity of the band as they continued to chase the more accessible sound of 
hard funk, sounding more like Grand Funk than anything else, a bad version of Grand Funk that is.  Of course, Coverdale would 
see success with Whitesnake in the 80s, as his hair metal dreams came true.  But then, I've never really been a fan of Coverdale 
as he seems to turn bands he is involved with towards a more commercial sound that is as one-dimensional as his voice. <p>Stormbringer, however, isn't a complete wash.  The other band members still have some chances to show off, like Lord's organ 
solo in 'High Ball Shooter'.  But unfortunately, most of the tracks have Coverdale's annoying vocals (like in the awful 'The Gypsy') 
that end up making the songs of the album sound too much alike.  One of the main reasons I liked Deep Purple was because of 
their heavy rocking instrumentals and psychedelic leanings.  This album just about totally goes against that sound, and Deep 
Purple just sounds like every other mediocre hard rock band.  What might have been a great album only becomes an average 
one.  After the next album, the band would basically fall apart until finally in 1984, they come out of hiding and emerge from the 
dregs of hair metal to produce a better album with the return of Ian and the release of 'Perfect Stranger.'

Stormbringer is a very lacklustre effort from the Deep Purple 
legends. It just lacks the passion and power of their previous 
releases. Apart from the wonderful title track it lacks energy 
and is not really hard rock overall. There's no prog and it's 
forgettable. The band were in turmoil and it is little wonder 
with Coverdale in a sombre mood and Blackmore being ready 
to jump ship for Rainbow. Although his guitar is proficient on 
tracks such as The Gypsy, High Ball Shooter and Hold On, and 
there's some tasty keyboards on offer, there is a lot that was 
discarded. The heavy rock and killer riffs are overall absent.<p>Frenetic tempos abound on Lady Double Dealer, and they 
dabble in funk rock on You Can't Do it Right, but it is not 
worth repeated spins as a total album. Having heard the 
earlier releases it is hard not to compare those classics of 
rock to what we have here. Even the albums of recent years 
are better than this effort. <p>Stormbringer has had a 35th Anniversary release since, 
remastered and with quadrophonic versions of each track, 
and a bunch of remixes, but it is difficult to enjoy Deep Purple 
when they seem to be going for a new sound, when we love 
them the way they are as a band brimming with 
dynamic energy, with killer riffs and innovative lyrics.   </strong></strong></em></em>

With Jon Lord using more and more synths after experimenting with them on "Burn", this album comes closer to prog rock, at
