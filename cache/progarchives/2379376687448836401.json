  "genre": "Jazz Rock/Fusion",
  "country": "Czech Republic",
  "biography": "Blue Effect (Modr\ufffd Efekt) biography\n\nFounded in Czechoslovakia in 1968 - Disbanded in 1990 - Reformed from 2004 to 2016\n\nLead by ace guitarist Radim Hlad\ufffdk, BLUE EFFECT were one of the major progressive bands in Czechoslovakia; they were to their own country what OMEGA were to Hungary, or SBB to Poland. They started out in 1968 with a couple of early R&B-oriented albums. However, the Czech governement strongly disapproved of English names at the time, so the band switched to MODR\ufffd EFEKT and later to simply M.EFEKT. After these two albums, their material veered towards jazz rock and by the early 80's, following sereval personnel changes, their music had become a little less prog, more accessible. They released their last album in 1981 and then quietly disappeared.\n\nOf particular interest to prog fans are three albums: \"Modr\ufffd Efekt & Radim Hlad\ufffdk\" (1975) which features an energetic mix of YES-like symphonic rock with some fusion; the overall effect will likely remind you of FINCH or CRUCIS. Emphasizing Hladik's brilliant soloing, this was the album that established him as \"the\" Czech guitarist par excellence. However, it is \"Svitanie\" (1977) that is considered the band's true masterpiece. With its sinewy bass lines and bold keyboard/guitar melodies, it is still quite YES-influenced but it also has a definite Czech flavour that makes it unique. Finally, there is the bolder, more complex and not so YES-like album titled \"Svet Hledacu - World of Searchers\" (1979); this one is characterized by many sudden tempo shifts and emphasizes the flux between the spacey synths and Hladik's biting guitars. Except for this album, whose 5 official tracks are all sung, the band's r\ufffdpertoire is mostly instrumental.\n\nPrimarily recommended to fusion lovers but YES fans will also likely find something to sink their teeth into.\n\n: : : Lise (HIBOU), CANADA : : :",
