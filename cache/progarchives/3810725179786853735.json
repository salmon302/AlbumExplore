  "biography": "Steven John Wilson\n\n- Born 3 November 1967 (Kingston upon Thames, London, UK)\n\nSTEVEN WILSON, perhaps most widely known for his role as the frontman for the popular act\n\nPORCUPINE TREE\n\n, is an artist from the UK who, through his various side projects, has spanned a vast number of musical ideas and concepts. Some of the styles he has been known to utilize are heavy prog, psychedelic, electronica, post-rock, ambient music, drone, metal, and art rock. Furthermore, WILSON is intensely focused on production values, dynamic mixing and mastering, and all other sorts of building albums that sound best in high-quality systems. In short, WILSON has always been an artist that appeals to audiophiles and fans of meticulously produced music. This shows up strongly in each of his bands and projects, but it plays even more of a role in his solo efforts.\n\nPhoto by Lasse Hoile\n\nThough some of his earliest musical recordings were demos that predated even Porcupine Tree, his solo releases did not truly start appearing until his \"Cover Version\" singles began in 2003. Essentially releasing one a year, each \"Cover Version\" contained a particularly unconventional song that WILSON chose to reproduce and one original song by WILSON. Also, in 2004, WILSON put out his experimental electronic album \"Unreleased Electronic Music Vol. 1.\" Neither the \"Cover Version\" singles nor \"Unreleased Electronic Music\" feature any other performers, aside from some input from THEO TRAVIS on the latter.\n\n\u2b50 Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2013 \u2b50\n\n\u2b50 Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2011 \u2b50\n\nThat trend changed at the end of 2008, however, when WILSON released his first full-length, proper solo album, \"Insurgentes.\" Featuring, among others, PORCUPINE TREE drummer Gavin Harrison, Prog bass legend TONY LEVIN, current DREAM THEATER keyboardist JORDAN RUDESS, and saxophonist/flautist THEO TRAVIS, \"Insurgentes\" proves rather quickly that it is not simply another ambient or electronic release. Toying with many of the styles that can be seen in PORCUPINE TREE, \"Insurgentes\" is a mature, laid-back album marked by less metal and more noise than PT's later albums. WILSON has stated that the album draws a lot of influence from shoe gazer, post-punk, and drone music.\n\nEssentially, before \"Insurgentes,\" WILSON used his solo moniker for a final catch-all for some of his music, making it difficult to draw comparisons to other bands. Nevertheless, \"Insurgentes\" makes it possible to site some bands with similar sound. Of notable similarity or inspiration are RADIOHEAD, JOY DIVISION, GODSPEED YOU! BLACK EMPEROR, THE MARS VOLTA, and other WILSON projects such as BASS COMMUNION and PORCUPINE TREE.\n\nSee also:\n\nBLACKFIELD\n\nNO-MAN\n\nI.E.M.\n\nBASS COMMUNION\n\nthanks to Spence (LiquidEternity) for the biography",
