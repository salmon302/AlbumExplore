  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "biography": "National Health biography\n\nFounded in Canterbury, England in 1975 - Disbanded in 1980\n\nNATIONAL HEALTH was one of the last of the great \"Canterbury-style\" progressive rock bands. This band performed the same shiny Canterbury Progressive with a touch of jazz-rock, following\n\nHATFIELD AND THE NORTH\n\n's philosophy, with  complex keyboards parts, the saturated guitar of\n\nPhil MILLER\n\n. Their first eponymous opus is one of the most important albums of the Canterbury scene, containing a unique mixture of rock, jazz and classical music. This is a great find for Canterbury fans and a rare treat in the spirit of the likes of GENTLE GIANT, SPOCK'S BEARD and ECHOLYN.",
