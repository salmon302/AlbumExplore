A combination of Jon Anderson and Roine Stolt. It should not surprise anyone, but still itÃ?Â´s very nice
to them both together at last. Well, it is no secret that Stolt is an avid fan of Anderson. He went
as far as dedicate a whole album (The Flower King) to Anderson in 1994, long before they ever met.
And anyone who has ever heard a Flower Kings album will know how strongly Yes influenced their
music. So I guess that a collaboration was a natural thing to happen. Stolt even asked some of his
colleagues from TFK to give a hand (the ever present bassist Jonas Reingold and current drummer
Felix Lehrmann, plus his brother  and ex TFK Michael Stolt for a couple of tracks). Top swedish
players Tom Brislin (Spiraling)  and Lalle Larsson  (Karmakanic, Agents of Mercy) help along on the
keyboards. And Invention of Knowledge is the result. <p>The music here is inspired and convincing, almost like 70Ã?Â´s  Yes backing a Jon Anderson solo album
(instead of Anderson rejoining 70Ã?Â´s Yes, get the difference?). So donÃ?Â´t expect long instrumental
passages or anything too different, nor explicit displays of virtuosity. Everything here works for the songs. Stolt was always heavily influenced by Steve Howe and it shows,
in a good way. In fact, the album sounds very fresh and exciting most of the time, with the
excellent backing band providing Anderson with a lush, symphonic and creative tapestry of sounds for
his unique voice. The first half of the CD is specially good, while for a time it seemed to me that
the second half dragged on a bit, but a few more spins IÃ?Â´m enjoying it all. This is surely a grower. <p>At least on studio, AndersonÃ?Â´s voice is in top form. Stolt takes a back seat here, providing
basically multi guitars parts that remind me of (who else?) Howe, but is still very much Stolt
himself, a brilliant and creative musician. In fact, keyboards, bass and everything else sounds like a mixture of classic Yes and early Flower Kings. The difference is that instead of Yes copycats, everything here turned out as a truthful, heartfelt homage to their heroes.  <p>As a whole I really loved this album. ItÃ?Â´s high on my top ten list for 2016, without any doubt. ItÃ?Â´s
nothing new, really, but itÃ?Â´s brilliant music anyway. Far and far superior than anything Yes has
done for a long, long time. If youÃ?Â´re a fan of them (and of Anderson in particular) youÃ?Â´ll be
delighted with Invention Of Knowledge. ItÃ?Â´s probably AndersonÃ?Â´s best solo album to date. And
probably the best Yes sounding record ever that was not played by Yes themselves. <p>Rating: 4.5 stars. Highly recommended!!</strong></strong></em></em>

Close up of brightly coloured flowers. Zoom back to get the sun beaming down from an azure sky with a few billowy 
cumulus clouds drifting by. Pan to the sparkling river and then pull back to include the full view with green hills and Jon 
Anderson standing in white robes with his arms held out to his sides, palms to the sky, head back, eyes closed and 
smiling. Now raise the view higher and begin revolving the camera around him while choirs sing, strings and wood winds 
play, some uplifting lead rock guitar, keyboards, emphatic percussion...<p><p>When Yes released "Fly from Here" in 2011, Jon Anderson was not to be just dropped at the side of the road. Though 
he'd suffered vocal troubles due to an illness, he soon teamed up with Yes alumni and long time friend Rick Wakeman to 
produce an album which to my ears was slow, sleepy, pretty, and offered little to captivate my ears. Anderson's vocals 
sounded frail and shaky. However, a couple of years back I read about how Anderson was enthusiastically writing new 
music in the spirit of Yes. So when I saw he had teamed up with Roine Stolt, I reckoned that this should be an album with 
some "adventurous music".<p><p>After the first listen, I wasn't sure what I'd heard. At least not in detail. The album sounded like one extended journey 
through Anderson Land, a sweeping ride through an world of Love, Light, Life, and Truth. Bright smiling faces, vivid 
colours to lighten the spirits, beams of light, everything and everyone simply radiant. It took three listens before I began to 
identify a song or two that stood apart, and a fifth listen with full attention to learn to recognize each song for some 
outstanding feature.<p><p>The songs here are essentially sweeping, uplifting, spiritual messages both lyrically and sonically. Anderson's vocals are 
lead and backing with a chorus of background vocals. Though Stolt is an accomplished lead vocalist with a distinct voice, 
he's not obvious here. The only times I notice that Roine Stolt is on the album at all is at the albums opening when the 
music resembles a Flower Kings song (and we know that the Flower Kings are inspired by Yes) and in a few places 
where the guitar sounds like Stolt's style. As for the other guest musicians, everyone is swept into the sparkling rainbow 
swirl that is Anderson Land. At times there are classic Yes-like moments with a cascade of bright synthesizer notes, some 
cheerful guitar chatter, or some conspicuously placed bass notes. Classic Yes it is not however with only a slight 
resemblance to "Tales from Topographic Oceans", "Relayer" or "Going for the One". I personally feel there's more 
similarity to "Magnification", "The Ladder" or even "Keys to Ascension", though notably different due to the absence of 
Maestros Howe, Wakeman, and Squire.<p><p>Some reasons that the music all seems at first to be part of the same spiritualized hippy fantasy nebula is because a 
number of songs segue into each other while the songs have a free-flowing structure, shifting to new melodies and 
themes within songs and sometimes drifting through gentle atmospheres or rising up to powerful crescendos. One never 
knows so readily if a song has shifted gears or if another has begun unless you're paying attention, which is not easy to 
do as it's easy to get drifting on a glowing cloud while watching cherubim and rainbow-horned unicorns dancing by. 
There's also the fact that some songs reprise the lyrics and accompanying melodies from other songs, so with your mind 
sailing through radiant beams of light and love, you might be excused for thinking that "Knowledge" is still "Invention".<p><p>Nevertheless, this is not a bad album by any means. If you can handle about 65 minutes of "Love and Light" lyrics about 
truth, holding Jon's hand, standing together, and the Spirit coming to you, you are eternal, etc., and Anderson Land theme 
music, then fans of the force behind Yes music and what inspires The Flower Kings should enjoy this. This is where Yes 
could have / might have been by now if Anderson had stayed on with them.<p><p>Or this is just where Jon Anderson has always been traveling toward. Three stars, four stars, five stars all possible. If 
there's a two star rating or two I wouldn't be completely surprised. But you can't deny the greatness of the effort that goes 
into making an album like this.</strong></strong></em></em>

Seemingly a match made in Prog heaven, `Invention of Knowledge' brings together two massive progressive rock icons in 
Roine Stolt and Yes' Jon Anderson, the two spiritually minded musicians (along with several additional notable prog guests) 
delivering what is easily the standout Symphonic Progressive work of 2016. This is really a meeting of two vintage prog-era 
players, because despite finding more personal status in prog circles with the Flower Kings in the Nineties onwards, Roine was 
one of the key musicians of Seventies Swedish symph-prog group Kaipa, playing on their first few albums. But despite one or 
two niggling issues discussed later, they've delivered a complex, ambitious and endlessly grand symphonic work that can 
easily be considered creative high-points in their already endlessly impressive careers.<p>Although Stolt and Anderson will deservedly receive all the attention, closer inspection behind the scenes reveals several 
other gifted musicians lending crucial musical contributions to this project. Jonas Reingold, no stranger to the Flower Kings as 
well as working with side-projects such as Karmakanic, Barracuda Triangle and the Tangent, is simply one of the most 
consistently impressive bass players currently active in modern prog circles, and as always, his inclusion pretty much makes 
this album an instant `must buy'. Fellow Karmakanic member and keyboard player Lalle Larsson has also delivered several 
outstanding solo albums worthy of investigation (especially his `Weaveworld' trilogy and solo piano disc `Until Never'), 
Michael Stolt, brother of Roine, is from an earlier version of the Flower Kings, and Feliz Lehrmann is the skilled latest drummer 
from their last few albums. The disc also includes some welcome backing vocals from the likes of Unifaun /Agents of Mercy 
singer Nad Sylvan and Pain of Salvation's Daniel Gildenlow amongst others, and keyboardist Tom Breslin will be familiar to 
many Yes followers, being the keyboard player on Yes' superb `Live Symphonic' DVD from 2002. Giving credit to these guests 
is important, for reasons mentioned later on.<p>Although early press-release comments compare the album in spirit to Yes' (perhaps!) defining classic `Tales from 
Topographic Oceans', this is not really the case very often here. It sounds more like the most dense Flower Kings album to 
date without the flashy soloing given an extremely vocal-heavy fronting by Anderson, so fans of both those groups should be 
quite at home here. Although comprised of nine tracks, most of the sixty-five minute album is divided into four multi-part 
pieces. Stolt is no stranger to lengthy compositions in any of his music, and considering the complexity of the album, all of the 
transitions between passages here are seamless and natural, with plenty of constant clever reprises that slyly return before 
you even know you're back again! Symphonic themes with plenty of organ, whirring synths and tasty guitar solos rising into 
the heavens constantly weave in and out of the entire disc, and the sound of Stolt's soloing will be instantly noticeable to 
Flower Kings and Transatlantic fans, but thankfully he never resorts to aping the tone of Yes' Steve Howe in an attempt to 
make this sound more `Yes-like'.<p>But the album pretty much belongs to Jon Anderson (with Stolt surrendering all vocal duties to his more famous counterpart), 
and to his credit, he hasn't sounded so relaxed, inspired and varied in decades. Jon completely drives the course of the album 
with his distinctive breezy, hopeful and embracing lead voice, but also surprises with some exquisite multi-part harmonies 
that seem to hover in the air around the listener, and he leaves Stolt to craft these weighty majestic passages to hold his new 
age proclamations and spiritual musings. Plenty of passages see the two musicians successfully gelling and complimenting 
each-other perfectly, others sometimes come across as if Anderson's gems of belief are added on top afterwards, but most of 
the time the album is surprisingly and consistently cohesive. It's also a welcome relief to find that `Invention of Knowledge' is 
hardly commercial or (gulp!) AOR-driven, something that many of the older prog-related musicians depressingly resort to!<p>As for the music itself, the three-part LP side-long length title-track is full of stirring orchestration and victorious chimes, 
Anderson's voice impossibly pretty and announcing with plenty of rumbling drums, chunky bass spasms, strains of sitar and 
regal synth veils, Stolt delivering everything from drowsy slide guitar, reflective slow-burn wisps and scorching quick little 
bursts. The uplifting melody in the opening minutes of the two-part `Knowing' is one of the loveliest moments of the disc with 
intricate vocal arrangements over commanding organ, piano ringing through and booming symphonic bluster breaking out, 
and this eighteen-minute track perhaps drifts the closest to Jon's old band, with an almost `Awaken'-like quality in the 
dreamier spots. "Faith to the real salvation life" Jon offers on the sweetly romantic and reassuring three-part `Everybody 
Heals', with some crisp soaring guitar runs ringing through from Stolt and very welcome brisk jazzy piano races. `Know...' is 
simpler and stripped back, floating gracefully and triumphantly, containing some of the only longer instrumental moments of 
the disc which thankfully allow all the players to shine brightly, and a final reprise of themes from `Knowing' bring a satisfying 
sense of closure.<p>But it all comes down to this - How much you enjoy this album may depend on exactly what Jon Anderson personally means 
to you, because, make no mistake, this whole album is completely geared around his personality, word view and spiritual 
beliefs. To many, he is in the heart and spirit of true Yes, so many will adopt this as `the best and most true Yes album since 
(for instance) `Going for the One', but the truth is - this album sounds nothing like Yes. Nor is it an experimental loopy tour-
de-force like his `Olias of Sunhillow' solo album was, yet `Invention of Knowledge', whilst sounding nothing like that one 
either, is absolutely the most complex and dynamic prog-related work he's been involved with since that landmark distinctive 
release.<p>If you're one of those more easy-going Yes fans that believe Anderson CAN be a wonderful ingredient to making up the 
beautiful music of Yes, but are just as thrilled by Steve Howe's fiery guitar runs or Chris Squire's upfront chugging bass, then 
this album will make you very aware of what's missing - longer instrumental passages. `Invention of Knowledge' boasts some 
exceptional players providing endless progressive-music colour and skill to the arrangements, but they're almost constantly 
pushed behind Anderson's airy vocals. There's fleeting little instrumental breaks of 30 seconds or so here and there, but then 
it's right back to more vocals, and unless you are simply the biggest Anderson fan-boy in the world (which is not actually a 
slight in any way), this can become very tiresome over the course of an album than runs over an hour. Of course, it's natural 
with an icon of the genre such as Anderson that he's going to be a main attraction to the work and it makes sense to have him 
constantly front and center, but it kind of short-changes the contributions of some fine musicians who deserve to given more 
attention in undistracted showcase opportunities, that you have to sometimes strain to hear in the background beneath the 
endless vocal trickery.<p>But in the end, it's still a joyous triumph of progressive music that doesn't merely remain lazily vintage-flavoured or resort to 
tiredly remaking the sounds of the classic bands of the style. `Invention of Knowledge' is impeccably performed and 
produced, is lyrically, vocally and musically utterly convincing, even sometimes a little overwhelming, but holding true magic in 
several standout spots. It should have provided more interludes of longer purely instrumental sections to break up all the 
vocal flamboyance, but it's no doubt going to remain the biggest symphonic prog moment of the year that lovers of that 
grandest of prog-rock styles will absolutely adore to bits. Now let's see if the Anderson/Stolt project is going to become a 
recurring concern or the iconic pair will just leave us with this one teasing masterwork!<p>Four stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

<strong>The remembering</strong><p>Jon Anderson is one of the more prolific members of the Yes family tree with a large number of solo albums 
and also several collaborations with other artists over the years, for example with Vangelis in 80's and more 
recently with fellow Yes man Rick Wakeman and with Fusion violinist Jean-Luc Ponty in the Anderson Ponty 
Band. The present album is a collaboration with Swedish musician Roine Stolt. I was previously familiar with 
Stolt from Transatlantic and I also saw him live with Steve Hackett's band recently.<p>The Invention Of Knowledge is a vocally driven album, and Jon's vocals are almost constantly to the 
forefront. His voice sounds very well indeed, better than on other recent releases. The style is what I would 
like to call "soft progressive Rock". A reasonable comparison in terms of the style here could be to Open, a 
digital only release from Jon which consists of one 20 plus minute epic piece of symphonic music. Anderson/Stolt is not similar to Yes music, but the closest you get is probably on Tales From Topographic 
Oceans. The mood of The Invention Of Knowledge is almost constantly uplifting and bright and even 
though the music is thoroughly pleasant and enjoyable, it is not very challenging. I feel that it never really 
truly gets off the ground and with a running time of over an hour, it tends to get a bit samey at points.  <p>I like The Invention Of Knowledge. Indeed, I think it is better than most of Jon's solo albums and I would say 
it is one of his best non-Yes releases. It is well worth having certainly, and a nice listen, but I do not find it 
terribly impressive.

Wow, a collaboration of Roine Stolt of The Flower Kings and Jon Anderson of Yes! How exciting to see the old school 
and the not-so-old school (Roine will be 60 later in 2016) working together! Or is it?? That's the question my mind 
pondered as I fell asleep multiple times while listening to this. Or perhaps the meaning of this music is simply above 
the ability of my brain to comprehend? Like it was intended for spirits in another dimension to listen to and maybe 
humans simply have not evolved (at least in my case) enough to understand Anderson's enlightened gibberish.<p>Let's get the first thing everyone wants to know out of the way. Does it sound like the Flower Kings? No. Does it sound 
like Yes? Barely. What does it sound like? It sounds like the plodding, slow-moving, new age music Anderson has 
featured on many of his solo albums (Olias of Sunhillow is one reference point), with an occasional Howe-like nod 
from Stolt. There really is no prog rock workout here. It plods along at the same speed for over an hour, occasionally 
reaching minor crescendos in places. The music is by no means simple either. It has some complexity to it in an almost 
orchestral fashion. And with musicians such as Lalle Larsson, Jonas Reingold, Tom Brislin, and Felix Lehrmann at their 
disposal, I'm shocked that there wasn't anything worthy enough to provide the "rock" portion of prog rock. The entire 
album had this folky, new age vibe running throughout; a never-ending "sameness."<p>Now, maybe there were some interesting instrumental things going on, but they were lost on my ears from the 
incessant wordiness of this album. Anderson's vocals are nice, but they are forced way above the rest of the mix and 
there are few moments on the album where he isn't singing. I never imagined Anderson's vocals being "too much" for 
an album until now.<p>I can't really comment on the lyrics much as I don't understand them (as I suspect most humans that haven't reached 
whatever world Jon lives in). There is much repetition, but that still doesn't help me understand them either. I would 
have better luck understanding the output of a random word generator than this gibberish.<p>Fans of Anderson's solo career will probably like this; maybe Yes fans that like the softer, sleepier side of Yes. Fans of 
gibberish will also enjoy this. If you want the rock equation of prog rock, look elsewhere.</strong></strong></em></em>

The prolific Jon Anderson has been quite a busy man lately, having recovered from illness with a new found energy 
and passion, a trait that disproves the long held misconception that rock music is the governance of the young and 
only the young. Beyond 71 years of age, he continues to voyage into unfamiliar territories such as his long delayed 
cooperation with Jean-Luc Ponty, a thoroughly successful venture that yielded the aptly named 'Better Late than 
Never' album and subsequent well-applauded tour.  Here, he has teamed up with Swedish mastermind Roine Stolt 
of the Flower Kings and Transatlantic fame, to create a very Yes-like opus that proves only that the creative juices 
that inspired him in the glory days of progressive rock, still has a resonating voice and audience today. Sadly, the 
judgmental universe that we now live in will give way to some unfair and foolish criticism from shameless 
detractors who need to fuel their pill-fed apathy (to stay awake at the keyboard at the very least) by puncturing this 
symphonic opus with brazen detritus. Well, like they say at the hardware store: screw them! If you no like, move the 
hell on! <p>Gathering a rather stellar crew of familiar faces from both the FK, such as bassist extraordinaire Jonas Reingold, 
drummer Felix Lehrmann and former FK bassman Michael Stolt) and from the Yes side, Tom Brislin, whilst including 
the supremely talented Swedish keyboardist Lalle Larsson, the two protagonists certainly have aimed precisely at 
what they wanted to achieve, a classic sounding Progressive Rock album.  Both Anderson and Stolt have never 
sounded better and more confident, and truth be said, you can hear the enthusiasm displayed throughout. Let us 
be honest first of all, this collaboration has more musical width and breath than anything spewed by Yes since , my 
goodness' since Relayer! <p>That being said, the nine tracks do flow into one another rather seamlessly, a very linear sounding series of 
arrangements within each piece that get busy one moment and quite atmospheric the next, as on the end of 
'Knowledge', where the swirling effects really take hold. As with the Ponty collaboration, the music is totally 
uplifting, spirited if not necessarily overtly spiritual, spiced by occasional bursts of energetic gusto and dazzling 
playing by all instrumentalists. Roine can carve with the best of them, a talented guitarist who can infuse a variety 
of styles that span the gamut of influences, from Howe, Hackett and Gilmour to more oblique talents such as Allan 
Holdsworth. He can play fast, controlled and delirious when prompted. While Squire has always been a giant, Reingold is one hell of a player, seeing him live seals the deal. A monster.  <p>I also cannot help noticing that three songs contain the sound NO (as opposed to'Yes) in Know, Knowledge and Knowing. Coincidence? Nah, must be my meds. Yeah, I know (no). In fact, all the titles have a positive spin and message. Eat that Steve Wilson! <p>The glorious track 'Knowing' is an 11 minute celestial epic that reeks the most of 'Close to the Edge', owner of a 
skilled melody and some complex orchestrations, Lalle's divine grand piano, screeching synth swirls and a fully 
determined vocal performance that is easily among the very best ever captured by a microphone.  The two follow 
up pieces 'Chase & Harmony' and 'Everybody Heals' are equally masterful expressions of musical craftsmanship 
and passionate delivery. Shorter ditties offer hope and salvation, 'Better by Far' and 'Golden Light', a lovely 
diversion that goes straight to the owner of lonely Heartstrings and pulls on them delicately. The jazzy, windswept 
and airy 'Know' is an 11 minute tropical paradise of topographic ocean breezes, Jon's voice a warm zephyr that 
soothes the soul and medicates the mind, a beach with grandiose piano, shuffling bass, brushed cymbals and a laid 
back, laissez-faire attitude. 'An answer to a promise that delivered you' as Roine swirls his guitar like Carlos 
Santana. Totally delicious.  <p>I enjoyed the whole enchilada, an album that will need made more listens and new details to discover, so dense this 
is. I was expecting something a bit lamer I guess and I was wrong. The cover artwork, booklet and inlay are truly 
first-class and worth the eye candy. <p>4.5 Devices of Awareness

2016 finds a certain Prog God in marvellously rude health and top form. The aforesaid award for Jon Anderson was, 
in my opinion, thoroughly well deserved. There is a tour, long promised, with fellow Yes cohorts Trevor Rabin and 
Rick Wakeman, which, to all accounts, seems to have been extremely well received. And, to start off the year, this 
collaboration with Roine Stolt, he of Flower Kings fame, with more than a little contributed by a stellar backing band, 
including the marvellous Jonas Reingold, Stolt's Kings collaborator on bass, and the wonderful Tom Brislin on keys 
(whose piano work especially on Chase and Harmony is clear and uplifting), this marking a return to working with 
Anderson.<p>The album was created over the Internet, Anderson's preferred method of recording, with vocals and musical ideas 
and compositions sent to each protagonist over the ether. The idea started when Stolt and the Transatlantic boys 
had Anderson singing Yes classics with them on one of those prog cruise trips which are in vogue at the moment. <p>Structurally, the album is, understandably, an attempt to recreate the feel of Yes classics from the Topographic 
symphonic heyday, although, perhaps more than many others who have commented on the album, I feel that Stolt 
and his unique Flower Kings sound and feel is also stamped over the work. It is not a collection of songs, as such, 
but a group of suites joining together to segue into a whole body of work. I also think that the Topographic 
comparison was, in reality, a clever marketing ploy to bring us classic Yes fans on board. They needn't have 
bothered, because the album stands up more than well enough on its own as a symphony of modern progressive 
rock, utilising the latest technology and loving production to bring a vision to life.<p>Does it work? Undeniably, yes. Those who do not buy in to Anderson's mystical view of life, the universe, and 
everything, will probably not be converted by this, because it is very much his lyrical creation, in keeping with many 
of his better solo albums. I do buy into this, so it is not a problem for me.<p>For the first few listens, in fact, you do feel that he is in danger of drowning out the music lyrically and vocally. It is 
not the case, however, when you become familiar with the album and allow it to wash over and influence you, for 
example allowing the sheer lifting beauty of We Are Truth, with Anderson sounding better than he has in years, 
accompanied by a choral backdrop, and the most beautiful soaring symphonic noise, extremely reminiscent of 
Stardust We Are period Kings (Knowing, by the way, could easily have fitted on that exceptional album), then you 
know that what you have here is classic progressive rock played by its leading proponents, classic and modern.<p>Listen to the orchestration on Everyone Heals, and then recoil at the power of Stolt's riff, before Anderson 
introduces the vocal with a fragile power one thought had been lost to us forever.<p>Some of Stolt's guitar work really is to be treasured (the delicate sounds produced on Knowledge with the sounds of 
the ocean waves lapping over it are simply wonderful), and Reingold has his fret fingers working as if it is the last 
thing he will ever do, and wants to go out on a high.<p>Both of them have promoted this album with vigour, and it quite clearly is a work of some importance to them. I 
heard Anderson on BBC Radio on more than one occasion, and he is clearly revelling in the autumn of his career. 
Given that it is only a few years since he almost died, I thank God that he has survived to carry on his musical legacy 
to the world. I also wonder what would have been had Squire and Howe showed just a little bit more patience, and 
allowed him the recovery time he needed, because one thing is for sure. This is a far better, rounded, and genuine 
"Yes" album than the debacle that was Heaven and Earth, or Fly From Here, as much as I enjoyed the suite on the 
latter.<p>This is an excellent album, which all lovers of genuine symphonic prog will want to own. For the PA rating system, 
four stars, but 4.5 if we had such a rating. I, for one, would like to see this collaboration continue to see where it 
takes them. To the stars, I think!</strong></strong></em></em>

Back in the 1980s, Jon Anderson was invited to sing in what was to become that decade's version of Yes.  Along with Chris Squire 
and Alan White, as well as Yes alumnus Tony Kaye, and driven by Trevor Rabin, this version of the band played a much more pop 
driven style, dancing around the fringes of prog.  But Anderson was not completely content with that.  He eventually assembled 
old friends Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe and Bill Bruford into a more traditional Yes-sounding band.<p>More recently, during an extended bout with illness, Anderson asked the Yes of that day for a break from touring.  Instead of 
either putting Yes on hiatus, or finding a temporary replacement singer, the group unceremoniously fired him.  In the years 
since, Yes has recorded two fair, but mostly unremarkable albums with two different replacement singers.  While these albums 
again have hints of that old Yes spark, they are missing some key ingredients of what Yes was about.<p>Joining up now with Roine Stolt and a band of Stolt's cohorts, Anderson has now proven that he is the keeper of the soul of Yes.<p>Their first (I do hope this band continues) album is an inspired suite of four linked songs, split into nine movements, with 
underlying themes, lyrically and musically, that weave throughout the album.  It is an uplifting, spiritual piece that sound more 
like Yes than anything the present members of the group have come up with.<p>I compare this album favorably with "Tales From Topographic Oceans", another full-album concept piece.<p>Stolt takes care to deliver the Yes sound, crafting his guitar to simulate Howe's unique technique, both in phrasing and tone.  
And both bass players that perform here, Jonas Reingold and Michael Stolt, do a fine approximation of Chris Squire's 
outstanding melodic bass lines. <p>Anderson's lyrics are in the classic Yes vein, positive and spiritual, without focusing on any particular religion or dogma.<p>On the whole, this album revives the Yes experience better than anything any of the members have released in decades.  If I 
could give any advice to the remaining Yes, it's "Do whatever you can to get Anderson back!!!!"</strong></strong></em></em>

Tales From Soporific Oceans...<p>On paper it couldn't miss: a collaboration between YES icon Jon Anderson and guitarist Roine Stolt
of THE FLOWER KINGS, in a return to the sort of long-form Symphonic Rock not heard from Anderson in
decades. The finished album was advertised (in a big sticker smack-dab on the CD cover) as "new
music in the spirit of early works such as Tales From Topographic Oceans & Olias of Sunhillow"
...strictly sales talk, but the comparison caught on, in a textbook model of autosuggestion.<p>Reviews so far have been glowing, enough to warrant a dissenting opinion. And here it is, from a
reluctant spoilsport old enough to recall when the music of Jon Anderson and Yes really did strive
toward "The Revealing Science of God".<p>As a bridge uniting two generations of Progressive Rock, the new album is built of flimsy stuff. The
original "Topographic Oceans", keep in mind, found its genesis in the ancient Hindu shastras
described by Paramahansa Yogananda in his autobiography, famously introduced to Anderson by maverick
King Crimson percussionist Jamie Muir. "Invention of Knowledge", in contrast, was born poolside
aboard a luxury Prog Rock cruise ship sailing the Caribbean, with free food, fine drinks, and a
casino belowdecks.<p>The so-called collaboration was ersatz from the start. Jon Anderson would email ideas to Sweden,
where Stolt force-fit them onto older, unreleased music of his own before sending them back to
California for more amendments (and still more lyrics) by Anderson, working alone on his home studio
computer. The only time the two were actually in the same room was during a promotional photo shoot.<p>All a sign of the times, in this Brave New World of web-linked music production. But still a lousy
way to write and record an album. It's no wonder the outcome resembled a lesser Flower Kings effort,
featuring a celebrity guest vocalist who sounds like he wandered into the studio by chance and began
singing about Ley lines before anyone could stop him.<p>Maybe Stolt was reluctant to assert himself over material developed (suggested, really) by an
obvious idol. We could have then been spared this tepid collection of uninspired soft-prog,
certainly effective in spots, but with a numbing uniformity in tone and tempo over its 65-minute
length. Olias of Sunhillow? Try Olias of Sleepy Hollow instead...<p>Mine is a minority opinion, to be sure. But no way is the album worthy of comparison to classic
Prog, sounding to this Grinch more like something the Whos of Whoville would sing while carving
their holiday roast beast. Quoting Jon Anderson himself, from an earlier and more enlightened age of
Progressive expression: What happened / To wonders / We once knew so well?</strong></strong></em></em>

I think my ears got cavities listening to this over the past week. Jon Anderson and Roine Stolt certainly seem like a 
match made in Heaven when it comes to their philosophies on life and so I wasn't too surprised to hear that this is a 
wordy album. I'm not sure if it's a concept album but it comes across that way to me with the focus on the lyrics over 
the instrumental work and compositions. They need to get the story across at any costs which is why I usually am not 
into the concept record. This at the very least is a themed album where Jon and Roine spread their flowers and love 
upon us in the YES/THE FLOWER KINGS tradition.<p> Jon's voice is in great form on here which was my biggest take 
away. I admit to having nothing to do with YES or Anderson post 80's and for good reason but he clearly was into 
singing these words. Instrumentally it's the bass that impressed me not surprisingly with Michael Stolt doing that and 
taurus bass pedals but Jonas Reingold is also here and he's a beast man. Roine comes to the fore with his familiar 
sounding guitar but again this is a vocal driven album where everything else takes a back seat. I do like how some 
songs blend into the next one over the 65 minutes and nine tracks.<p> The fourth track "Knowledge" is where we first 
get some instrumental authority with the organ helping out and it's interesting that less than half way through this 
track it becomes calm and stays that way to the end. There is a fair amount of piano on this record leading the way 
and they do contrast and repeat themes a lot. Jon says this is not progressive rock but progressive music. The closer 
"Know" is the longest at over 11 minutes and during the first half I kept thinking they had a guest female singer but 
nope that's Jon. The album ends with those piano melodies.<p> I liked this more than I thought I would but without 
question in my music world this is not close to a 4 star record. </strong></strong></em></em>

                                   Review Nº 712<p>As a teenage prog fan I was privileged to have listen and buying many of the classic albums during the early 70's. 
My passion for the genre waned however during the 80's, and it wasn't until the mid of the 90's and the 
emergence of band's like Glass Hammer, Spock's Beard and The Flower Kings, fronted by Roine Stolt, that my 
interest was rekindled. Somehow they captured and revitalised the sound and the spirit of the early 70's, whilst 
retaining their own identity.<p>However, my personal tastes have shifted towards to a darker and heavier music in the past years, in part due 
to the influences of my two sons. Still, I've always kept in constant contact with my musical roots, namely Yes, 
King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Camel, Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Van Der Graaf 
Generator, the bands that have had the longest and greatest impact during my lifetime, since my teenage 
beginning until these days.<p>Anderson and Stolt are two prog musicians that began their musical career in the 70's. Anderson is best known 
as the lead singer of the prog rock band Yes, which he co-founded in 1968 with bassist Chris Squire. He was a 
member of the band across three tenures between 1968 and 2008. Many consider him as the soul of Yes. He is 
also noted for his solo career and collaborations with some artists, including Vangelis, Roine Stolt and Jean-Luc 
Ponty. He has also appeared on albums of King Crimson, Tangerine Dream, Iron Butterfly, Mike Oldfield and 
Glass Hammer. Stolt is a Swedish guitarist, vocalist and composer. He is a major figure in the Sweden's prog rock 
history. Many consider him as the father of the Swedish prog rock. He was in two of his country's most 
successful prog rock bands, Kaipa in the 70's and The Flower Kings in the 90's. He has collaborated with other 
prog artists, participating in many other prog projects.<p>It was in that context that "Invention Of Knowledge" falls. Still and despite so many years of career of both, 
Anderson and Stolt were never together in the studio. In fact, the two met only twice. Anderson sent music to 
Stolt, including those he had worked with some of his other musical contacts years before. Anderson and Stolt 
continued to develop the original ideas via Internet, and in 2015, Stolt then put together a high class ensemble 
that recorded the music.<p>When we heard that two legendary figures of prog rock, the ex-Yes vocalist Anderson, and Stolt of The Flower 
Kings, Transatlantic, and Kaipa, would be joining together to create an album, expectations were indeed quite 
high. Thankfully, the duo didn't frustrated all those expectations, as their initial recording together, "Invention Of 
Knowledge", brings together all the elements of what we love about all the classic acts they have each been 
involved with over the years.<p>The music contained on "Invention Of Knowledge" is melodic symphonic prog rock music, filled with grand 
sweeping arrangements that allow Anderson his still enchanting vocal delivery. Stolt with his tasty guitar playing 
is great, at times seeming to pay tribute to the legendary Steve Howe. The album sounds like a meeting of Yes 
and The Flower Kings, but I don't think any of us expected anything otherwise, really. Much of "Invention Of 
Knowledge" has an epic, long form broadness that isn't unlike "Tales From Topographic Oceans" or some of The 
Flower Kings more grandiose releases such as "Unfold The Future" or "The Sum Of No Evil". The opening three 
part title suite is a perfect example of that, chock full of majestic arrangements that allow Stolt's nimble guitar 
lines to weave and battle with quirky keyboard tapestries, all while Anderson's pixie melodies grab the listener 
by the heart. "Knowing" has a more "Going For The One" feel, with a catchy melody that will instantly grab you 
much like "Wonderous Stories" did all those years ago, but at over 10 minutes long, of course it leaves plenty of 
room for alluring guitar solos, sumptuous keyboards, and some few lead seductive bass lines. The charming 
"Chase And Harmony" combines lush, pastoral sections with moments of symphonic, almost classical 
orchestrations, Stolt's guitar work at times captures the majesty of Brian May, while the emotional three part 
"Everybody Heals" suite contains some lovely Anderson's lead vocals supported by rich backing vocals and 
gorgeous piano and synthesizer works, with Stolt also dropping in a few inspired lead guitar solos. The closing 
number "Know..." pushes past the 11minute timeframe and is easily the most pastoral track here on "Invention 
Of Knowledge", filled with drifting keyboard washes, melodic guitar leads, and some Anderson's great vocal 
passages.<p>Conclusion: If you are a bit disappointed by the most recent Yes' offering, I urge you to give "Invention Of 
Knowledge" a try. You might be pleasantly surprised. "Invention Of Knowledge" maybe falls short of perfection, 
but this is prog personified and it's easily one of the strongest progressive rock albums released in the last years 
by the classic prog generation. It might sounds to you too much close to "Tales From Topographic Oceans" or to 
"Olias Of Sunhillow", but I don't care. I still love both albums. This is a majestic epic prog album, hand crafted by 
two of the legendary masters of the genre. Get your copy of this beautiful piece and thank you Anderson and 
Stolt for sharing this great music with us.<p>Prog is my Ferrari. Jem Godfrey (Frost*)</strong></strong></em></em>

"Invention of Knowledge" is the debut full-length studio album by multi-national progressive rock act Anderson/Stolt. The album was released through InsideOutMusic in June 2016. The duo lineup consists of former Yes vocalist Jon Anderson (lead and backing vocals, synthesiser, percussion) and The Flower Kings guitarist/frontman Roine Stolt (electric guitar, acoustic guitars, Dobro, Portuguese guitar, lap steel guitar, keyboards, percussion, backing vocals). Several session musicians also play and sing backing vocals/choirs on the album. Anderson/Stolt was formed in 2014 after Stolt had played as part of the backing band for Jon Anderson on a progressive rock-themed cruise. InsideOutMusic label owner Thomas Waber promised that he would provide the funding for the project, if the two musicians would agree to work together. <p>Stylistically this sounds pretty much like I expected it to sound. A Flower Kings related project but with Jon Anderson on vocals. "Invention of Knowledge" features four long tracks, which are for the most part subdivided into shorter tracks. So there is compositional complexity here which isn´t something new for neither Anderson nor Stolt. It´s definitely not an album which challenges the duo or their fans in terms of sounding vastly different from what you expect a a hybrid Yes/The Flower Kings project to sound like. Anderson has a unique voice and delivery, and when he sings you instantly know that it´s him singing. His uplifting and positive lyrics are also a trademark by now. Stolt has arranged most of the material and written most of the instrumental parts and it´s impossible not to notice his signature writing style gracing the album.<p>"Invention of Knowledge" is well produced featuring a clear, organic, and detailed sounding production job, and just like anything else about this release it´s no surprise since Stolt is responsible for the production work. So "Invention of Knowledge" is arguably a high quality progressive rock album created by two prolific veterans of the scene, but when that is said It would have been nice to hear the duo try something new and not make an album which sounds like The Flower Kings with Anderson singing. That part is slightly disappointing, but "Invention of Knowledge" is still an enjoyable listen and a 3.5 star (70%) rating is deserved.</strong></strong></em></em>
