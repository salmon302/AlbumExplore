  "country": "United States",
  "biography": "Death biography\n\nFounded in   Orlando, USA in 1983 (as MANTAS) - Renamed in 1984 - Disbanded in 1998\n\nChuck Schuldiner founded Death in the early 80s as an extreme metal band, not knowing that in the years to come the band would be celebrated by many as the band which created the genre of Death Metal. During the years the lineup changed frequently, with Schuldiner as the constant element. Their music got more and more complex in the 90s, and their last releases Individual Thought Patterns, Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance are the reason for their inclusion in the archives. The music on these albums is what is today often referred to as \"Progressive Death Metal\", and it influenced many other bands in the following years which further explored the possibilities of this new kind of music. Eventually Schuldiner founded the band Control Denied, which essentially continued Death's evolution towards a more experimental music - their first release is very similar to Death, minus the typical Death Metal vocals. After the release of that album in 1999 Schuldiner was diagnosed with brain-stem cancer, and due to this disease both Control Denied and Death were put on hold, and in 2001 Schuldiner lost his battle with his illness.\n\nWhy this artist must be listed in www.progarchives.com :\n\nDeath can be seen as the founding fathers of two genres: Death Metal and Progressive Death Metal. While their first 4 studio are not progressive, the remaining 3 show an amazing development of more and more experimental structures.\n\nSee also: -\n\nControl Denied",
