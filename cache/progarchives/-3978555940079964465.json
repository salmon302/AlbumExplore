  "name": "MILES DAVIS",
  "genre": "Jazz Rock/Fusion",
  "country": "United States",
  "biography": "Miles Dewey Davis III - May 26, 1926 (Alton, Illinois, US) - September 28, 1991\n\nMiles Davis was not only a gifted musician (trumpet and composition) but also a major artist of the twentieth century. He was in a constant search for new forms of expression. Having been a painter himself, and not unlike Pablo Picasso he tried to renew himself in all periods of his life. He played on various early bebop records, recorded one of the first cool jazz records, developped  modal jazz, and was a pioneer in jazz rock . Only a few musicians have mastered like him to shape new forms and set aesthetic milestones.\n\nThe \"electric\" period of Miles Davis started in 1969 and ended in1975 when Miles retired due to health problems until the end of the seventies. In these years Miles distributed an important part to jazz rock. Columbia released  four studio records 'In a silent way'(1969), 'Bitches Brew' (1970), 'A tribute to Jack Johnson' (1970), 'On the Corner' (1972) and an important  number of live records (some released on vinyl only in Japan) :  'Black Beauty'/Live at the Fillmore West (1970), 'Live-Evil' (1970), 'Dark Magus' (1974) 'Agharta' (1975), 'Pangaea' (1975). A great part of the studio tracks recorded during these years were only released in the second half of the 70's and first half of the 80's on various compilations.\n\nBeginning with 'In a silent way' Miles used mainly riffs or short segments and more often just simple rhythmic figures that would serve as a base for collective improvisation. At the same time the rhythmic changed from tertiary jazz rhythm to binary rock rhythm. Guitarist John Mc Laughlin became one of the key elements of the electric Miles sound. Influenced by Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles, Miles Davis used during this period for the first time new studio techniques, new electronic instruments (among them the Fender Rhodes electric piano) and new sound devices, (Miles would use heavily the Wah-Wah pedal, popularized by Hendrix) to enlarge the sound spectrum of his music. Miles was among the first musicians to realize the full potential of modern recording studios. He and his longtime producer Teo Macero recorded non-stop whole sessions, with the intention to choose and assemble the material afterwards. They would use this technique in an extensive way, especially on 'Bitches Brew', creating musical \"puzzles\" through multiple edits, up to a point where the original tracks are barely recognizable. ('Pharaoh's Dance'on Bitches Brew contained nineteen edits, including the use of tape loops, reverb & echo chambers).\n\nIn 1975 Miles took a five year break due to health problems. When he returned in the beginning of the eighties on the musical scene he oriented his music towards funk fusion:  'Decoy' (1983/1984),'You're Under Arrest' (1984/1985). In 1985 Miles changed after  thirty years  from CBS to Warner and started a collaboration with bassist Marcus Miller resulting in  the 1986 record 'Tutu'. Miles continued to record and tour until his death in September 1991.\n\n===Martin 'Alucard' Horst=== (Thanx to Micky for inspiration!)\n\nSelected discography:\n\n-Birth of the Cool (1949/1950)\n\n-Miles Davis Volume 1&2 (1952-1954)\n\n-'Round About Midnight (1955-1956)\n\n-Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet (1956)\n\n-Milestones (1958)\n\n-Kind of Blue (1959)\n\n-Sketches of Spain (1960)\n\n-My Funny Valentine (1964)\n\n-E.S.P (1965)\n\n-Miles Smiles (1966)\n\n-In a Silent Way (1969)\n\n-Bitches Brew (1969)\n\n-A Tribute to Jack Johnson (1970)\n\n-Live-Evil (1970)\n\n-On the Corner (1972)\n\n-Pangaea (1975)\n\n-Decoy (1983/1984)\n\n-You're Under Arrest (1984/1985)\n\n-Tutu (1986)",
