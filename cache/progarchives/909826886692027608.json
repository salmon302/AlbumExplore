  "country": "Brazil",
  "biography": "Bacamarte biography\n\nFounded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1974 - Disbanded in 1984 - Regrouped Live  in 2012 and 2014\n\nThis was a Brazilian septet including Mario Neto (guitar/vocals), Sergio Villarim (keyboards), Delto Simas (bass), Marco Ver\ufffdssimo (drums), Marcus Moura (flute/accordion), Mr. Paul (percussion) and Jane Duboc (vocals). A rich and symphonic music with wonderful keyboards and a very nice flute which enlightens the compositions full of interest and detours. A few female vocal interventions complete to enrich this great work. The band surpasses their influences: LOCANDA DEL FATE, PFM, QUELLA VECCHIA LOCANDA and ILLUSION.\n\nThey made two albums entitled \"Depois Do Fim\" ('83) and \"Sete Cidades\" ('99). In '95 Rarity Records released their first LP on CD with the addition of a bonus track (due to appear in their second LP). The CD \"Depois Do Fim\" is one of the highlights of the South-American Prog rock: a compelling blend of varied keyboards (vintage synthesizers, strings, piano, organ), skillful acoustic and electric guitar and strong Portuguese vocals. The nine compositions (four instrumental) sound warm and elaborate with many changing atmospheres. I'm mostly impressed by Mario Neto's alternating guitar play: from powerful and howling electric guitar to a slight Andalusian touch and classical like JOHN WILLIAMS (Sky-era) or using the tremolo-technique on the Spanish guitar (like \"Recuerdos de la Alhambra\" from TARREGA). Not to be missed by any serious Prog rock aficionado!\n\n: : : Erik Neuteboom, The NETHERLANDS\n\nFan & official Prog Archives collaborator\n\nSee also:\n\nHERE",
