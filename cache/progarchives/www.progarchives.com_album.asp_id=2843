It's no secret that this album, recorded and released at the end of 1972 polarized the 
band. It brought a temporary end to NEW TROLLS. The reason was guitarist Vittorio de 
Scalzi wanted to continue the eclectic route of NEW TROLLS and the other guitarist 
(and vocalist) Nico di Palo favored a hard rock approach. And because of that, the 
group split, with Nico di Palo forming a group that would become Ibis, and Vittorio de 
Scalzi, with some legal problems wanting to continue the NEW TROLLS name, had to 
continue on as N.T. ATOMIC SYSTEM.  UT brought in keyboardist Maurizio Salvi, who 
would hop on to Ibis (in which he was responsible for the wonderful keyboard work to  
Sun Supreme). <p>Many people regard  "UT" as the high point of the TROLLS career, others call it an 
uneven mess with some fantastic material and tedious material. I really hadn't notice 
that problem myself. "Studio" is a classically-influenced piece dominated by piano (there 
was a short part that almost resembled the opening part of GENESIS' "The Lamb Lies 
Down on Broadway", and that album wouldn't be seen until November 1974), 
while "XXII Strada" tends to be a more jazzy. I have felt that "I Cavalieri del Lago 
Dell'ontario" was one of the album's high points, starting off with a marching beat, but 
getting in to a wonderful prog groove. I never felt the next piece, "Storia di una Foglia" 
was particularly progressive, but it's still a nice folk/pop-influenced piece. "Nato Adesso" 
starts off as a wonderful piano-oriented ballad with the Eminent 310 model organ 
(which is capable of string synth sounds, which the best known use was on Jean Michel 
Jarre's "Oxygene", and the basis for the Solina and its American counterpart, the ARP 
String Ensemble). The song then gets in to an extended guitar solo. The complaint 
leveled here is the extended guitar solo, but I didn't find it any more a problem than the 
extended organ solos you find on Le ORME's "Collage" (which I find a particularly 
underrated album). "C'è Troppe Guerra" is far more heavy than I'm used to on a NEW 
TROLLS album, in fact it sounds more like heavy metal. I remember years ago someone 
comparing this to BLACK SABBATH, I can't necessarily disagree there, except even 
more aggressive (hard to believe). Some of the vocal passages seem unnecessarily 
somber and out of place to the mainly loud and aggressive passages. The last two cuts 
are pretty much give or take, pretty much in ballad form with "Paolo e Francesca" 
and "Chi Mi Può Capire", they aren't bad but not remarkable. But the great stuff is 
totally killer, and the stuff that many accuse of being tedious doesn't seem that tedious 
to me. But the music is well produced (something you can't always say of other great 
Italian prog acts like BIGLIETTO PER L'INFERNO, SEMIRAMIS, CERVELLO, MUSEO 
ROSENBACH, etc.). <p>I highly recommend this album.
<strong>My rating: 4 1/2 stars</strong></strong></strong></em></em>

A highlight amongst the many other amazing Italian prog albums, 'Ut' is very nearly a 
perfect album. It begins with a classical piano piece ("Studio"), smoothly segueing into a 
hyper fusion piece ("XXII Strada") before landing upon the amazing "I Cavalieri Del Lago 
Dell'Ontario". Here you'll find all the hallmarks of 'Ut' within one piece: classical, jazz, hard 
rock, keyboard mayhem, heavy guitar lines, grandiosity, catchiness, lightness, darkness, 
melancholy, joyfulness. Guitarist Nico Di Palo emerges as one of the most capable progrock 
vocalists in his country, reminiscent of Il Balletto Di Bronzo's Gianni Leone and Italian cult 
figure Paul Chain. The vast array of moods and tones within "I Cavalieri..." makes this a 
quintessential piece of Italian prog, one you'd recommend to anyone wanting to hear the 
essence of the country's best in just one song. "Storia Di Una Foglia" brings things back 
down to earth. It's a soft, fragile track with a jazzrock backbone, reminding of the lightest 
moments on P.F.M.'s 'Storia Di Un Minuto'. But it's not a great piece and the album 
would've been stronger without it. Next is "Nato Adesso", which starts out like something 
from Genesis' 'Selling England By The Pound', building toward a several-minutes long guitar 
solo. This is an absolutely hypnotic section, as the guitar snakes and slithers it's way 
around the simplistic rhythm backing. Informed by key electric jazz guitarists, the solo is 
bright and eventful, loose and free-form for its duration. Next track, "C'e Troppa Guerra", 
is another highlight, and one of the heaviest tracks to come out of the Italian prog 
movement. Based on riff that drips rawness, akin to early Led Zeppelin meets early Black 
Sabbath, it branches off into several parts that give the song some lighter shading before 
crashing back into these utterly metallic riffs. Pure genius, and not one dip in excitement 
level throughout its 10 minutes. After this, things have to mellow, and they do with the 
dreamlike "Paolo E Francesca". Final track "Chi Mi Puo Capire" begins with some church 
organ, easing into melancholy drama and some beautiful vocal peaks. A great way to end 
this eventful listen. Clearly an album of multiple mood changes, all communicated 
effectively with expert playing and some expressive vocal work.
<p>
If you're already well acquainted with early P.F.M., Banco and Il Balletto Di Bronzo, but 
haven't yet made friends with New Trolls, this is the album with which to make your 
introduction.</strong></strong></em></em>

This is definitively a good album (the last released before first New Trolls' split up),  
where the members of the band show their great musicianship wandering between 
progressive moods and hard rock.... After an album in English language ("Searching 
For A Land"), the band come back to Italian lyrics: the title of the album "Ut" is the 
first note of the Gregorian musical scale created by Guido d'Arezzo and the Italian poet Dante Alighieri is quoted on the album's jacket.   <p>The instrumental opener "Studio" is a Johann Baptist Cramer's studio for piano 
elaborated by Maurizio Salvi and it  leads to another short instrumental "XXII^ 
strada", more jazzy and "proggy": both seem to be efforts to blend classical and 
rock influences with good results.<p>Then comes "I cavalieri del lago dell'Ontario" (The Ontario Lake's Riders), my 
favourite track on this album, where drums and flute introduce a kind of military 
march while the vocals draw an epic and doomed Canadian landscape (don't forget 
that the bass player in this line up, Franck Laugelli, is from Toronto!). "The path is 
long and hard / I'm tired and I can't keep up / I lost my companions / When I'm 
back I will cry / The forest was hugging me / I couldn't think to return anymore / 
Red jackets blended to the blood / That Ontario River will bring away"... Then the 
music brings "echoes of war" before to come up to an end. "Everything ended so / 
Nobody never came back / And into the time will run / The march that accompanied 
us".<p>The short folkish "Storia di una foglia" is the only weak moment in this album while 
the following "Nato adesso", a piano ballad that melts in a long acid guitar solo, is 
another great track. "C'è troppa Guerra" is a long "hard rock" song with a 
remarkable "aggressive" electric guitar work, but in my opinion Nico Di Palo's voice 
seems here too fragile to match up with the music. "Paolo e Francesca" and the 
amazing "Chi mi può capire"(Who can understand me) are more delicate and fit 
better to "New Trolls style". "Nobody can understand. I will leave silently / 
Without a goal / And you will come with me"<p>In the whole this is a great album and it marks the end of New Trolls' 
progressive "Halcyon days".

The band would break up after this record. The same old story where two talented leaders 
of a band are trying to have their own way until they tire of fighting all the time and a 
breakup occurs.You can really hear this in this record as it is quite uneven. From mellow 
and classical sounding to heavy, guitar oriented music. It is hard to tell it's the same band 
at times.<p>
The album opens with 2 instrumentals. First up is "Studio" a classical, piano led song that opens 
and closes with the sound of a gong. "XXII Strada" features piano, drums, guitar and organ 
in this less than 2 minute song. "I Cavalieri Del Lago Dell'Ontario" opens and closes with 
marching drums but it's what is in between that is impressive. Great vocals. "Storia Di Una 
Foglia" is a really good song, one of my favourites on the album. The acoustic guitar and 
drums with the cool electric guitar melodies overtop. And again the beautiful Italian 
vocals. "Nato Adesso" opens with piano and vocals before the organ comes in and then 2 
minutes in things get intense. Great sound ! Then one of the best parts of the record when 
the guitarist just plays and plays this beautiful, energetic solo for an insane amount of 
time. Amazing !<p>"C'e Troppa Guerra" is where things seem a little out of place.This song 
sounds just like a BLACK SABBATH tune I kid you not ! I love it, as the vocals sound 
processed in the beginning but then sound incredible as the band really rocks out. It gets 
pastoral 5 minutes in before it gets blown to hell 6 minutes in. A minute later we are treated 
to a crushing guitar solo. "Paolo E Francesca" opens with mournful guitar as reserved vocals 
join in. This song reminds of TRETTIOARIGA KRIGET and the guitarist can almost make his guitar 
talk. "Chi Mi Puo Capire" has a brief organ intro before this mellow song plays out.<p>
For me this record has too many songs that are not memorable while the good ones are 
amazing indeed. 3.5 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

Fifth album from this veteran group that will be lasting unusually long and will produce 
shorter-lived offshoots. The New Trolls appeared in 67 as a psychedelic group releasing 
hard blues-rock singles (and later compiled into their second eponymous album), before 
releasing the first concept album of the peninsula (even if it is a bit confused and not 
really prog). From 71 onwards, NT will hit their stride with Concerto Grosso, Searching 
For A land and this album, usually considered their best, Ut; NT's rock is now full-blown 
progressive rock with lots of classical influences. Not really lucky with its incredibly bland 
outer artwork, slightly better with the innerfold, the group develops a surprisingly 
tough-sounding hard-progging symphonic music and there is again little doubt who's the 
leader of the group: singing lead guitarist Nico Di Palo, but he is well seconded by 
keyboardist Maurizio Salvi, which comes in handy since second guitarist Vittorio De 
Scalzi is quite discreet on this album - he would leave soon after this album's release. In 
some ways this is even more metallic than the huge sound of the De De Lind album<p>Opening on a gong-bang, the album is strongly heading into a deeply rich classical piano 
piece, which will be followed by another bong of the gang (you knew this was coming, 
didn't you ;-) and the piano leading into a short head-twisting instrumental (22nd 
Century) full-speed ahead, all sails deployed scorcher. Horseman Of Lake Ontario is 
quite a different ride starting smoothly, after a marching drum (and ending in one too) 
but soon the two guitars are adopting Led Sabbath stances (hinting at the flipside's 
epic), but the end of the track is dominated by constant key changes. The following 
Foglia is starting out on acoustic guitar and delicate vocals, maintaining throughout the 
song, and even though Di Palo pulls in some lovely electric leads, this could be the 
album's weakest point. Nato Adesso is more of a Focus-type of number with Di Palo 
sounding like Jan Akkerman in a lengthy jazzy solo while Salvi pulls in the Strings ARP 
synth lines behind it. Excellent.<p>The flipside starts out on the monstrous Troppa Guerra, with its Iommi-esque guitar 
riffs and often trading space with more pastoral moments; the many different parts 
mesh well into each other and can make the unaware a bit dizzy. This is one of Italy's 
prog more surprising song and the second highlight of the album. The next two tracks 
are a little too close to Santana's later syrupy ballads (including at times Di Palo 
sounding like Carlos) for my liking, even if in P&F the long guitar solo butters it up a bit 
too thickly on a thin slice of bread. The closing Capire (who'll understand me?) is filled 
with ARP strings layers and delves a bit too much aerial not to be taken as second-rate 
Santana<p>This album will be their last one before their temporary split in 73, leading to legal name 
problems and into different offshoots (Tritons, Ibis and NT Atomic System and other 
projects), before getting back together in 76, but they will fail to recapture their former 
brilliance. While this album has some particularly superb moments, the album has also its 
weaker points, even if the Santana-esque ending can be easily over-looked. Very much 
worth the discovery.

My tortuous week of having to review New Trolls albums continues, as I mentioned these guys are not my favorite.  However, UT
is definitely easier for me to swallow than the previous two albums.  Here I can hear a group asserting an identity beyond
wishing themselves the Hendrix/Purple/Tull Appreciation Society.  I hear Italian vocals, more thoughtful compositions, more
nuanced playing, and less showing off.  But while it is a slight improvement over the previous two it still falls short of
something I can recommend.  There are some nice moments here and there but again you have a rather forgettable set of songs
which don't relate well to each other.  Some of the shorter tracks are pointless filler.  Many of the longer ones have their
moments but fall short of real Italian prog grandeur to this listener.  Frankly you can hear the lack of focus caused by the
friction in the group with some tracks not complimenting others as mentioned, and other songs drifting on and off of
auto-pilot.  The notable exception is "C'e Troppa Guerra" which may be the heaviest song to come out of 1973, right up there
with Sabbath chugness.  This track has some big nasty riffs and Ozzyish vocals that will go for your jugular.  Well assembled
and well played, it rocks but still bores me, I'd rather play Sabbath if I need this kind of fix.  "Paolo e Francesca" is so
laid back it sounds a bit like a drunken practice session.  I'm a bit tough on the Trolls I realize but I have to call em as
I see em. I see their early albums as slightly progged-up hard rock of average quality, that's as simple as I can put it. 
I'll go up to 2½ stars for the improved "UT" over the previous but still can't get to 3.  Most reviewers like them better
than I so decide for yourself!

<strong>Good album this UT is...then why can't I love this so much?</strong><p>This as-everyone-says symphonic album is surely one of the most beautiful and popular albums of all New 
Trolls' ones. Needless to say, the stream of tracks from first (<strong>Studio</strong>) to second (<strong>Xxii 
Strada</strong>) is too dynamic and heavy to express, and the last song <strong>Chi Mi Puo' Capire</strong> is, I 
wanna say, the most sentimental song of all Italian progressive rock songs. I've listened to it again and 
again and yet can't help weepin'. Not kidding!<p>I wonder why I can't love this work so enough. This NT band would split up into two pieces after releasing 
the album. I suggest this band on just the time might have fragileness. But, regretfully, they couldn't have 
tension and potential before the split as Close-to-the-edge Yes. Conversely they might not have enough 
potential then...if they had more tension and motivation, this product would be the most progressive one 
all over the world...pardon me, in my opinion. Because I like this album.<p>This very appreciated work...with my above-mentioned reason, I can give ONLY 4 stars.</strong></strong></em></em>

After having released such a disparate double album (half studio, half live) with a serious 
heavy sound, the band offers quite a symphonic piece of Italian music. The type that I like?<p>Wonderful keyboards (mainly piano) during the opener, the influence will be more jazzy 
for "XXII Starda". But this was a general influence within most of the prog giants from the 
early seventies in Italy. One more thing to add: the deep influence of ELP on this track.<p>Nothing really surprising that "Cavalieri Del Lago Dell'Ontario" opens on some martial 
rhythm (which are precursory of "The Battle Of Epping Forest" from whom you might know. 
Vocal are also very pleasant and the sustained beat is quite remarkable. So, the paternity 
of the great intro of this well known song is either the conception of "The New Trolls" or 
from "Ange" is their great song "La Dignité" featured on their debut also release din 1972.<p>The mood is very much linked to the ISP I love so much. But even during such a delicate 
and moving track as "Nato Adesso", the band will add some nice heavy and jazzy depths. 
Again, there is little abnormal here?(well maybe the heavy part). The guitar play sounds 
quite like some "Santana" ones as well. But, can they be blamed for this???<p>The heavy infrastructure developed during "C' È Troppa Guerra" combined with psychedelic 
parts is probably showing the different musical approach of the members which will lead to 
their split into two different entities. It is amazing to hear these two influences in one track. 
And a very one indeed. Almost Hendrix at times!<p>Needless to say that the wonderful soft ballad "Paolo e Francesca" is quite a pleasant 
tune: melodic as Italian prog can be (believe me), it offers a fine moment of relaxation. The 
guitar work sounds again like the great Carlos one. Did I say that I like it?<p>The closing and passionate "Chi Mi Può Capire" is definitely throwing this album into the 
four stars category. A sweet piece indeed which shows the dilemma of the band.
Their best piece of work so far.

Especially, the activity of this New Trolls might be also important in the flow on which 
various musicians were acting as a band that supports the dawn of Prog Rock of Italy. 
Generally, the evaluations might be able to be found gathering in the album that they 
announced to the work in the 70's a lot. <p>Especially, the work known well among the fan and listeners might be an album that spent 
between 1971 and 1972 and was announced. The method of the music character 
concerning albums of men who announced at this time and the expression will give the 
impression that evolved very much with passage. The activity of Prog Rock of Italy at that 
time had details from which carrying everything before one the market and one main 
current were completed regardless of the comparison of each album. Consideration 
concerning the content of an individual album is different according to the purpose \ reality. 
However, details of a content of the album at this time that New Trolls announced and rapid 
evolution might be the points that should make a special mention. <p>"Concerto Grosso" that they announced in 1971 is originally produced because of the 
music of the movie. Classic part with consistency carried out with Part1 and Part 2 and part 
where a certain kind of baroque was accompanied. The part of a bold orchestration might 
have multiplied the spur by their music characters at this time. <p>The music character of "Concerto Grosso" gave indeed complete construction because 
there was details as the music for the movie shown by the above-mentioned description. 
Attention is attracted as a still .."Concerto Grosso".. masterpiece the item of Prog Rock of 
Italy. However, because the work of Luis Enriquez Bacalov was important as the concept for 
the album, "Concerto Grosso" might have had the impression that respect of competing by 
Bacalov is shown with the band. The element of the pastoral music character and the 
culture was one of the features of Euro Rock at this time for the dawn of Prog Rock of Italy. 
Each band used an original technique and it is likely to have gone in the part where a good 
music character of Italy of P.F.M and I Pooh in respect technical as represented was 
emphasized. <p>Following of part classic as flow derived from intense part and "Concerto Grosso" 
to "Searching For A Land" announced in 1972 continuing. In this flow, the band might be 
evidence that the desire concerning the creation appears enough very much. And, to agree 
with this flow, they do not neglect the pursuit of the music character. Flow that Frank 
Langelli joined Bass player. Or, the band that received Maurizio Salvi in the keyboard player 
might have acted on their music characters well. They replace the member as a result with 
the revolution of the music character further by centering on Vittorio De Scalzi that plays 
leader's role. However, the construction of the melody to always express after they debuted 
and the height of the perfection of the tune might have had the expression besides other 
bands with evolution. And, it will be able to be thought that this flow is surely connected with 
this "UT". Their expressions were complete as the flow that reached this "UT" at last as a 
work of their initial representative. <p>After it is formed to 1966, New Trolls is always offering the music of fine quality as well as 
other bands. It shifts to four person organization in 2nd album though the band was five 
person organization at the time of the debut. The activity of the band after this "UT" is 
announced leaps further with member's replacement. And, the member who is on the 
register in the band develops into "Nico,Gianni,Frank,Maurizio". The part where the history 
of Euro Rock indeed at that time is symbolized can be found if it thinks about the flow that 
shifts here to "Ibis". <p>It is one of the bands that this New Trolls is very important as the band that supports the 
market Prog Rock of Italy from the period first. It is likely to be always held in high esteem of 
course as a leading group in Italy as well as Banco, Osanna, and Le Orme. This time might 
be in the point that the song and the melody are completely constructed as a good point 
that characterized and Prog Rock of Italy had. Technical respect might be necessary of 
course partially of the expression. However, an important point will hit the pastoral song 
and melody for the expression that various bands , for example, this time have had. There 
was originality from which New Trolls was always carried out. However, the album to 
announce in the 70's will have to be paid to attention especially if the music character 
refined in the age is considered. <p>"Studio" is a part of the organ that produces the sound of the solemnity with the impact by 
China Gong. And, the flow of the melody of complete classic is perfect. Classic melody that 
piano and organ do. The tune develops here further. <p>"XXII Strada" is a tune mainly composed of six rhythms. The role of interlude might be 
played in the album. Piano sound in which completely aggressive melody is constructed. 
The performance of the band established by making good use of fast Passage is 
overwhelming. And, the listener is stimulated attended with a melody that is more 
aggressive the melody of the guitar. The band makes a complete dash feeling in union with 
the organ. The rhythm might also have the part that looks like the jazz waltz. <p>As for "I Cavalieri Del Lago Dell'Ontario", the keyboard and the guitar progress to the march 
drum coming in succession. Melody of song that produces transparent feeling. The part of 
the melody that becomes intense and the composition by the chorus might be splendid. 
There is exactly a flavor of the music character that they have. The line and the guitar of 
Bass that supports solo of the keyboard also contribute to the tune well. <p>"Storia Di Una Foglia" is a tune with the flavor of Folk Rock. The melody extremely gives the 
listener the relief. The part where an acoustic part was emphasized is pastoral. And, the 
obbligati flows with the guitar. There might be a good flow including the melody of the song. <p>"Nato Adesso" is a powerful ballade with complete expression of feelings. Part of song to 
get on beautiful piano melody. Progress of peculiar melody and Chord of Prog Rock of Italy. 
The introduction of the synthesizer is also splendid. When the rhythm joins, the tune heads 
for the top further. Especially, guitar Solo of about five minutes and ensemble of the band 
will invite the listener to the crucible of the excitement. The composition of the tune is 
perfect. <p>"C'e Troppa Guerra" might be a tune to emphasize the part of Rock in this album. 
Construction of Riff of guitar that has both intense part and peculiar part. Or, the 
composition used properly for the part of the voice with the anacatesthesia has originality. 
The tune becomes intenser and progresses. Making the sound in which psychedelic is 
recollected also has expanded the width of the tune. <p>In "Paolo E Francesca", the melody of a dry guitar is a feature. The ballade that contains 
love makes a good, transparent feeling. The band performed well has a good flavor. 
Especially, the part that duplicates the conversation by the guitar and flits in the speaker 
might be a good idea. The sound of the percussion instrument also contributes well for the 
tune. <p>"Chi Mi Puo Capire" is a grand tune to express the part of "Quietness" of the band 
and "Movement". Flow that power of expression of singing is slowly emphasized. Flow of 
melody of magnificent keyboard that gently wraps the song. A beautiful melody is good in 
the progress of Chord each other. The melody of good piano Solo and the song is 
extremely grand. The part of following the power of expression of the band and the music 
character might be exactly blocked in this tune and it appear. The composition of this album 
is calculated the overall and well. <p>It is an album that offered very high-quality music in the work group of New Trolls in the 
70's. <p><p>

The first time I heard this album I honestly thought that "Ut" was quite a sorry excuse for an album. It 
seemed to disparate and fragmented to be enjoyable. But after a while I changed my mind, realising 
that what I at first glance percieved as messy in fact was the opposite. I found the golden thread and 
now I love this album. "Ut" is, I think, a heavy, hard rocking album with a few nods to Sabbath 
(Particularily true in the case of "C'e troppa guerra") as well as being clearly progressive. The music 
merges together to create the illusion of one, long work of art. The two songs "Nato Adesso" 
and "Paolo E Francesca" are my favourites, though the album works fantastically well as a whole. It's 
more about the album as a whole than it's parts. A truly enjoyable and amazing album.</strong></strong></em></em>

This is the final New Trolls album before their discography disintegrates into a confusing morass of competing factions 
and reunions. On the one hand, it's nice that before conflict broke out within the band that they were able to put 
together a really strong album for 1972 - the year that the Italian prog boom which they had played such an important 
part in laying the groundwork for really exploded. (They also put out Searching For a Land in the same year, but that 
was hampered by awkward English lyrics and even more awkward band conflicts.) On the other hand, it illustrates why 
whilst New Trolls might have been pioneers of Italian prog, they'd never quite be the top-tier masters that groups like 
Banco, PFM, or Le Orme would become in their prime.<p>The album sees them shift to a hard rock mode for much of it, with some of it approaching Black Sabbath levels of 
intensity before elements of soft rock start creeping in for the two closing numbers. If that sounds bizarre, well, it is: 
UT is the sound of New Trolls having a serious personality crisis right in front of the listener. Moreover, because the 
band goes to a more hard rock approach than previously, they're effectively evolving backwards to earlier musical 
styles just as other Italian prog bands are adapting the cutting edge of progressive rock to their own particular styles, 
with the result that whilst this album would have been revelatory coming out in 1970, compared to the other Italian 
prog great releases of 1972 it seems a little behind the times.<p>With the passage of time, of course, this is less of an issue, and there's a lot to like about the album - it's probably my 
favourite Trolls release. But with the band flailing for a distinctive identity or personality which they just couldn't settle 
on, I fear it also represents the peak of their accomplishment, not a foundation for future success.</strong></strong></em></em>

Although the plethora of opinions say that Concerto Grosso per is the album that defines the band, I'd easily point to Ut as my go to favorite New Trolls album.<p>
 With riffs off a Sabbath album splattered across much of the proceedings, you can sense the band is starting to fracture into two distinct factions right in front of your eyes: a heavy rock angle (they are really good at this), and a more introspective classical angle (the Concerto Grosso approach). The ten minute guitar meltdown of C'e Troppa Guerra would not be out of place on the first Wolfmother album (a little known hard rock classic), but at its core oozes complex Black Sabbath. (Electric Wizard fans take note). <p>
That is probably as far as some prog fans will read, but this album is way more complex than a simple 70's metal romp. Acoustic pop friendly songs, frightening orchestrations, classical keyboard exercises, guitars having a conversation (literally talking) in Paulo e Francesca, sprightly Italian folk melodies, slow melancholic symphonic ballads-the differences between keyboardist Maurizio Salvi and guitarist Vittorio De Scalzi could not be more prominently displayed. Somehow it works. <p>
Reference points: Not easy. They are kind of their own self contained beast. Some ELP and Black Sabbath collide, but not necessarily in the same song. Side one is near perfection in Italian rock that appeals to all, not just RPI fans (Nato Adesso being a great example of the synthesis of the two styles) , and side two is the aforementioned guitar meltdown centerpiece. <p>
This was their swan song until the semi successful reunion later on Concerto Grosso 2. NT Atomic System and ? (yes, ?) who turned into Ibis are on the horizon after the split. <p>
For fans leaning towards the heavier side of RPI. But if you are an Italian prog fan and don't have this album, seek it immediately.

In my childhood I used to think of New Trolls as the "Italian BeeGees", cheerfully invading 
the airplay with their "saccarine" based "Quella carezza della sera". It was a shock for me

Album released in 1972 "UT". The content exists together to hard rock a symphonic 
work, and lacks the settlement a little in total. However, the performance is advanced. 
Especially, the keyboard and the guitar are splendid.

This is a good work by New Trolls. The riffs and the music generally is not the best you can 
expect from a progressive band, but this is also an original and energic album. The songs 
are full of hard rock riffs and in the case of "I Cavalieri del Lago Ontario", with classical part
