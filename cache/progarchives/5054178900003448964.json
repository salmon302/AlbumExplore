It's a simple bass note written on a Fender Rhodes piano that started everything. Thomas played a big role in the songwriting and the production and with his playing skills. The album \"A Drop of Light\" also received the help of 5 musicians playing sax, flute, and trumpet. The release of the album is the result of 5 years of work. You can hear apart from the obvious influence of ANGLAGARD some Canterbury prog and some Jazz tones.\n\nrdtprog\n\n\u2b50 Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2018 \u2b50",
