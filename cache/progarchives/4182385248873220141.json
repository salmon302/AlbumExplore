  "biography": "Colosseum biography\n\nFounded in 1968 - Disbanded in 1971 - Reunited  from 1994 up to 2015\n\nThis is one of the pivotal progressive bands that emerged in the second part of the Sixties. Unfortunalety the progressive world was more impressed by The NICE and KING CRIMSON, so in my opinion COLOSSEUM is a bit understimated progrock band. In '68 the founding members were drummer Jon Hiseman, tenor sax-player\n\nDick HECKSTALL-SMITH\n\nand bass player Tony Reeves, later joined by\n\nDave GREENSLADE\n\n(keyboards), Dave Clempson (guitar), Chris Farlowe (vocals) and Mark Clark, he replaced Tony Reeves. COLOSSEUM made three studio albums: \"Those Who Are To Die We Salute You\" and \"Valentyne Suite\" (both from '69) and \"Daughter Of Time\" ('70). The music is a progressive mix of several styles (rock, jazz, blues) with lots of sensational solos and captivating interplay. In '71 the band released their highly acclaimed live album \"Colosseum live\", a proove of their great skills on stage but also showing that at some moments the compositions sounded a bit too stretched.\n\nAfter COLOSSEUM was disbanded in '71, most of these members formed or joined known groups like HUMBLE PIE (Clem Clempson),\n\nATOMIC ROOSTER\n\n(Chris Farlowe),\n\nGREENSLADE\n\n(Dave Greenslade re-united with Tony Reeves) and\n\nCOLOSSEUM II\n\n(founded by Jon Hiseman). In '91 the label Castle Communications released the comprehensive compilation CD entitled \"The Time Machine\".\n\nThe second album \"The Valentyne Suite\" is considired as their best. It sounds mature and varied with the epic titletrack as the highlight: it's build up around a mindblowing solo on the Hammond organ by Dave Greenslade and great guitarwork by James Litherland. And if you like brass (I don't!), Dick Heckstall-Smith delivers stunning tenor-saxophone work.\n\n: : :\n\nErik Neuteboom, The NETHERLANDS\n\n: : :\n\nFan & official Prog Archives collaborator",
