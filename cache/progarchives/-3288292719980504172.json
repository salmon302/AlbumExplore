  "biography": "Gentle Giant biography\n\nFormed in 1970 in London, UK- Disbanded in 1980\n\nGENTLE GIANT is known as the paradigmatic progressive rock band. With an uncomparable musicianship, they went as far as no one ever did into unexplored grounds in the progressive music, navigating over dissonant 20th-century classical chamber music, medieval vocal music, jazz and rock. The multi-instrumentation capabilities of the musicians gave such dynamic to their music, which set parameters to a whole coming generation up to these very days. They explored Moogs, Mellotrons and Fender Rhodes usage with such majesty! Not to mention other instruments like oboes, violins, cellos and horns among others.\n\nThe band was able to come across the 70's maintaining an outstanding level on their music, altering their style over the years and keeping the quality as only a few bands were able to do. Among their magnificent discography, all the albums from \"Acquiring the Taste\" through \"Playing the Fool\" are essential progressive rock releases (with the possible exception of \"Interview\"). This portion of the band's career would see a fittingly grand conclusion on the live \"Playing the Fool\" album. What more is there to say about these masters of progressive music?\n\nSee also:\n\nThree Friends",
