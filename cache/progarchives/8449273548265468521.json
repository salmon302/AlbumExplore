  "name": "PORCUPINE TREE",
  "genre": "Heavy Prog",
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "biography": "Formed in 1987 in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire - Suspended activity since 2010\n\nPORCUPINE TREE are incredibly hard to describe because their music doesn't fit into any one genre. I like the description on the back of the album \"Signify\" (one of my all time favorites). It says \"Porcupine Tree have managed to defy genres and blend together numerous ambient, rock and avant-garde styles to create a musical landscape that is both refreshing and compulsively seductive\". The great post-GONG revival which gave birth to OZRIC TENTACLES now brings us PORCUPINE TREE. The hypnotic rhythms, spacy synthesizers, glissando guitar and crazy voices which made the style successful are all contained here.\n\n\u2b50 Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2005 \u2b50\n\n\u2b50 Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2007 \u2b50\n\nThe band started as a solo project of singer-songwriter-guitarist\n\nSTEVEN WILSON\n\nwho, back in the early nineties, released a series of increasingly spaced-out ambient excursions. PT is one of the most innovative bands in prog today combining intense musicianship, unconventional composition and superb studio production. They are unquestionably one of the UK's most inspired and inventive rock groups.\n\nThe bands 4th studio album from '96. \"Signify\" saw Porcupine Tree truly gell as a studio band producing a blend of psychedelia, heavy rock, melancholic pop, kraut rock, and wild experimentation that brought the best out of each band member. Their latest two albums (\"Stupid Dream\" and \"Lightbulb Sun\") move the band further away from their influences and into their own catagory, by which other bands eventually will be compared. But if you are a fan of progressive, thoughtful, briliantly executed and flawlessly produced music, you will do no better than PT.\n\nPORCUPINE TREE's eighth studio album, \"Deadwing\", was released in March 2005 by Lava Records / Warner Music. Less rock-oriented than the previous album \"In Absentia\", \"Deadwing\" is partially based on a \"surreal ghost story\" screenplay written by Steven and sometime PORCUPINE TREE / NO-MAN art collaborator Mike Bennion. The 60-minute, nine-track album contains material varying from short airplay-friendly songs such as 'Shallow' to lengthier pieces like the 10-minute-plus 'Arriving Somewhere But Not Here'. Most of the music was written by Steven but the album features the largest amount of full-band compositions since \"Signify\" in 1997. The album also features guest appearances by Adrian Belew (KING CRIMSON) and Mikael \ufffdkerfeldt (OPETH).\n\nIn 2007 the band scored its biggest chart success to date with \"Fear Of A Blank Planet\". Featuring contributions from Alex Lifeson and Robert Fripp it made the album charts in both the UK and USA and saw them play to larger and larger crowds on the subsequent world tour. This uplift in fortunes was due in part to the band signing to Roadrunner Records who really got behind the band. In 2009 the band released \"The Incident\" their most ambitious work to date and also their most successful, charting highly in the UK, USA and across Europe.\n\nSee also:\n\n-\n\nBlackfield\n\n-\n\nI.E.M.\n\n-\n\nNo-Man",
