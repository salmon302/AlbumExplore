  "country": "Multi-National",
  "biography": "Formed in Paris, France in 1968 - Disbanded in 1976 - Reformed intermittently since 1990\n\nGONG is a Space/Canterbury Rock group formed by Australian guitarist (formerly of\n\nSOFT MACHINE\n\n)\n\nDaevid ALLEN\n\n. He did not do it alone though, he & his wife, Gilli Smyth are the whole nucleus of that band with numerous band line-ups. \"Magick Brother, Mystic Sister\" is GONG's first release & the line up consists of:\n\nDidier MALHERBE\n\n(sax), Christian Tritsch (guitar),\n\nPip PYLE\n\n(drums) & of course, Daevid Allen (guitar & lead vocals) while his wife Gilli performed the spacey vocals. GONG's second release: \"Camembert Electrique\" is the beginning of Allan's ideas of Pot Head pixies, Radio Gnome's, & Octave Doctor's featured on later albums of \"The Radio Gnome Invisible Trilogy\" along with the Protagonist Zero The Hero, which consisted of \"Flying Teapot\" (1972), \"Angel's Egg\" (1973) & \"You\" (1974). After \"Camembert Electrique\" release also saw a new line-up & a steady one. The line-up consisted of: Didier Malherbe (sax) Mike Howlett (bass), Pierre Moerlen (drums),\n\nSteve HILLAGE\n\n(guitar), Tim Blake (synthesizers) & of course, Daevid (vocals & guitar) & Gilli (space vocals). This line-up would last until \"You\". When Allen, Smyth, & Blake departed due to dissatisfaction of being an instrumental band this led Pierre to be the leader & released \"Shamal\" in 1976. Hillage lost faith in the group & departed as well.\n\nAll of the \"Radio Gnome Trilogy\" albums & \"Camembert Electrique\" are great places to start for anyone interesting in GONG. \"Magick Brother, Mystic Sister\" is very raw, & not as technical or jam worthy as later GONG, but the Canterbury humor is still there. \"Shamal\" is the beginning of their Fusion sound that would be later presented on later albums. \"Gong Live\" features a good compilation of tracks performed live would also be good starter album.\n\n: : : Alexander Vogel : : :\n\nDiscography:\n\nWith original year of issue and format.\n\nBasic, incomplete, GONG-named band discography.\n\nA more advanced, far-reaching, super-hyperlinked and inaccurate version will be made eventually....\n\nStudio albums, live albums and singles:\n\n1969 - Magick Brother-Gong BYG LP\n\n1970 - Est-ce-que je suis-Gong BYG 7\"\n\n1971 - Camembert Electrique-Gong BYG LP\n\n1971 - Continental Circus-Gong Phillips LP\n\n1972 - Glastonbury Fayre Revelation 3LP-1 side live Gong\n\n1972 - Live at Dingwalls-Greasy Truckers Vol 2 Island 2LP-1 side live Gong\n\n1973 - The Radio Gnome Invisible, Pt 1: Flying Teapot-Gong Virgin LP\n\n1974 - Angel's Egg-Gong Virgin LP\n\n1974 - You-Gong Virgin LP\n\n1976 - Shamal-Gong Virgin LP\n\n1977 - Gazeuse!-Gong Virgin LP\n\n1977 - Gong Est Morte, Vive Gong-Gong Celluloid LP\n\n1977 - Live Etc.-Gong Virgin 2LP\n\n1978 - Expresso II-Gong Virgin LP\n\n1990 - Live in Paris 73-Gong Mantra 2LP\n\n1990 - Live At Sheffield 1974-Gong Mantra LP\n\n1992 - Shapeshifter-Gong Celluloid CD\n\n1993 - Live On TV 1990-Gong Code 90 CD\n\n1995 - Camembert Eclectique-Gong GAS CD\n\n1995 - 25th Birthday Party-Gong Voiceprint/GAS 2CD\n\n1995 - Pre-Modernist Wireless: The Peel Sessions-Gong Strange Fruit CD\n\n1997 - You Remixed-Gong Gliss 2CD\n\n1997 - A Sprinkling of Clouds-Gong Gliss 12\"\n\n1998 - Family Jewels-Gong GAS 2CD\n\n2000 - Zero To Infinity-Gong One-Eyed Salmon CD\n\n2000 - Live 2 Infinitea-Gong Snapper Music CD\n\n2002 - Classic Rock Legends-Gong Classic Rock Legends DVD\n\n2002 - High Above The Subterrania 2000-Gong Snapper Music DVD\n\n2002 - OK Friends-Gong GAS CD\n\n2002 - Glastonbury 1971-Gong GAS CD\n\nCompilations:\n\n1986 - A Wingful Of Eyes-Gong Virgin CD\n\n1996 - The Best Of Gong Nectar Masters CD\n\n1997 - The Very Best Of Gong Summit CD\n\n1998 - The Best Of Gong Reactive CD\n\n1999 - Other Side of the Sky-Gong Snapper Music 2CD\n\n2002 - From Here To Eternitea-Gong Snapper Music 2CD\n\nSee also:\n\n-\n\nDashiell HEDAYATT \"Obsolete\"\n\n-\n\nMOTHER GONG",
