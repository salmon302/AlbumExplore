  "name": "FOCUS",
  "genre": "Symphonic Prog",
  "country": "Netherlands",
  "biography": "Focus biography\n\nFounded in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1969 - disbanded in 1978 - reunited 1985, 1990, 1999 - reformed in 2002\n\nOf all the groups in the 1970s that combined elements of rock and classical music, FOCUS is, without a doubt, the most notable Dutch group widely known outside the Netherlands. This band has created excitement all over the world during the past few years with their unique sound and musical approach. The two main musicians in the band were flutist/keyboardist/singer Thijs Van LEER and guitarist\n\nJan AKKERMAN\n\n. They played a stylishly inventive rock with flutes, keyboards & dazzling guitar, defining the Dutch prog sound. An inspiration to FINCH, TRACE & numerous others. In 1978, the group finally split up, without making too much noise.\n\nBest albums are \"Moving Waves\" (1972), \"3\" (1973), \"Live at the Rainbow\" (1973), and \"Hamburger Concerto\" (1974). \"Waves\" and \"3\" represent the best of the band's earlier intensely progressive period with plenty of sidelong tracks and healthly extended solos. Most will agree that \"Live at the Rainbow\" and \"Hamburger Concerto\" (last good album) were their best, moving into a period of more pure classical and jazz influence.\n\n\"Focus 8\" marks the return of Thijs Van LEER in the true nature of music: tuneful, memorable and a little bit rocky when they want to be. This album contains everything you might want from a FOCUS album ... plenty of flute and keyboards from Thijs, tasty guitar playing from Jan DUM\u00c9E and even some yodeling vocals. Perhaps in summary, the band could have veered a little from the safety of the FOCUS blueprint but \"Focus 9\" may yet further develop their own voice. No doubt about it, we'll have to count on FOCUS in the new millennium to all of the true Progressive Rock lovers.",
