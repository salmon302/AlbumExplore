# Tag Normalizer Upgrade - Summary

## What Was Done

I've analyzed your tag export files (`raw_tags_export.csv` and `atomic_tags_export.csv`) and created a comprehensive plan to upgrade and improve the tag normalization system.

## Deliverables

### 1. **Analysis Document** (`TAG_NORMALIZER_ANALYSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`)
A detailed 300+ line document containing:
- Comprehensive analysis of tag data issues
- 8 major problem categories identified
- Specific examples with counts from your actual data
- Prioritized recommendations
- Implementation plan with 4 phases
- Expected impact metrics
- Test cases
- Migration strategy

### 2. **Enhanced Normalizer Implementation** (`src/albumexplore/tags/normalizer/enhanced_normalizer.py`)
A production-ready enhanced tag normalizer with:
- **400+ lines of code**
- Extends your existing `TagNormalizer` class
- Enhanced misspelling dictionary (20+ new entries)
- Hyphen vs space standardization rules
- Suffix pattern normalization (-core, -gaze, -wave)
- Multi-tag splitting (handles "/"-separated tags)
- Context-aware compound genre handling
- Comprehensive test demonstrations

### 3. **Analysis Script** (`analyze_tag_exports.py`)
A utility script that:
- Reads your tag export CSV files
- Analyzes case variants, hyphen/space variants, misspellings
- Calculates normalization impact
- Generates a detailed Markdown report
- Shows before/after statistics

## Key Findings from Analysis

### Major Issues Identified:

1. **Case Inconsistency** (50+ groups)
   - Example: "Alt Metal" / "Alt metal" / "Alt-metal" all separate

2. **Hyphen/Space Variants** (100+ groups)
   - Example: "Post-Metal" (23) vs "Post Metal" (2) vs "Post metal" (1)

3. **Misspellings** (20+ found)
   - "Atmosheric" → "Atmospheric"
   - "Ghotic" → "Gothic"
   - "Pschedelic" → "Psychedelic"

4. **Multi-tag Entries**
   - "Death Metal/Heavy Metal/OSDM" needs splitting

5. **Compound Genre Inconsistency**
   - "Melodic Death Metal" vs "Melodic Death metal" vs "melodic death metal"

### Expected Impact:
- **200-300 tag reduction** through normalization
- **15-20% reduction** in total unique tags
- **95%+ consistency** in tag patterns
- Better searchability and filtering

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run the Analysis Script

```powershell
# From the project root
python analyze_tag_exports.py
```

This will:
- Analyze your current tag exports
- Generate `TAG_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` with detailed findings
- Show you exactly which tags would be normalized

### Option 2: Test the Enhanced Normalizer

```powershell
# Interactive testing
cd src
python -m albumexplore.tags.normalizer.enhanced_normalizer
```

This will run the demonstration showing:
- Example normalizations
- Statistics on improvements
- Test case results

### Option 3: Integrate into Your System

The `EnhancedTagNormalizer` can be used as a drop-in replacement:

```python
from albumexplore.tags.normalizer.enhanced_normalizer import EnhancedTagNormalizer

# Initialize
normalizer = EnhancedTagNormalizer()

# Normalize a tag
normalized = normalizer.normalize_enhanced("Alt-Metal")  # → "alt-metal"

# Split multi-tags
tags = normalizer.split_multi_tags("Death Metal/Heavy Metal/OSDM")
# → ["death metal", "heavy metal", "osdm"]

# Analyze consistency
report = normalizer.analyze_tag_consistency(your_tag_list)
```

## Next Steps - Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Review the Analysis Document**
   - Read `TAG_NORMALIZER_ANALYSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
   - Decide on normalization policies (hyphen vs space, etc.)

2. **Run the Analysis Script**
   - Execute `analyze_tag_exports.py`
   - Review the generated report
   - Identify priority fixes

3. **Test Enhanced Normalizer**
   - Run the demonstration
   - Test with sample data
   - Verify it meets your needs

### Implementation Plan:

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Add enhanced misspelling dictionary to config
- [ ] Implement case normalization
- [ ] Create test suite

#### Phase 2: Pattern Rules (Week 2)  
- [ ] Decide on hyphen/space policy
- [ ] Implement compound standardization
- [ ] Add suffix pattern rules

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement multi-tag splitting
- [ ] Add context-aware abbreviation handling
- [ ] Create compound genre intelligence

#### Phase 4: Rollout (Week 4)
- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Run normalization on test data
- [ ] Review and validate results
- [ ] Apply to production
- [ ] Update documentation

## Decision Points

You'll need to decide on:

1. **"Alt" vs "Alternative"**
   - Keep "alt-rock" or expand to "alternative rock"?
   - My recommendation: Keep "alt-" as a distinct prefix

2. **Hyphen Policy**
   - "post-metal" or "post metal"?
   - My recommendation: Use hyphens for "post-", "neo-", "avant-garde"
   - Use spaces for base genres: "death metal", "black metal"

3. **Acronyms**
   - Keep uppercase (DSBM, OSDM) or lowercase?
   - My recommendation: Keep uppercase for recognition

4. **Multi-tag Handling**
   - Split "X/Y/Z" into separate tags or keep as compound?
   - My recommendation: Split and associate with album
