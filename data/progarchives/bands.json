            "name": "pitched voice). Maybe a little ELP thrown in, particularly on \"Verso Il Sole\". Moog, string synths, piano, electric piano, and Hammond organ are the keyboards you hear. \"Una Storia Fiabesca\" does get a bit repetitive, but has grown on me. \"Il Rituale Notturno\" is a rather pleasant number complete with string synths. I like the electronic effects found at the end. \"I Due Amanti\" finds the band starting off a bit spacy, with the string synths, and electronic effects (presumably played off an EMS synth), before the music sets in. The vocals here seem to be lower-pitched and a bit off-key, making me think it was someone other than Graziano Zippo doing the vocals. I love how the music starts slowing down, simulating the sound of someone turning off their record player. Nice album to have for the Italian prog rock collector."

When he sings, the tides part and it is clear\r\nhe is meant to be the center of attention.

            "name": "pitched voice). Maybe a little ELP thrown in, particularly on \"Verso Il Sole\". Moog, string synths, piano, electric piano, and Hammond organ are the keyboards you hear. \"Una Storia Fiabesca\" does get a bit repetitive, but has grown on me. \"Il Rituale Notturno\" is a rather pleasant number complete with string synths. I like the electronic effects found at the end. \"I Due Amanti\" finds the band starting off a bit spacy, with the string synths, and electronic effects (presumably played off an EMS synth), before the music sets in. The vocals here seem to be lower-pitched and a bit off-key, making me think it was someone other than Graziano Zippo doing the vocals. I love how the music starts slowing down, simulating the sound of someone turning off their record player. Nice album to have for the Italian prog rock collector."

Some segments \r\nduring intro part - right before the vocal line - reminds me to the nuance of \"Repent \r\nWalpurgis\" by Procol Harum.

When he sings, the tides part and it is clear\r\nhe is meant to be the center of attention.  Certainly when he is to the fore I find myself noticing the proceedings a lot\r\nmore, and favourably too, whereas otherwise I tend to drift in and out.  After half a dozen listens they should seep in a\r\nlittle more, so even though nothing here is really bad, none is uniformly good either, and it seems to lack both immediate\r\nimpact and future growth prospects.   2.5 stars, rounded down.social review comments|Review PermalinkPosted Sunday, December 30, 2007|Review this album|Report(Review #157146)"

Moog, string synths, piano, electric piano, and Hammond organ are the keyboards you hear. \"Una Storia Fiabesca\" does get a bit repetitive, but has grown on me. \"Il Rituale Notturno\" is a rather pleasant number complete with string synths. I like the electronic effects found at the end. \"I Due Amanti\" finds the band starting off a bit spacy, with the string synths, and electronic effects (presumably played off an EMS synth), before the music sets in. The vocals here seem to be lower-pitched and a bit off-key, making me think it was someone other than Graziano Zippo doing the vocals.

When he sings, the tides part and it is clear\r\nhe is meant to be the center of attention.  Certainly when he is to the fore I find myself noticing the proceedings a lot\r\nmore, and favourably too, whereas otherwise I tend to drift in and out.  After half a dozen listens they should seep in a\r\nlittle more, so even though nothing here is really bad, none is uniformly good either, and it seems to lack both immediate\r\nimpact and future growth prospects.   2.5 stars, rounded down.social review comments|Review PermalinkPosted Sunday, December 30, 2007|Review this album|Report(Review #157146)"

            "name": "like strings then the song kicks in before a minute. Keyboards \r\nafter 2 1/2 minutes as the tempo picks up in this instrumental section. A calm 4 minutes in \r\nthen it builds. Vocals follow. \"I Due Amante\" is the over 13 1/2 minute closer.The \r\npercussion, drums and synths sound pretty cool to start. Organ is added. Piano 2 minutes \r\nin. Vocals 3 1/2 minutes in. Solo piano after 5 1/2 minutes followed by organ and \r\ndrums. Another killer instrumental section here that ends before 9 minutes.This is an easy one to recommend to RPI enthusiasts, it has all the ingredients and the final \r\nproduct is fantastico."

            "name": "prog here, but they shift from style to style seamlessly, \r\nso I don't think any genre would be able to keep them.  Yes, we get neo-prog, but we also \r\nget metal, alternative, and wonderful ballads.  The band utilizes an incredible drummer to \r\nkeep the music intense, but also a diverse range of guitar work, from riffing to finger work.  \r\nThe band overall has a personality and funkiness that is so attractive and absorbing.  It's \r\nquite impressive.  In fact, I'd call this music daring, and they experiment and explore freely.One of the best parts of the music is the presence of Marek Arnold and his array of keys and \r\nsax.  Seriously, anything this guys plays on is pure gold.  From his jazzy sax to his ethereal \r\nkeys atmospheres to his incredible solos and leads, Marek really carries the melody on this \r\nalbum.  The incredible interplay between proggy keys and metal is especially enjoyable for \r\nme.Like I said, though, the lyrical content is a bit of a letdown for me.  Now, this band is daring, \r\nas I said.  The concept is ambitious and well-written, and very complex, too.  It involves a \r\nman being locked in a room with six doors.  He simply needs to escape the room, and he \r\nrelies solely on his faith in God to do so.  Long story short, he realizes through his \r\nexperiences behind those doors that he needs to trust himself to escape the room, and, \r\nwhen he discovers this, he finds a seventh door (a green one, obviously) that leads him to \r\nhis lover and to true divinity (love).  I've heard all this nonsense before in a myriad of other \r\nforms, and it irks me to no end with its shallowness that masquerades as depth and truth.  \r\nReality is far more complicated than just trusting yourself for everything and leaving \r\nthousands of years of ancient wisdom behind you.  It's foolish and arrogant, to be honest.Okay, I'm done.  This is an excellent album musically, and I will listen to it often for years to \r\ncome.  However, I felt I must mention my issues with the lyrics, and I hope that it has at least \r\ninspired you to give the album and lyrics a try, too."

Additionally the cover\r\nart perfectly mirrors the inspiration behind the concept.

But they have a wonderfully creative spirit being expressed through their music--not unlike the Bender family band, INTROITUS.

Female lead singer, Anne TRAUTMANN, has a bit of the Amy DARBY feel while also quite a striking similarity to 80s pop jazz singer, BASIA.
