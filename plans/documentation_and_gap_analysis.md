# Documentation and Gap Analysis Plan

This document outlines the plan to analyze the codebase, update/create documentation, and address software gaps and needs for the AlbumExplore project.

## Overview

The goal is to improve the project's documentation, address identified implementation gaps, and identify areas for potential improvement. This plan focuses on:

1.  **Investigating and documenting the Tag System:** Understanding how tags are managed, stored, and processed.
2.  **Investigating and documenting the Visualization Implementation:** Understanding how the different views (network graph, table, arc diagram, chord diagram) are rendered.
3.  **Addressing Implementation Gaps in Roadmap Phase 8:** Focusing on incomplete items related to the network graph rework.
4.  **Addressing Implementation Gaps in Requirements (Enhanced Tag Management):** Focusing on partially implemented features related to tag management.
5.  **Updating Existing Documentation Files:** Ensuring that existing documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

```

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Investigate and Document Tag System

*   **Read `docs/tag_system.md`:** Understand the initial design and intended functionality.
*   **Search for tag-related logic:** Use `search_files` to search for keywords like "tag," "normalization," "hierarchy," "relationship," and "consolidation" across the codebase (especially in `src/albumexplore/main.py`, `src/data/utils.py`, and `src/gui/main_window.py`).
*   **Analyze database schema:** Examine the database schema to understand how tags are stored and related.
*   **Create/Update `tag_system.md`:** Document the actual implementation of the tag system, including its location, data structures, algorithms, and database interactions. Include diagrams if necessary.

### 2. Investigate and Document Visualization Implementation

*   **Analyze `src/gui/main_window.py`:** Examine the methods related to creating tabs and updating the display (e.g., `_create_network_tab`, `update_albums_table`, `update_relationships`).
*   **Search for rendering-related keywords:** Use `search_files` to search for keywords like "render," "draw," "plot," "graph," "network," "table," "arc," and "chord" across the codebase.
*   **Identify third-party libraries:** Determine if any third-party libraries (like `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `plotly`, or Qt's built-in rendering capabilities) are used for visualization.
*   **Create documentation:** Create a new documentation file (e.g., `visualization.md` in `docs/`) or update `architecture.md` to describe how the different visualization types are implemented.

### 3. Address Implementation Gaps in Roadmap Phase 8

*   **Review `docs/roadmap.md` (Phase 8):** Focus on the incomplete items: "Dynamic data loading system," "Caching mechanism implementation," "Cluster boundary visualization," "Cluster navigation controls," "Node filtering and search," "Path highlighting system," and "Custom tooltips implementation."
*   **Analyze existing code:** Examine the relevant code sections to understand the current state of implementation.
*   **Create tasks:** Create specific tasks for each incomplete item, outlining the steps required for implementation.

### 4. Address Implementation Gaps in Requirements (Enhanced Tag Management)

*   **Review `docs/requirements.md` (Enhanced Tag Management):** Focus on the "Partially Implemented" features: outlier detection, misspelling handling, alternate naming, and tag consolidation.
*   **Analyze existing code:** Examine the relevant code sections to understand the current state of implementation.
*   **Create tasks:** Create specific tasks for each incomplete feature, outlining the steps required for implementation.

### 5. Update Existing Documentation Files

*   **Read and update `architecture.md`:** Incorporate information about the tag system, visualization implementation, and overall system architecture.
*   **Read and update `data_model.md`:** Ensure it accurately reflects the database schema and data structures.
*   **Read and update `tag_system.md`:** As described in step 1.

## Timeline

*   **Investigate and Document Tag System:** 2-3 days
*   **Investigate and Document Visualization Implementation:** 2-3 days
*   **Address Implementation Gaps in Roadmap Phase 8:** 3-5 days
*   **Address Implementation Gaps in Requirements (Enhanced Tag Management):** 3-5 days
*   **Update Existing Documentation Files:** 2-3 days

**Total Estimated Time:** 12-19 days
