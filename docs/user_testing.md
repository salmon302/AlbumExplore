	- [ ] Check edge connections and weights
	- [ ] Test zoom/pan functionality
	- [ ] Verify node selection and highlighting
	- [ ] Test force-directed layout controls

- Table View:
	- [ ] Test column sorting
	- [ ] Verify filter functionality
	- [ ] Check data export features
	- [ ] Test row selection

- Arc/Chord Diagrams:
	- [ ] Verify layout and connections
	- [ ] Test interaction features
	- [ ] Check data representation accuracy

### 2.2 Tag Management
- Tag Filtering:
	- [ ] Test inclusive/exclusive/neutral states
	- [ ] Verify filter combinations
	- [ ] Check filter response time
	- [ ] Test filter reset

- Tag Organization:
	- [ ] Test hierarchical grouping
	- [ ] Verify tag clustering
	- [ ] Check auto-suggestions
	- [ ] Test tag relationships

### 2.3 Search and Navigation
- [ ] Test fuzzy search functionality
	- Partial matches
	- Similar term suggestions
	- Search response time
- [ ] Verify navigation between views
	- State preservation
	- Smooth transitions
	- Selection persistence

### 2.4 Responsive Design
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes:
	- Desktop (1920x1080)
	- Laptop (1366x768)
	- Tablet (1024x768)
- [ ] Verify layout adaptations
- [ ] Check control panel responsiveness

### 2.5 Error Handling
- [ ] Test error recovery scenarios:
	- Invalid data input
	- Network disconnection
	- Resource constraints
- [ ] Verify error messages
- [ ] Check recovery suggestions

## 3. Performance Testing Scenarios

### 3.1 Data Load Testing
- [ ] Test with 1000+ albums
- [ ] Verify rendering performance
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Monitor response times

### 3.2 Interaction Testing
- [ ] Measure zoom/pan smoothness
- [ ] Test rapid view switching
- [ ] Verify filter application speed
- [ ] Check selection responsiveness

## 4. User Experience Evaluation
