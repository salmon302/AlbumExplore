# Album Explorer - Technical Requirements Specification

## 1. System Overview
The Album Explorer is an interactive visualization system for exploring music albums through their tag relationships, providing an intuitive interface for discovering music through interconnected characteristics.

## 2. Data Management

### 2.1 Data Sources
- Primary dataset available in multiple formats (.ods, .csv, .xlsx, .tsv)
- Recommendation: Use CSV format as primary source for:
	- Easy version control
	- Simple parsing
	- Universal compatibility
	- Text-based diff tracking

### 2.2 Data Structure Requirements
- Album metadata fields:
	- Title
	- Artist
	- Release date (with year extraction)
	- Genre tags (comma-separated)
	- Country/Location
	- Additional metadata (length, vocal style, etc.)

### 2.3 Data Challenges
- Tag normalization requirements:
	- Handle misspellings
	- Manage alternate naming conventions
	- Group similar tags
	- Maintain tag relationships
- Date handling:
	- Extract and standardize years
	- Handle partial date information
	- Track update timestamps
