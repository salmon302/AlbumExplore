# Tag System Technical Specification

## 1. Tag Analysis

### 1.1 Primary Tag Categories
Based on data analysis:
- Genre Tags (e.g., "Black metal", "Death metal", "Prog-metal")
- Style Modifiers (e.g., "Atmospheric", "Technical", "Melodic")
- Fusion Indicators (e.g., "Post-", "Progressive", "Avant-Garde")
- Regional/Cultural Tags (e.g., "Celtic", "Viking", "Medieval")

### 1.2 Tag Relationships
- Hierarchical (e.g., "Death metal" -> "Melodic Death metal")
- Compositional (e.g., "Atmospheric" + "Black metal")
- Fusion (e.g., "Post-metal" + "Blackgaze")
- Exclusive (e.g., "Clean" vs "Harsh" vocals)

## 2. Normalization System

### 2.1 Tag Standardization Rules
- Case normalization (lowercase base terms)
- Hyphenation standards (e.g., "post-metal" vs "post metal")
- Compound term handling (e.g., "deathcore" vs "death-core")
- Regional spelling variations (e.g., "metal-core" vs "metalcore")

### 2.2 Tag Grouping
- Primary genres
- Subgenres
- Style modifiers
- Technical characteristics
- Vocal styles
- Instrumental indicators

### 2.3 Tag Similarity Detection
- Edit distance calculation
- Common misspellings database
- Phonetic similarity matching
- Context-based grouping

## 3. Search and Filter System

### 3.1 Search Features
- Fuzzy matching
- Partial term matching
- Synonym matching
- Auto-completion
- Suggestion system

### 3.2 Filter States
- Inclusive (must have tag)
	- Weight: 1.0
	- Behavior: Required match
- Exclusive (must not have tag)
	- Weight: -1.0
	- Behavior: Automatic exclusion
- Neutral (ignored)
	- Weight: 0.0
	- Behavior: No impact

### 3.3 Filter Combinations
- AND operations between inclusive tags
- OR operations within tag groups
- NOT operations for exclusive tags
- Weight-based relevance scoring

## 4. Implementation Considerations

### 4.1 Data Structures
- Tag Trie for fast prefix matching
- Similarity Matrix for related tags
- Weighted Graph for tag relationships
- Bloom filters for quick exclusion checks

### 4.2 Performance Optimization
- Cached similarity calculations
- Precomputed relationship weights
- Indexed tag lookups
- Batch update processing

### 4.3 Update Management
- Version control for tag definitions
- Change tracking system
- Conflict resolution rules
- Migration path for evolving tags

## 5. Tag Statistics

### 5.1 Usage Metrics
- Frequency tracking
- Co-occurrence patterns
- Temporal trends
- Regional variations

### 5.2 Quality Metrics
- Consistency score
- Ambiguity index
- Relationship strength
- User feedback integration
