# Test Diagnostics Report

## Summary
- Total Tests: 172
- Pass Rate: 159 passed, 13 failed (92% pass rate)
- Status: Critical issues identified in visualization components

## Critical Issues

### 1. Arc/Chord Rendering
- Test Failures: test_arc_connection_visibility, test_chord_connection_visibility
- Issue: Connection thickness below minimum threshold
- Root Cause: Thickness calculation not respecting minimum bounds
- Impact: Connections too thin for visibility
- Current State: Thickness 0.5 vs required minimum 2.0

### 2. Data Interface
- Test Failure: test_get_album_connections
- Issue: Connection weight calculation mismatch
- Root Cause: Weight calculation not matching shared tag count
- Impact: Incorrect relationship strengths
- Current State: Weight 1.2 vs actual shared tags count 1

### 3. Network View
- Test Failures: test_label_rendering, test_node_selection
- Issue: Node positioning and interaction issues
- Root Cause: Coordinate system conversion errors
- Impact: Nodes positioned outside viewport, click interactions failing
- Current State: Node position (760,0) outside bounds (400,0)

### 4. Performance Issues
- Test Failure: test_rendering_performance
- Issue: Slow rendering times
- Root Cause: Inefficient layout calculations
- Impact: Poor user experience
- Current State: 5.34s render time vs 3.0s target

### 5. Responsive Design
- Test Failures: test_responsive_network_renderer, test_responsive_label_visibility
- Issue: Incorrect scaling and visibility
- Root Cause: Responsive manager not applying configurations
- Impact: Inconsistent display across screen sizes
- Current State: Node size 3.0 vs expected 2.4, labels visible when disabled

## Performance Metrics
- Network view: 5.34s (target: < 3.0s)
- Arc view: 0.73s (target: < 0.4s)
- Chord view: 0.34s (target: < 0.3s)
- Responsive updates: 0.005-0.011s (within target)

## Next Steps
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Fix minimum thickness enforcement in renderers
   - Correct weight calculation in data interface
   - Implement proper coordinate system conversion
   - Optimize rendering performance
   - Fix responsive scaling issues

2. Follow-up Tasks:
   - Add validation for renderer configurations
   - Implement comprehensive bounds checking
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Review responsive design system
