# Network Graph Performance Analysis

## Current Performance Metrics (2025-02-17)
- FPS: 6.3 (Concerning - target should be 30+ FPS)
- Frame Time: 159.9ms (Target should be <33ms for 30 FPS)
- Layout Processing: 13.5ms
- Other Operations: ~1ms combined

## Graph Characteristics
- Nodes: 100
- Edges: 1,940
- Density: 0.194 (High interconnectivity)
- Memory Usage: ~209KB

## Critical Issues
1. Low Frame Rate (6.3 FPS)
   - Indicates significant performance bottleneck
   - Primary impact on user experience
   - Well below target 30+ FPS

2. High Frame Time (159.9ms)
   - Layout processing consumes 13.5ms
   - Unaccounted time suggests potential hidden bottlenecks
   - Possible garbage collection or state management overhead

## Recommendations
