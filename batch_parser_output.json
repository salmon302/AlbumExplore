          "text": "Kansas was in the 70's the american answer to the british prog scene. They followed the scheme drawed by groups as Yes or Genesis but with more energy and the inclusion of a boogie-rock tune on each of their earlier LPs. Despite the fact that Robby Steinhardt was the only musician that went to a music school, the musicianship is nonetheless astonishing : Steve Walsh is a true gifted vocalist, Kerry Livgren is the main composer and plays the guitar and some synth parts and Phil Ehart is avery good drummer. Leftoverture is the best Kansas record and can easily be compared to its european equivalents. It contains american mainstream rock blended with symphonic prog rock elements. Great stuff !!!"

          "text": "THE classic Kansas album, it comes after a semi-dud, Leftoverture returns with the legendary logo and a Merlin-Ludwig DaVinci fantasy artwork and some dynamite songwriting. Still with the classic line-up, Leftoverture is the album that broke the group nationally and paved their way to international success. Part of the success of this album is the production, which managed to make this album sound unique and huge. This is the album that would be an inevitable reference to many future American bands (see last paragraph of my review), one that proved that US could also scream prog as well.Opening on the anthemic hit Wayward Son despite its length (5-mins was unusual for radio-friendly hits) and backed with strong material like The Wall and Miracles Out Of Nowhere, but it is clearly the proggier Cheyene Anthem and Magnum Opus, both closing the album, that the group strikes gold with. However, the AOR sound is still very much present throughout the album, but then again, it wouldn't be Kansas without it, uh??Of course this is their peak but As Mr Bonzo says in his review (now gone), it is hard to get used to this huge American sound., if you weren't bread with it Let's recognize that this is the album that will set the American Standard for decades to come (Starcastle, Cathedral, Spock's Beard, Somnambulist etc..) and is a downright classic. My fave track on this one is Cheyenne Anthem and of course Magnum Opus but I still think they had said most of it all on their debut album. A classic."

Here is some old time classic prog with the classic rock ditty \"Carry On My Wayward Son\" which was one on every K-TEL record for miles. This is in my opinion KANSAS' best offering of all time and certainly \"Magnum Opus\" is the best track they ever recorded...a true timeless masterpiece!"

Out of the standard concerning the European Progressive genre, this famous work is diverse, a special contamination between the best American tradition of classic rock and an epic progressive music, which could deserve the maximum score!! For instance the mini-suite \"Magnum Opus\" is a masterpiece, but also \"Cheyenne Anthem\", with his splendid central chorus-section and the final stunning epic instrumental, or once again the most typical US hard rock stuff, included within \"Carry on my Wayward Song\".Regarding of the explanations above, all these tracks make this album a must-have!!"

It reminds me of course BOSTON for the hard rock style and STYX for the progressive side. The keyboards may be floating as on \"Cheyenne Anthem\", and the organ and mood sounds are omnipresent. \"Carry On The Wayward Son\" is a big hit. The lead vocals, violins, bass and drums are good and present, as always."

          "text": "Heartland prog, which is to say earnest and even evangelical in tone but ultimately a flat facsimile of the genre's musical nooks and crannies. KANSAS had created a dialectic interpretation of what was originally a European phenomenon, adding country elements that included twangier vocal harmonies, fiddling and \"bible belt\" sentiment to prog's mystical soup. At its best, this music rocked and resonated simultaneously; look no further than the opening \"Carry On Wayward Son\" to see where \"Leftoverture\" works. It's in this hard-rocking, semi-mystical music that KANSAS found an audience, and tracks like \"What's On My Mind\" and \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\" were themselves influential, lighting the way for arena rockers Boston, FOREIGNER et al. At this stage, however, KANSAS was still borrowing elements from past masters -- bits of GENESIS, GENTLE GIANT and ELP pop up throughout. Rarely do they paint the sublime plateaus of GENESIS, the apocalyptic battles of ELP or the impossibly tight arrangements of GENTLE GIANT, but KANSAS remains in the ballpark of magic most of the way. The appropriately titled \"Magnum Opus\" especially manages to leave the earth in pursuit of higher learning, and is a journey Rush fans will enjoy. The music that remains is very good, from the Lamb-like \"The Wall\" to the inflated but impressive \"Opus Insert\".Just as the early music of RUSH succeeded more on moxie than method, \"Leftoverture\" is clearly good enough to seduce even jaded prog purists over time. True, compared to the English masters, \"Leftoverture\" is lyrically na\ufffdve and its complexity more bluster than brilliance, but so few bands took up the torch and got this far running with it that KANSAS deserves more credit than criticism."

          "text": "Thank you James Hill that we Americans can think with our brains sometimes ;-). Most criticism of Kansas is that they didn't stay true to progressive rock throughout their albums or career. This group played a variety of styles and I think that's why I like them so much. I comment on this one because it was a the one that defined them. They had three great albums before this and several good ones after but this one gave them headliner status. I grew up with this band from the first album onward. Kerry Livgren's songs have so much meaning to them. Heartfelt spiritual searching that all of us go through and identify with. Simple questions that have no answers except in the deepest regions of our own hearts (It's just love and miracles out of nowhere). Never mean spirited but not sappy either. Their music is both subtle and hard edged. So they had radio hits. So did Genesis, ELP, Focus, Yes, Frank Zappa and Jethro Tull. Does this take away from one essential point; That a band could survive and even thrive playing what they wanted not what they thought someone wanted them to play? I don't think so. They did so by not one person being greater than the whole. It was a band and without each member the sound and songs would have suffered. I used to think that classical music was an influence but I think that soundtracks was a better style are a better fit at least in Kerry Livgren penned songs. They set moods like Genesis did but in a totally different way. I love their melodies as one moves into another and then would just knock you down with some kick ass rock. They took along time getting known because no one wanted to play with them because they would blow other bands off the stage. Anyway, those are my memories and thoughts. Maybe not quite as sophisticated as the Europeans but then again not one of the Europeans could get down and dirty like these guys either and touch people who might never have been exposed to something higher than three chord rock. This album is a classic."

          "text": "One of the things that I like from Kansas is the mixture they did of Progressive Rock with Heavy Metal guitars. In one song one could hear \"delicate classical\" keyboards and violin followed by heavy metal distorted lead guitars.The lyrics of some of the songs are very good, like \"The Wall\" and \"Miracles out of nowhere\". In this album, Kerry Livgren was the main composer. The best songs in this album are \"Carry on wayward son\", \"The Wall\", \"Miracles out of nowhere\" (very influenced by classical music) and the \"weird song\" called \"Magnum opus\". I prefer the live versions of these songs from the \"Two for the show\" and \"Live at the Whisky\" albums, as they are played with more energy and feeling. But this \"Leftoverture\" album is very good too."

          "text": "Cassette confusionDon't be put off by the rather corny title, this is probably Kansas' best album. I have always considered them to be a bit \"second division\", in as much as there are to my mind plenty of other bands who do what Kansas do, better.To generalise, I find Kansas song writing to be rather weak. They know what they want to achieve, but often do not seem to quite get there. The other general criticism I have is in relation to the vocals. Robby Steinhardt and Steve Walsh are undoubtedly accomplished singers, but at least one of their voices is an acquired taste (forgive my ignorance, I do not know the band well enough to differentiate who is singing on each track). I also find that Kansas' songs do not always fit in well with their capabilities/limitations.Now that is out the way, to the good points of this album. The opening track (Or is it? See below!), \"Carry on wayward son\" is probably (along with \"Dust in the wind\") Kansas' best known song. It's an upbeat feel good song, with a very catchy hook, and some fine instrumental passages. The following track \"The wall\" is my favourite Kansas track. The vocals are stronger here than on any other song by the band. It is a melodic power ballad, with a superb, Wurlitzer like, keyboard solo to finish.Of the rest, \"Cheyenne anthem\" and \"Magnum Opus\" are among the best. The latter at 8 1/2 minutes is hardly \"magnum\", but they do still manage to split it into 6 sections!A solid album by a capable, if at times \"safe\", band. Worth exploring.I mentioned earlier about the \"first\" track. The cassette version I have lists the tracks in the order shown on this site. The cassette however actually plays in a completely different order, with \"Cheyenne anthem\" opening the album, and \"Carry on..\" kicking off side 2. Presumably this was to balance up the running times on the cassette."

          "text": "** Intermezzo - By the time I am about to write this review, I'm hearing \"Stargazer\" of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (\"Rising\" album) broadcasted by our local FM radio station. What a coincidence! \"Leftoverture\" was released about the same period (I guess) with Rainbow \"Rising\". Yeah . both of them have colored my teenage days. Powerful albums! Unfortunately, I cannot put my thoughts about \"rising\" as it is not boxed under prog category. Poor me . That's the impact on categorizing music under what so called \"genre\". Who's fault ? Our fault! The listeners. Yes, we categorized music. **Sorry for the above intermezzo, but it's true for me personally (or it may apply to some of you). The kind of music that the rock groups created during the creative year of 70s seem to share common \"nuances\" for me. I can feel it but I can not disburse it in words. Well, I think for those of you who were teenagers during 70s, you know exactly what I mean, as I can sense it now. Regardless which part of the world you were at that time. The 70's was really the glory years of rock music. Rock music was accessible by almost all people. Don't you think so?Yes, \"CARRY ON WAYWARD SON \" ..JRENG! was I think one of the colors of 70s music. The music is to me a kind of straight forward rock song. It may be categorized as prog as there are some tempo changes but it's still maintaining a rocking style. I like the voice line as well as the guitar work and piano during transition pieces. An energetic tune. I still remember those days when I watched the rock concert (accompanied by my big bro, Boedi - remember, I was just teenager - my mom did not allow me to go by myself)) in Jakarta where the performer was our local rock hero GOD BLESS covering this song. Fantastic performance. This song is suitable for cheering you up after you've gone thru a tiring day, eg. fed up with your boss, trapped in a long traffic jam, or experiencing a not so good relationship with your friend, spouse, etc. Play it ON man, you'll get your spirit UP! Yeah . count on my words!\"THE WALL\" is a melodic track in a sort of ballad mode with great lead guitar. The guitar melody at the very intro part of the track is really killing me .. Hmmmm ...!! Oh boy . what a wonderful melody!!! The other interesting part is when the clavinet sound backing up the voice line and then followed by tasty violin sound. Uuuuggghhhh ...great composition! The strong part of this track is, I think (in addition to the \"killing\" melody line), the transition pieces where a wide variety of instruments are used, including vibes. Brilliant!\"WHAT's ON MY MIND\" is a dynamic track in relatively fast tempo. The double guitar sound is really excellent. The music flows like typical rock song. Great vocal. \"MIRACLES OUT OF NOWHERE\" is my all-time favorite as it has relatively complex composition but it is crafted in a great tasty melody. The many instruments used to accentuate the music are blended nicely in one single composition: wonderful ballad rock music. \"Tell me where you're going to?\" is the part of its lyrics that people used to emulate this track. Observe the complexity of musical instruments' melody at transition on minute 2:30. Wow! Really stunning, my friend! Each instrument seems to sound in different direction but in a very nice harmony! I don't believe that human being has ever created this superb song! Really superb! Try it yourself! You will hardly disagree with me. I'm pretty sure!\"OPUS INSERT\" is a straight forward rock music with great organ sound and some acoustic guitar work. Nothing more that I can comment as the music is nice with some prog elements in the middle of the track using vibes (reminds me to Gentle Giant, actually). \"QUESTIONS OF MY CHILDHOOD\" has great harmony of keyboard and piano (played at the same time). However, the melody of this track is not really as tasty as the other tracks.\"CHEYENNE ANTHEM\" was the first track in the cassette edition that I purchased sometime in 76. (Thanks God, finally I could afford to buy the CD in 1998). Of course, I love this track as it starts beautifully with a great acoustic guitar rhythm and it climbs up to a faster tempo when all instruments take part.The concluding track \"MAGNUM OPUS\" is another all-time favorite track for me. It has everything for a progressive rock track: relatively complex, changing tempos, great transitions and the use of many instruments to generate various sounds. The vocal line at the opening part is very melodic. The rest of the track has no vocal but full with exploration of musical instruments in relatively complex composition, relatively fast tempo, excellent harmony. (Sometime in the year 2000, I was listening to the metal program in our local FM station. The broadcaster mentioned that \"Magnum Opus\" was the first inspiration for progressive metal bands. Was that true? I don't know. But it might be, because it has a sort of guitar riffs. Do you think so? If you agree, this album then must be a \"masterpiece\", because it has laid a solid foundation in the history of progressive metal! ).Overall, this album is a \"masterpiece\"! It deserves for 5 / 5 rating. Powerful songwriting, tight structure and composition, excellent performance, great cover and excellent sonic quality of the CD. (Just a little note: if you do not mind, I would humbly say \"please ignore any review in this page or other page that rate this album less than 4/5\". Sorry . it's not my intention to undermine other reviewers' views. Indeed, I'm not a die hard fan of Kansas, but this album is absolutely a masterpiece. I have to be fair. Big apology for my \"na\ufffdve-ness\" but I'm telling you from my heart. Please try it yourself. Nyuwun sewu njih .) GW, Indonesia."

The're in a K-Mart parking lot and listening to 'their' song: Dust in the Wind.Oh man, I saw sooo many country guys trying to impress girls by playing this song on their cheap guitars. And of course, the girls fell for those guys, 'cause guys knew the making out potential of this song. And then the legends wrotes itself. Kansas became THE band who wrote Dust in The Wind. Man I always disliked that sound quite sincerely. So when I finded out that out that this song was not a good representation of their overall work, I bought Leftoverture.To my surprise I didn't knew they wrote Carry On Wayward Son. I mean, I knew the melody, but I didn't known Kansas wrote it. Once again, my jaw kinda hardened as I realized that I perhaps wasted my money. But then came Miracles Out of Nowhere, Cheyenne Antem and the highly honorable Magnum Opus. Bam! I was sold to this super album. I didn't knew how good this band was before. And to find an american band who rocks this good and also could teach a lesson or two to ELP and Yes got me more happier.The song writing is excellent. They use a very great range of keyboards, some xylophone, dirty guitars when needed and when the viola kicks in, it sets the whole thing on fire. I'm happy to own a piece what America did best in the 70's. Honestly, I'm very impressed by the quality and yet accessible work of Kansas.A surprisingly good record with a somewhat low amount of cheesyness. If you want two North American band of the 70's, I'd say to go with Rush and Kansas."

          "text": "What an opening statement this album makes! In the multi-dimension heavy rocker Carry On Wayward Son, Kansas has one of the greatest prog-inflected singles of all time. I love everything about it ... the exuberant layered vocals, poignant lyrics, searing organ, heavy guitar, understated piano-playing, the fiery break, and the airtight rhythm section. It was the single that helped Kansas break through to the big time but that shouldn't take anything away from one of Kerry Livgren's finest compositions.It's not the only blockbuster on this album. Magnum Opus is one intense, rewarding journey that has everything from Steve Walsh's moody vibe-palying to Rich Williams' scorching guitar leads. It's a song of real stature. Cheyenne Anthem (thematically at least) is like a sequel to their greatest prog acheivement Song For America and it's a great song. Despite a cheesy children's choir and a dubious polka-ish rhythm that takes over at one point, there are so many delicate bits that I can't resist in this song. Miracles Out Of Nowhere is another indisutable Kansas classic, bringing back some much needed violin and synth leads that I often finded are needed to take a Kansas song to the next level. I also love the organ-led mid section to bits ... what a great bit of prog playing!The Wall is one of those songs I find a little over-rated. Its melody and style are too meandering for my tastes and I actually find it boring. Same goes for Opus Insert, which has some nice interludes, but is generally forgettable. What's On My Mind blends a punchy rock riff with a shockingly poppy verse, but like The Wall I find it overrated. Questions Of My Childhood is another song with a strong pop touch, although the arrangements save this one from the scrapheap.The bonus tracks on my CD are virtually note-perfect live versions of Carry On Wayward Son and Cheyenne Anthem, proving to those who didn't already know just what a powerful band Kansas was at its prime. In fact I prefer the live version of Cheyenne Anthem to its studio counterpart. ... 80% on the MPV scale"

          "text": "In the Seventies Kansas created a captivating blend of classical music, hardrock and 'symphonic rock'. A highly acclaimed album is \"Leftoverture\", many progheads consider this as their best studio work. I disagree because the first two are my favorite albums but I would like to have a listen to the final track \"Magnum opus\" (what's in a name?), in my opinion their most symphonic and mature composition. The intro contains a lot of violin, one of their trademarks. Then the music continues with a bombastic outburst, a short distorted guitar solo and vibraphone/piano interplay. The climates changes when a howling electric guitar solo and a slow rhythm symbolise the lyrics: \"only howling at the moon\". After a short break with floods of organ, an up-tempo rhythm follows with exciting violin/electric guitar interplay, soon joined by spectacular and catchy synthesizer flights. Then again that typical Kansas-sound: heavy and bombastic with swirling interplay between the fiery electric guitar, violin and organ. Lots of changing climates follow: from mellow with twanging electric guitar and vibraphone till bombastic with heavy electric guitar runs and great violinplay. The 'grand finale' contains spectacular synthesizer flights (use of pitchbend), a sparkling piano and finally propulsive interplay between the electric guitar and the violin, KANSAS AT IT'S BEST!"

          "text": "3.4 stars.This is an album that sounds like neo-prog without being in that period. I call it neo-prog because it has a sound very similar to Spock's Beard. This album doesn't give overly beautiful moments, as Yes/Genesis could give with no effort. However, this is an easy prog-lite album that can be enjoyed.Carry on Wayward Son is easily the best song from Kansas. The melodies are incredibly catchy and well arranged, and the guitar riffing rivals Jimmi Page's best riffs. The song also goes through many different sections under its short duration. Excellent!Unfortunately, what follows does not reach that level. However, it is still interesting enough prog-pop. The Wall is a melodic nice tune. What's In My Mind is a hard rocker that reminds me of Gentle Giant for some reason. Miracles out of Nowhere is an organ-driven song with dynamic moments. \"Opus Island\" is a nice soft rock track with good keyboard playing. \"Questions of My Childhood\" for some reason doesn't click for me. Cheyenne Anthem is a good track that begins as a ballad, and then increases tempo and intensity. The piano work is excellent here.The album concludes with \"Magnum Opus\", being the other highlight of this album. It is very dynamic, complex, virtuosic, and shall I say .. Intense!! I am sure that most, if not all, progressive rock fans will find something in this track to adore. The riffs are very memorable, the guitar solo in the beginning is brilliant, and the song goes through many phases.While I do not agree with the high rating of the album, I consider this a fine album that could be like by almost everybody. It is very accessible, yet prog enough. It may be a good place to start if you want to start collecting American Prog and Neo-prog music (especially Spock's Beard).1. Carry on wayward son (9.5/10) 2. The wall (7/10) 3. What's on my mind (6/10) 4. Miracles out of nowhere (6/10) 5. Opus insert (6.5/10) 6. Questions of my childhood (4/10) 7. Cheyenne anthem (7.5/10) 8. Magnum opus (8.5/10)My Grade : C+"

          "text": "I can understand why Kansas are not to many prog lovers' taste. Progressive rock is essentially European (though not exclusively English) in origins and atmosphere, and Kansas' music shows clear American influences. Of course, there's the country-flavoured sound of Robbie Steinhardt's violin, but the whole scope of their music feels different from that of English and Continental prog bands. Take Steve Walsh's voice, for instance: he's one of the greatest singers in the genre, and his performance on \"Leftoverture\" is nothing short of stunning - however, his singing style is quite different from other prog greats. His voice soars with clarity and power, but it can also sound a bit too melodramatic to ears accustomed to, say, Lake or Richard Sinclair's quintessentially English delivery or Gabriel's brooding intensity.That said, though, \"Leftoverture\" is without any doubt a great album, possibly Kansas' finest hour. It blends true-blue, progressive moments with lots of strong, memorable melodies, heavy guitar riffs and sweeping, romantic violin interludes, magnificent vocal interplay from Walsh and Robbie Steinhardt and uplifting lyrics, not as cloyingly preachy as Livgren's output would become in later years. It is a complex record which is at the same time quite easy on the ear, unlike its follower, the equally excellent but somehow darker \"Point of Know Return\". Hit single \"Carry On Wayward Son\" has a very catchy chorus, but some beautiful instrumental passages lurk behind its apparent accessibility. The album's highlights , however, besides the largely instrumental \"Magnum Opus\" (the most traditionally prog track on the record), are the melodic, majestic \"The Wall\" and especially \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\", which boasts some of Steinhardt's best violin playing, great vocals by Walsh and heartwarming lyrics. Even though in the '80s they became a run-of-the-mill AOR band with strong confessional leanings, the contribution of Kansas to the development of American prog rock cannot be neglected. Together with Rainbow, they should also be mentioned as the forerunners of Dream Theater's brand of prog-metal. \"Leftoverture\" may not be an essential masterpiece of prog music, but it's more than certainly an excellent, highly recommended addition to anyone's collection."

          "text": "Every now and then I like to rifle through the bargain bins and pull out an LP with a promising looking cover and buy it just for the sake of it. \"Leftoverture\" was one such purchase, and I pulled the cans on, cranked up the volume, and waited for the torrents of cheesey Spinal Tap related drivel to spew forth.Instead, for my \ufffd1, I got the shock of my life - a bona fide Prog Rock album, with fewer similarities to Boston than I was expecting, and more similarities to Gentle Giant!!I found flavours of every classic Prog Rock band bar Jethro Tull in here, which you might think would make it sound awfully derivative - but the truth is, that it's in no way awful, and only really slightly derivative - there's a unique \"Kansas\" vibe running through the entire album.Don't get me wrong, \"Leftoverture\" is not in the same league or even vein as GG or the \"Classics\" (except for \"Magnum Opus\"), it is closer in sound to Boston, the songs rarely stretch beyond 5 minutes; It's not a pure Prog Rock album, but it's about as close to Prog Rock as you're going to get on the West side of the Atlantic during the 1970s, and a worthy investment of your hard-earned Prog tokens.A very strong 4 Stars - an excellent addition to any collection of Prog Rock, if only for \"Magnum Opus\" and \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\". There are other worthy moments here too - but for those, you're going to have to read the long bits :0)A vocal intro strongly reminiscent of Styx leads to a strong section of riffola and soloing with tasty organ undercurrents, and multiple riff and texture changes. When the verse starts, we're in a new melodic territory that has flavours of Uriah Heep. A strongly constructed song emerges - standard rock format, but cleverly disguised with piano and vocal layers, then a well constructed bridge in an A-B-A-C-A format seguing back to the chorus featuring rhythmic variants - that's what I mean by well constructed. There's nothing majorly new about the riffing, but it all has that spontaneous and organic feel that comes about when the entire song is concieved from a single base of ideas and then had plenty of improv worked in.\"The Wall\" is nothing like anything on the Pink Floyd album - indeed, when it kicked in, I thought for a second or two that I might be listening to a long-lost Fish-era Marillion number - there are a vew similarities, especially in the early emotional guitar solo, that carry a flavour of \"Forgotten Sons\". There's a nice folky flavour underpinning this song, heightened by a violin. Little flavours of Genesis drift through, but ultimately the feel of this song is of a very well constructed ballad with prog-style textures, and it's all a little too \"pleasant\" for my taste. The MGM ending just seals this one.\"What's on My Mind\" is a Boston-style rocker... although I have to concede that \"Leftoverture\" predates Boston... Imagine Free or Bad Company with added organ and you're nearly there. There's an odd change halfway through which seems to hint at \"Boogie Nights\", and I'm left a little uneasy about the overall construction here. What is on the mind of the writer???The first song over 5 minutse, \"Miracles out of nowhere\" is much more like it, as far as Prog Rock is concerned - if up to now you had, like me, felt that this isn't really a Prog album, this song is one that will change your mind, despite the slightly cheesey chorus. The violin continues the folk-like flavour, and the swirls of organ combined with the \"tough\" bass sound drive the music forwards in a kind of Yes style, but with better vocals. The real piece of prog starts with the fugue that suddenly pipes up - all instruments partaking, with multiple organ and string sounds creating a dense texture that hides the time signatures very well - multiple listens are required to work these out, so I'll leave that to those who care... This is just brilliant Prog Rock of the finest quality, and is what really surprised me about this album. The other surprise is that not only is this great quality Prog, but the melodies are strong too - always a tricky thing to achieve when you're working with complex material.Miracles out of nowhere? Yeah - that works!Flipping the vinyl over, I'm now charged up for more of this - the Rock is hugely enjoyable, and the Prog more than just a bonus - it's really good.\"Opus Insert\" continues with the flavours of Yes with good vocals - although admittedly, the harmonies are fairly weak. The time changes are nice, and the textures are great - the sudden move to Zappa-like textures is a great and welcome surprise, although the perfect cadences with flourishes spoil the effect. We are later treated to a swirling organ section (Mmmm), that segues into a Moog-led reprise of the main tune - all too briefly, sadly.Not so solidly in Prog territory, \"Questions of my childhood\" feels like a kind of Prog- flavoured hit single, and is a bit \"more of the same\", in that it solidifies the style of this album, which otherwise might be feeling a little inconsistent, with the swinging back and forwards between standard rock and Prog. The violin solo is particularly notable, and I like the way it's picked up by the keyboard.\"Cheyenne anthem\" probably carries the cheesiest lyrics on the entire album - and begins more strongly in the folk-style flavour. A piano-driven section follows - and I can't help but be mystified, as I fail to relate the instrumental textures with the words. The tunes are strong, though, and I particularly like the children's choir, that is beautifully picked up by vibes and violin and driven into a passage that carries a strong Gentle Giant flavour... until it goes pear-shaped, with an Oom-pah bass line driving some terribly noodling solos. This has stronger flavours of Barnum than Cheyenne Indians, in truth. We kind of forgive Kansas with some of the stronger proggy material that goes in here, but it's all a kind of random pastiche, weakly linked by thematic ideas, then a recapitulated intro, with out-of-tune female (or possibly falsetto) solo - quite nasty. The musical development that follows, though, is actually quite good.And finally \"Magnum Opus\" - the 8 and a half minuter that I've been waiting for.This begins strongly in Prog Rock territory, with a large sound with great washes of keyboard, leading to a bass solo that seems oddly out of place - in a Krautrock kind of way, but the vibes that follow seem to bring the focus back. Talking of Focus, an Akkerman-style solo brings us to the verse, and all is Prog textures, lush sounds... and lyrics about music. This segues into an ELP(without the boxing gloves) flavoured riff, with the violin creating new and exciting textures. Kansas pull out all the stops and really get into the Prog rock groove with this - it's a pity, in a way, that this is the streaming mp3 on this site, as it really is the very best and most proggy track on the entire album - a superb work that lives up to its auspicious title very well.Marimbas and picked guitar with washes of Hammond and rich bass bring another beautiful texture exploration to the fore - I'm reminded of King Crimson here somehow - and the music builds to a sharply angular guitar solo full of dive-bombing and other goodies...Why am I writing about this track - listen to the streaming mp3!!!If you like the mp3, buy the album (as cheaply as you can).If you don't like the mp3, you don't like Prog.:o)"

          "text": "Highly regarded as Kansas' masterpiece (with good reason), this album sounds just as good today as it did back in the 70's. Leftoverture also boasts as having one of the best album openers in history with \"Carry On Wayward Son\". Sure, we've all heard it a ton of times; however, when you view the overall body of work in Leftoverture, \"Carry On...\" is a perfect way to kick off the album. Excellent groove in the middle with Ehart and Hope supplying that classic rhythm section.I've always considered \"The Wall\" as one of Kansas' best song. Walsh is such an emotional singer, and the way his vocals start off soft and then just take off gives me goosebumps. Absolutely one of the best voices in music history!\"Cheyenne Anthem\" is another song that sticks out. I never really think of how much I missed Steinhardt until I listen to Leftoverture. He's got great moments throughout the album, but his vocals and violin truly make this a beautiful track.And, of course, you cannot forget \"Magnum Opus\". A true progressive classic that showcases Kansas as a group of world class musicians. That classic and wicked bass solo towards the beginning with Dave Hope just hits you in your innards. Today's incarnation of Kansas has Billy Greer, who provides great accompanying vocals; however, when it comes to the bass, then it's hard to top Hope. He's such an underrated bassist...and he and Ehart worked perfectly together."

          "text": "There have probably been tens of thousands of reviews of Leftoverture in various magazine and newspaper archives (and now all over the web) since it released thirty years ago. One has to wonder if there is anything left to say. But I feel like trying anyway.This album was all over the radio the year my family and I moved to Kansas, and it was the one that first introduced me to the band. During this time, Kansas (the band) could, and did, play to crowds of tens of thousands of rabid fans in Kansas (the state). The first time I saw them was the summer after this album released in Wichita Kansas, and the crowd of 15,000 or so booed opening act Cheap Trick off the stage just to get Kansas up there sooner. And this was only three years removed from their staged audition for Kirschner scout Wally Gold in a cowboy bar in tiny Ellenwood Kansas. Most fans were new, and hadn\u2019t yet discovered the first three albums yet. Back then you couldn\u2019t go anywhere in the state without hearing \u201cQuestions of My Childhood\u201d or \u201cCarry on Wayward Son\u201d blasting out of the windows of nearly every car being driven by anyone under the age of twenty. Those were heady times for the band.But on to the album. The first thing I\u2019ll say about this album is that it is best listened to while in a large-engine car driven at the highest possible speed, and with no regard whatsoever for the personal safety of yourself or those around you. Or at least that has been my experience. A little organic stimulation doesn\u2019t hurt either.The first copy of this album I owned was on 8-track tape. Back then I had a pair of Nova 6 house speakers in walnut cabinets that graced the back seat of my 1974 Dodge \u2018Hang-Ten\u2019, which also had an in-dash 8-track player. Actually, a lot of kids back in Kansas had goofy getups like that. The point is, the 8-track version of Leftoverture was laid out completely differently from the album version (and at the time cassettes were really only for pussies). This was of course years before CD\u2019s became the norm.Anyway, the songs had to be arranged differently on 8-track to allow for a roughly equal amount of recording time on each of the four \u2018programs\u2019. The order on 8- track then, was- Opus Insert - Miracles Out of Nowhere - Questions of My Childhood - Cheyenne Anthem - Magnum Opus - The Wall - What\u2019s on My Mind - Carry on Wayward SonSo if you listen to the songs in that order (and while driving madly down a country road with dual 60-watt speakers cranked to \u201811\u2019), you get a completely different feel than if you listen to the CD layout on an iPod in your college dorm room, or on your PC\u2019s Media Player. The album sounds much more like Masque, which was recorded in the same Bogaloosa Louisiana studio the year prior. So I\u2019ll comment on each track in this order, which I\u2019m more familiar with. Amen.\u201cOpus Insert\u201d has typical Livgren lyrics, \u201cthere\u2019s a message in every word, and it\u2019s more than the word you heard\u2026\u201d. The real beauty here is the very tight rhythm line Phil Ehart and Dave Hope lay down, perfectly accompanied by Steve Walsh\u2019s voice at its prime, as well as his masterful keyboards. This is the Kansas \u2018any-song\u2019, as in it would have sounded good on any of their albums.Walsh\u2019s greatest vocal achievement has to be \u201cMiracles Out of Nowhere\u201d. Steinhardt is good too, but his violin work far outshines his vocals. Back then the band played this pretty much all the time in concert. Today Steve can\u2019t hit the notes, but this is one song that just flat out thunders on a good set of speakers. This one should have been a single.The \u201cQuestions of My Childhood\u201d may have been intended as a single, and I\u2019ve heard there was a video released, but this was pre-MTV so I never had a chance to see it. More incredible violin work here too, and Walsh just flat belts out the lyrics. Speaking of lyrics, this one is really an interesting work. Livgren wrote most of the songs on Leftoverture because, as he has said many times, he was \u201cincredibly prolific\u201d at the time. This was his pre-Christian period, but the guy was always rabidly searching for some kind of meaning in his life (myself, just being a juke-box hero at the time would have been pretty meaningful, but that\u2019s just me). At the time he was living in his parent\u2019s basement, years out of high school and spending most of his time and money just trying to eke out a living and hit the big time with the band. This is one of the songs that came out of a basement session while trying to put something together for their upcoming recording session. If you read the lyrics it almost seems to me like Kerry started each verse with his \u2018searching without finding\u2019 theme (\u201cI don\ufffdt need to face a world of disillusion, I\ufffdve come to one conclusion that I know you know is true; in the game of silent searching\u201d), but since he wasn\u2019t \u2018finding\u2019 at the time, Walsh came in and finished them as some sort of weird love song (\u201cthe cost of love is rising, and I\ufffdm just now realizing I\ufffdd be better of with you\u201d). Come on, you try it:Kerry \u2013 \u201cCan you help me find the answers, can you tell the way I feel? Will you stay with me forever\u201d: Steve \u2013 \u201cjust stay with me tonight, and we can talk about tomorrow if it all works out alright\u201d.See what I mean?Maybe its just me.\u201cCheyenne Anthem\u201d has got to be the greatest song on this album, if not the best thing Kansas ever did. Okay, maybe that\u2019s a bit over-the-top, but I am a Kansas fan after all \u2013 one should expect that from us. There\u2019s a story that Walsh brought another song into rehearsal the day Livgren brought in Anthem, but after Steve heard it he wouldn\u2019t show his song to the rest of the band. Walsh said years later that he never liked this song, and that the extended part on the middle sounded like music for a Warner Brothers cartoon. It might, but at the time the band was clicking on all cylinders for this one. The slow crescendo that builds with Walsh\u2019s keyboards and Steinhardt\u2019s violin is totally Ravel\u2019s Bolero, but its so over-the-top that if you\u2019re fifteen years old and full of testosterone, it can make you almost go Syd Barrett mad. This one is timeless and I still play it a lot early in the morning \u2013 much better than coffee.\u201cMagnum Opus\u201d just demonstrates how on-fire Kerry Livgren was as an arranger during the recording of this album. The various parts are musical doodling from each individual band member, but put together by Livgren, they sound like the closest thing to a truly progressive work from this band that probably exists. This song stands with the best of the European music of that day, in my opinion.Kerry has said in interviews that \u201cThe Wall\u201d was the best thing he ever wrote for Kansas. I\u2019m not sure I agree with that, but it definitely summed up the state of his mind at the time. I can picture him sitting in front of the beat-up piano his father bought him in his parent\u2019s basement. He just spent two years playing roughly 500 concerts all over the place, having also recorded three albums in the space of less than two years. His management had the band on a tight leash to produce a commercially viable album to leverage the exposure they\u2019d gained from constant touring. Yet Kerry was still \u2018on salary\u2019 for a few hundred dollars a month from the label, still toured in a crappy old school bus, and still lived in his parent\u2019s house. The word \u2018depression\u2019 comes to mind. From all that, plus his obsession with deep thinking, comes a perfect synopsis of where he was emotionally and spiritually at that time. Three years before he takes the Christian plunge, he has previewed his \u2018testimony\u2019. Pretty fascinating, no matter what your religious persuasions.\u201cWhat\u2019s on My Mind\u201d is the one I always hoped was playing whenever my car\u2019s speedometer hit 100 mph. I truly believed at the time that there wasn\u2019t a note in human hearing range that Steve Walsh could not hit. He tried several of them on this one. These have to be Walsh lyrics, although the actual owner of them seems to be somewhat in question. This is just a rocker, much like \u201cRelentless\u201d and \u201cLoner\u201d from Audio-Visions (hmmm, \u201cRelentless\u201d was a Livgren tune).There\u2019s really nothing to add about \u201cCarry on Wayward Son\u201d that hasn\u2019t already been said. Is there anyone alive in this world who even remotely cares about western music that hasn\u2019t heard this song?So anyway, enough rambling. I have tried very hard not to obsess on Kansas album reviews on the Archives, but this was a slow evening and I figured the time was right. Everyone who knows this album has well-formed opinions that probably won\u2019t be changed, certainly not by the nostalgic ramblings of a aging forum troll. But this is one great album, and I didn\u2019t even get into the great cover artwork.Spring is coming, summer will soon be here. Get yourself a good copy of this one and stick it in your car\u2019s stereo. If you don\u2019t have a car, go find someone who does. Drive real fast somewhere desolate, and crank it up. Kansas may never have a place at the table with the elite of progressive music icons, but if this album can\u2019t get your heart racing and your imagination flowing, you should probably check your pulse and think about making some serious lifestyle changes, because you have become either dead, or an old codger.peace"

          "text": "When I started to listen Prog at the age of 12 (Around 1976 or 1977), already the golden era of Classic Symphonic Prog had ended, Genesis was trying to survive without Gabriel and Hackett, Going for the One was not what some of us expected and ELP was not the same band than in 1974.The only remaining founder of the genre still to reach their peak was KANSAS and what better way to start a long term musical relation than with \"Leftoverture\", the album with which the Topeka kids reached the perfect balance between artistic quality and economic success, something hard in Progressive Rock because only a few bands of the genre managed to be popular without selling out and KANSAS is one of this strange cases.Still some people try to dismiss the achievements of KANSAS, I read reviews in which they are called Pomp Rock, rednecks or mediocre AOR band, mostly from people who don't have the knowledge of what KANSAS did in their early years and probably only heard Dust in the Wind.One of one of the main problems with this guys is that they were born in USA and not in big city but in the heart of the tornado corridor and committed the crime to use a slight touch of their native music (Country) in their albums, but except for some snobs this is not a sin, by the contrary the perfect mixture of Symphonic structure with Hard Rock and even Country Music made of this album one of the richest expressions of Progressive Rock.Another problem is that they managed to be successful, well this was forgiven in Pink Floyd, Yes and even ELP but of course not in KANSAS, but at the end who cares for negative opinions if we can let their music prove the contrary.\"Leftoverture\" is simply a great album, not a single filler or weak track, of course each one of us has our favorite tune, but all the songs are solid. The particular and nostalgic sound of the band relies in their beautiful melodies and in the rare fact that they left keyboards in the background giving Robby Steinhardt's violin the main role of the performance, they can rock hard and bring tears to our eyes without any problem, as I said before, the perfect balance.It's hard to chose a favorite track because all are extremely good, but I always had a soft spot for \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\", the vocal duet between Robby and Steve Walsh in the peak of his vocal abilities is amazing, we're talking about a wonderful song, incredibly complex combined with a beautiful melody as few tracks in the genre.Other great songs are the classic \"Opus Insert\" where Steve Walsh's voice is really amazing, after listening a few months ago I can't believe he was able to reach such a variety of different ranges without any problem and his work with the keyboards is also impeccable. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't mentioned Phil Ehart's perfect timing and precision with the drums, an underrated percussionist.\"Cheyenne Anthem\" is another example of great and complex Symphonic structure that starts a bit soft, making us expect it's a nostalgic ballad about the native Americans but then the piano and Steve's vocals leads to a breathtaking instrumental section where KANSAS hit the listener with all they have and to close it Robby Steinhardt and his magic classical violin with a slight taste of country music add the required drama, another brilliant track.Of course I can't forget about \"Magnum Opus\", a song that proves KANSAS released extremely elaborate music, dramatic time changes, synchronized team work between Robby plus the keyboards by Steve Walsh and Kerry Livegren. It's simply unbelievable that after listening this masterpiece, still some people want to lump them with all the AOR USA bands from late 70's/Early 80's,I don't need to talk about the rest of the songs because there are enough reviews here and only must add that if you're not afraid of nostalgic and sensible music, with extreme Hard Rock sections, this is your album but if you believe that popularity and melodic Prog suck, better don't buy \"Leftoverture\" because you will be disappointed.I'm in the first group of Progheads and honestly believe this album is a forgotten gem that should be in the top 10 or 20 albums of any Progressive Rock catalogue.Five solid stars for a solid album."

Kansas has an unique american sound, you can recognize from miles, this sound define later on the american standards in prog music. After all Kansas did a great job on this album. Well done, full of complex music, intristing arangements, Magnum opus is one of the best prog tracks i ever hered, and one of the best from them, no doubt. A 4 star album, check it worth a couple of spins. One of the best from '70, in my opinion."

At a young age Kerry Livgren was looking for spiritual enlightenment and this is reflected in his lyrics..\"The moment is a masterpiece, the weight of indecision\ufffds in the air It\ufffds standing there, the symbol and the sum of all that\ufffds me It\ufffds just a travesty, towering, blocking out the light and blinding me I want to see\"Definitely one of Livgren\ufffds strongest compositions. A fine performance by Steve Walsh!\"What\ufffds on my mind\" is probably the most straight forward rocker on this album, with Steve Walsh sounding a lot like Paul Rodgers of Bad Company (Rodgers is one of Wash\ufffds favourite vocalists)\"Miracles out of Nowhere\" has some beautiful acoustic segments and some great lyrics. I especially like the part where he describes someone\ufffds mother\"And though your body\ufffds ailin\ufffdyou, your mind is just like new Tell me where you\ufffdre going to?\"\"Opus Insert\" has some very comforting lyrics telling us that the spirit is surrounding us all! Some people say that lyrics aren\ufffdt that important, but in the case of Kansas, the lyrics are one of the best things about this band!\"Questions of my childhood\" is another song with spiritual lyrics and beautiful musical time changes to accompany them.\"Cheyenne Anthem\" is one of Livgren\ufffds songs dealing with the mortality of man. Steinhardt shares the vocals with Wash on this one. This is a song that gives me goose bumps!The album closes with the epic \"Magnum Opus\" , an instrumental divided into six parts. This is an amazing musical journey (especially on headphones)One of the greatest albums ever made."

          "text": "Like most people I became aware of KANSAS through their massive hit \"Carry On Wayward Son\" a track that made them famous world-wide. Unfortunately like a lot of great tunes from the seventies i've heard it hundreds of times over the last 30 some years.There is definetly a mid-west American feel to this record, except for the song just mentioned along with \"Cheyenne Anthem\" and \"Magnum Opus\" which are not coincidently my top three tracks. The rest of the songs inbetween really don't do anything for me, in fact I dislike them quite a bit.\"Carry On Wayward Son\" is larger than life with it's thoughtful and emotional lyrics and Walsh's powerful vocals that are accompanied with amazing guitar, piano and organ playing. I like when the heavy sound first comes in with organ.Then the guitar lights it up. Oh and that line \"My charade is the event of the season\" has always been a favourite. I'm just so tired of it.\"The Wall\" has a nice guitar melody and well done lyrics. I personally feel that \"What's On My Mind\" and \"Questions Of My Childhood\" both sound a little dated. Love the violin on \"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\" though. \"Opus Insert\" is catchy. \"Cheyenne Anthem\" is a cool song (and my favourite) that doesn't sound like the others.The children's choir is a nice touch as well. The best parts are the beginning and ending. \"Magnum Opus\" is the proggiest tune which gives each member of the band a chance to show off their skills.Just not a fan of this one."

          "text": "It was june when the first (small) summit of PA took place in my own town, Bassano. The first time ever in Italy. There were only me and Raffaella (aka Ghost Rider). She was there for a convention about tolkenian iconography and we went in my beloved progrock shop \"Pickuprecords\". While checking the huge amount of cds it happened we saw Kansas. Raffaella recommended me their Leftoverture album of which I had only listened a track or two, never intended to purchase it before. Strange thing, I don't even know why.So I followed her recommendation and bought the record.After so many listenings all I can say it that this is really more than an excellent record, borderline to the masterpiece status! Eight exciting tracks with a certain \"Magnum Opus\" as a closer. The title speaks for itself! Many shifting mood and accelerations. Wonderful keyboards' parts and aggressive electric guitar. This is really an all time classic!I would like to add my personal appreciation after the many I've read on this site. Kansas are certainly one of the most relevant classic prog bands, with the positive remark of being so \"american\". In fact they don't seem to emulate any of the european Giants but offer a wise combining of dramatic scenes with sparse touches of humour. All based upon the US flavour. Their own way of prog, sure. But not only. My mind is captured when I listen Leftoverture and only now I can completely understand where even some contemporary- beyond-suspicion-european prog band took their inspiration. Just take an italian one like Il Castello di Atlante, for example. I always thought that their main references were Quella Vecchia Locanda for the use of violin. How wrong I was! Their sound appears, instead, to be \"strangely\" near to that of Kansas in the more \"acoustic\" interludes as in \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\".In short, Leftoverture is only but the starting point for me discovering Kansas' respectable discography.4.5 stars."

Kerry Livgren's masterful work is evident on every track, but most notably on \"What's On My Mind\". That opening riff is mindblowing!Other songs, however, including \"Questions Of My Childhood\" and \"Cheyenne Anthem\" are disappointing tracks, and you should just skip them. Not terrible, just not worth the listen. \"Magnum Opus\" is an overrated track as well. I do not see the need to call it 'Magnum' as it is only eight and a half minutes in length. The two bonus tracks are nothing special, when I listen to this album I end it before the bonus tracks.So all in all, like I said before, this is a solid prog album and it was one of America's only answer to the British progressive movement. I think the good outweighs the bad, but I can still only call it average."

          "text": "At the time I purchased \"Leftoverture\" (in 1975) , I thought it was the follow-up of \"Song For America\" which I was really found of. In those days there was not that much publicity for a band like Kansas in Europe (I live in Belgium). The design of the cover artwork is rather creative and original.\"Carry On My Wayward Son\" is a classic Kansas opening track : very good musicianship, high-pitched but strong vocals. Actually, a great hard-rock song. It will be one of of their standards for the years to come and their first real hit-single.\"The Wall\" is a beautiful song : very melodious and charming more in the style of their earlier work. Vocals are quite emotional and the background violin is just superb. A wonderful piano break in the middle-part demontrates how refined this band could be. A really beautiful song.\"What's On My Mind\" is a pure hard rock song. It reminds me of \"Down the Road\" : good riff and guitar break, great rythmics. Another Purple influenced track, I would say. With \"Miracles out of Nowhere\" we enter again into the world of Kansas : a longer composition, very harmonious vocals, mellow chorus, lots of research in the instrumental backgrounds. But something is missing to make it a real great song. Maybe too sweet, although the last 1'30\" is quite rocky and really fabulous.B-side of the vinyl starts with \"Opus Insert\". Another good rock tune : at times heavier but almost classical at others. Nice finale. The intro of \"Questions Of My Childhood\" is rather promising but the song as such is probably the weakest track of the album (but there is always a weaker track on an album, right) ? This works almost as a filler but since the track is very short, there is not too many damage.I would have hoped more from \"Cheyenne Anthem\", a vibrant homage to this great Indian nation extermined by the white man. Even if the lyrics are explicit, the song is mellowish and a bit (too) repetitive. The second part features a nice instrumental break.The closing number \"Magnum Opus\" stars with a \"Indian\" flavour. Great and extended musical intro (like they produced on \"Song For America\"). At itmes, this number sounds as if Keith Emerson is playing the keys (a bit pompous if you see what I mean). It is a complex song with lots of theme changes. Hard-rocking for most of it with strong guitar work. Most of this number is instrumental (which is fine with me). Very strong and (almost) violent second half. A very nice way to close this good album.At the time I purchased this album, I far much preferred \"Song For America\" (probably their progiest effort) and was a some kind of disappointed with this one. At the time of this review (some thirty years later), the same impression applies. Although there is not a single weak track, true highlights are too scarce to make this one a masterpiece. Still, a very good and solid album. The remastered CD features two live versions of which \"Cheyenne Anthem\" sounds pretty good. Four stars."

          "text": "Taken as a whole, I find \"Leftoverture\" to be an excellent, if somewhat overrated album that strongly straddles the line between radio-friendly accessibility and the progressive dynamics in response to their more experimental peers at the time overseas. The song writing, and especially instrumental performances are first rate. Bass and guitar standout for me, with the keys becoming very cheesy and overwhelming as the songs pass by; Ehart's drumming didn't leave any impression on me (which is usually a bad sign). The obvious hit of \"Carry On My Wayward Son\" steals the show with a splendid combination of hard rock and complex composition, but successive tracks hit the mark more often than not. Low points are usually when the listener gets frustrated with the repetitive pitch of the vocals, but fortunately the band throws in enough instrumental highlights to out-do any serious damage caused by shrill singing.The end result is a unique sound which many will enjoy, even those whose first exposure to \"Carry On...\" was in the credit sequence of the movie \"Anchor Man\"; however, \"Leftoverture\" hardly deserves to be rated as high as some of the other pillars of progressive music-- there simply isn't as much going on here as in most of the other greats.Songwriting 3 Instrumental Performances 3 Lyrics/Vocals 3 Style/Emotion/Replay 3"

          "text": "An excellent classic rock album that morphs into a definite keeper prog record. I have to say that I don't find this to be the peak of Kansas' career--I would refer those interested to their first couple of albums. But although the highs aren't quite as high as in albums past, they are much more consistent and coherent here, and in my mind the music is diverse and creative enough to warrant inclusion to masterpiece, must-own status.Carry On Wayward Son, The Wall, What's On My Mind. Here are the classic rockers, one of which would become a radio anthem staple and included in hundreds of generic classic rock compilations. The other two are quite good as well, and the highlight for both is hearing Walsh at his absolute vocal pea, at least in my opinion. Catchy and fun, Wayward Son is the only one that's a bit progressive.Miracles Out of Nowhere. Let us commence with the prog! Slightly shifting time signatures, a great melody, a Gentle Giant-ish groove in the middle, and a killer upbeat finale: that's a great combination, which makes for a very memorable song. Just another case of Kansas not getting the respect they deserve.Opus Insert, Questions of My Childhood. Two shorter tracks as a warm-up for the closing songs. The former has a circus-like middle (a mild ELP influence?) section that doesn't quite work, and the latter is a simplistic, bouncy tune that's enjoyable every time. Not too much substance here, but I never feel especially compelled to skip them.Cheyenne Anthem. Native American history and ruins being an interest of mine, I am very happy that a band like Kansas is willing to give respectful attention to these issues. Moving and captivating, this is a good progressive tune, though not on par with Song for America.Magnum Opus. Too bad their true magnum opus (opi?) had already been laid down on earlier albums, but this is no slouch either. Original all the way through, Livgren saves the best for last with a creepy keyboard build to an explosive keyboard/guitar volley for the finale. Again, Kansas show they know how to end an album with energy and style!Great prog album, with some fine classic rock to boot. Just don't form your opinion of Kansas based solely on this album, because I think they have more to offer than we get here."

And I still think that Kansas best hour was when they released Point Of Known Return. But it\ufffds undeniable that Leftoverture is not very far behind. The band was maturing its own sound and the mix of heavy guitars, country harmonies and prog keyboards was very original at the time. Not too many people recognized that at the time, but I was glad this album was a big hit. It showed the world America had its prog scene as well. And one hell of a good band to prove it!The track list to me is still a mixed bag, but it\ufffds also made of fantastic tunes, even if the styles varies from song to song. The sequence is a bit uneven for my taste. Sometimes I feel like we are hearing different bands playing in the same CD. They worked much better this issue in Point Of Known Return. But... even if they sound different from track to track, they are all very good! Sometimes excellent. Carry On for exemple is more than just a hit. It is a classic that happens to be a hit. It broke new grounds and deserved all the credit it got, even if it was a bit overplayed.All in all an excellent prog album. One of Kansas two that I think is a must have in any prog collection. 4,5 stars. Highly recommended!."

          "text": "New Zealand in the 1970s had a rather limited range of music available. Certainly I don't remember KANSAS in the record shops, nor do I recall ever hearing their hits on the radio. Perhaps they were. Whatever the reason, I never heard KANSAS until this year.What I've heard has left me scratching my head. I know it's not my kind of music, but why? After all, many people whose opinions I respect adore this group.'Carry On Wayward Son' is purportedly the band's most famous offering. Certainly my son (not wayward), a Guitar Hero II fanatic, recognised it instantly when it began playing. He loves it. So why don't I? I ought to: it has a killer riff, a wonderful hook in the chorus and excellent guitar. Trouble is, with all these ingredients KERRY LIVGREN hasn't actually put together a song. The verses are black holes which absorb any tension and excitement created by the splendid opening. And the sound itself is an uncomfortable juxtaposition of heart-of-America country rock and progressive rock. There's funk, country, rock and even a guitar/keyboard battle of sorts, all jammed cheek-by-jowl into five minutes. Perhaps if I'd been brought up with this music I'd be much more comfortable with it.Sadly, this is the album's highlight. The best offering comes first, 'front-loading' the album: good for sales, but it makes it hard to keep the album on the turntable. Oddly, the opening track isn't really in the style of the rest of the album, which features as much keyboard and violin as guitar. What strikes me as I work my way patiently through this second-grade recording is how out of place it is. It's sort of a combination of TODD RUNDGREN and JETHRO TULL, odd as that sounds: dozens of naive little melodies tacked together in a whimsical fashion. Unfortunately, despite there being some nice bits, the result is not as satisfying as either RUNDGREN or TULL.Worse, there are some real stinkers here. 'Cheyenne Anthem' has not stood the test of time lyrically: such sentiments, expressed by good ol' white boys, really sound insincere. Such 'noble savage' themes have been done far better by others (songs by BRUCE COCKBURN, and PETER GABRIEL's 'San Jacinto', come to mind). Nor does the European TULL-lite classical sound suit the theme of the song. The girlie chorus at the two minute mark is so inappropriate I burst out laughing the first time I heard it, as I did at the classical piano at the five minute mark. What relevance do either of these musical vignettes have to the Cheyenne? The song doesn't work for me on any level. And the humbly titled 'Magnum Opus', with a title that takes a full two minutes to scroll across my car stereo, goes nowhere. It's interesting, but simply doesn't connect with me.I understand that this album is widely regarded as a classic, which is why I have given it a number of careful and patient listens. I've found enough promise here to be tempted to try a few more of their tunes - if only I hadn't been told that this is their best work. Forgive me, but I do not find this album sufficiently compelling to recommend to others."

Besides this one song every song on this fantastic album is a classic.The album starts with the hit Carry on wayward son ( for some reason songs like these could be hits in the seventies. It would never have happened today) that has all a Kansas song needs. Great vocal harmonies, a good hard rock riff and beautiful keyboards ( organ). Next song The Wall is a beautiful song with one of the most memorable vocal melodies ever in a Kansas song. The album ends with Magnum Opus which is just a beautiful epic song.

While the big hit and \"The Wall\" are both very good, \"What's on my mind\" and \"Miracles out of Nowhere are the true highlights, featuring a mixture of uplifting hard rock in that American style with melodic prog in the British tradition. The ending of \"Miracles\" is simply a crowning moment for American progressive rock. Unfortunately, side 2 is very weak, the band having largely run out of ideas, with mediocre songwriting rendering some fine playing largely ineffectual. The best of the mediocre lot is \"Cheyenne Anthem\", which nonetheless fails to transcend. So, 4.5 stars for side 1 and 2 for side 2. It's nice having all the good stuff in one place, with the leftovers in a pile that can be hopped over. If you want to get one Kansas album, this could be it."

          "text": "Wow! Never before have I heard such a wonderfull piece of Symphonic Prog that sounded so complete and together! Well, perhaps that's just my initial enjoyment running away with itself. Allow me to hopefully put this album in perspective:The following bands are the only symphonic bands I have listened to thus far: Yes, Genesis, Ajalon, Anglagard, Puppet Show, Echolyn and Kansas. Out of those bands, the only band's discography I have really explored is Yes. Out of that knowledge, the only other album that may match or surpass the greatness of LEFTOVERTURE would possibly be RELAYER by Yes, but other than that, this album really seems to stand on it's own level of greatness.This is the first Kansas album I have ever listened to, and I have no idea if the band's other subsiquent efforts are as good a quality as this opus, but I do feel that the band in general shows promise. They may never top Yes of course, simply because I still consider RELAYER and FRAGILE to be crowning achievements of Symph. Prog, however LEFTOVERTURE does indeed surpass the likes of HYBRIS and CLOSE TO THE EDGE in great strides. It is less pompous than it's counterparts, and for that reason, te overall listening experience ends up being much more enjoyable.Alas, as I can see, this album got the highest rating out of all the Kansas works, and I'm very weary of venturing any further, because the steady decline of album ratings from this point on promises sure dissapointment. But I will be brave and continue forward; in the meantime I will relish the experience of hearing this album for the first time and remember the amazing feeling I experienced when Magnum Opus came on and floored me. LEFOTVERTURE is one of those rare occasions in which the album itself exceeds even the bands' expectations, and often times the magic can never be retrieved or repeated; it's almost as if a part of the band's genious dies as the album is born, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Had these moments never occured, we wouldn't have great albums like RELAYER, THE WALL, LATERALUS, MISPLACED CHILDHOOD, IMAGES AND WORDS, etc. While each of those subsiquent bands never made a better album than the ones given in my opinion, I would rather the albums be made than not be made at all.And so it is with Kansas it seems and their album LEFTOVERTURE; however the jury is still out until I can lay ear on the abnd's other works, then if I still feel this way, it will solidify the five star rating I am giving LEFTOVERTURE. A true masterpiece if I ever heard one.Until next time, happy listening."

          "text": "It's a dazzling venture that Kansas embarked on in 1974 with their self-titled debut, in throwing out an album so influenced by the European prog acts in such a conservative cultural environment that is the American heartland. But not only that, but also in having the guts to make use of that cultural heritage and incorporate its warm, earthy qualities in the sound of the band.This leaves the band in a state of limbo, caught between two groups with extremely polarised tastes. It's no surprise then that many find Kansas to be a disappointment, and to be honest, that's an opinion I perfectly understand. But judging them on radio hits like Dust In The Wind and Carry On Wayward Son makes you no better than anyone complaining on ELP because of songs like Benny The Bouncer. Aforementioned hits are a part of the bands sound, yes, but they're not all there is to it, neither are they reasons to be concerned for those who love well-crafted, prog-tinged rock songs with stunning melodies and immediate catchiness.No one have a problem with Roundabout, as far as I know.Leftoverture differs from earlier releases in one important aspect. Where they were composed of distinct prog songs and poppier dittos side-by-side, Leftoverture is where Kansas masters their fusion and makes the different influences interwoven and intimate. They create a flow that's somewhat missing on say Masque or Song For America. It's a perfect blend of rocking, swirling symphonic, atmospheric and slightly quirky music that grabs the listener at heart from the start. As such, this is probably Kansas' most 'accessible' release alongside Point Of Know Return. Balanced in style, Leftoverture is also balanced in instruments. Keys of a multitude of colours, from atmospheric synths via crystal-clear piano to the familiar sounds of the Hammond organ never takes too much place, and their cerebral appeal is neatly counter-balanced by strong, often heavy (in a symphonic prog context) guitar, right along with rocking solos and quirky passages, all in the right places. But for me, Kansas greatest appeal has always been found in the bass playing of Dave Hope and Robbie Steinhardt's rich, romantic violin. Fans of vocal harmonies won't be disappointed either, as some of the best in the game can be found here.There is a little of everything to be found on Leftoverture. Magnum Opus is the song that should open even the most doubtful listener's eyes to the capacity of the band. It starts with a mystical theme, with a slightly eastern feel. Silent synthesiser carry the first theme behind summoning drums, until the song unfolds in a symphonic outburst from all the members. Back to what almost sounds like a menacing, effect-carried bass and delicate bells and a lighter mini-solo from the guitar, this is where it really begins. Classic Kansas, with the band backing a soft-singing Walsh, it's suddenly surprisingly ballad-like. The rest is just instrumental madness, covering as many mood-swings, tempos and different parts as Yes would need an extra fifteen minutes to put together. It is dense, in other words. Fast, dense and relentless, this is a song that sums up what symphonic rock is all about in just eight and a half minutes.The album would benefit from more compositions of this calibre, I can't deny it. Its greatness lies more in the talented fusion and sense of completion than on individual songs, some of the bombast, wall-of-sound approach and imagery found on epics such as The Pinnace, Song For America and Lamplight Symphony is therefore undoubtedly lost on Leftoverture. That's what makes me prefer Song For America.Still 4 stars. Without doubt.//LinusW"

          "text": "Lefotverture is the first of the two studio magnum opuses by Kansas - this album recaptures the powerful majesty of the Song for America album and capitalizes with the sort of energy that had been worked on in the less impressive Masque. The element of inspired writing appears on a top-notch stance (it is only a coincidence that Steve Walsh was undergoing a dry spell phase while Kerry Livgren was delivering his full potential); the fact that the writing will remain equally powerful in their next studio effort proves that the 76-78 era was the band's absolute pinnacle. The album kicks off on a catchy mood with 'Carry On Wayward Son', one of the most celebrated 70s rock anthems in teh history of USA's rock. Even though this track may sound similar in mood to the standards that were elaborated at the time by Boston, this particular track showcases a bigger dose of melodic cleverness and elaborated arrangements through the tightly ordained varying motifs - this extra complexity is controlled enough as not to kill the melodic basis' undisputed catchiness. 'The Wall' settles in next to expose yet another example of the symphonic essence that palyed such a big role in the evolution and golden age of Kansas: this beautiful progressive ballad displays a link to Procol Harum and Yes thanks to the emotional guitar leads and the elegant keyboard layers pertinetly augmented by Steinhardt's violin lines. This tale of mystical introspection is moving and majestic in pure Kansas-style, all the way toward its delicious anthemic finale. Track 3 is the least complex in the flock, although it bears an interesting set of chord progressions in the interlude as a resource of natural sophistication: the heavy GFR accent keeps it in a mainstream level. In contrast, 'Miracles Out of Nowhere' brings one of the most consciously prog-driven pages in Kansas' histtory - everything from the stylish intro to the solemn sung parts and from the GG-inspired interlude to the bombastic climax works as a unified whole of progressive grandeur. With less pomposity but similar prog depth comes 'Opus Insert', the track that opened up the vinyl edition's side 2: the bolero intermission (vibes included) and the spacey closure bear unhidden influences from teh chamber side of symphonic prog. 'Questions of My Childhood', dominantly penned by Walsh, brings an air of proggied country-rock: Walsh has written a number of tracks with this framework, and this one is arguably the most successful at it. A special mention goes to Steinhardt's violin deliveries, which create a perfect set of American Western colors to the mood demanded by the track. 'Cheyenne Anthem' brings back the majestic melancholy that had first appeared in 'Miracles Out of Nowhere' in combination with the solemnity of 'The Wall': the colorful interlude and the fluid succession of the sung portions state the perfect anticipation for the fantastic coda. At his point, the album has reached a captivating climax, but the top achievement of the album is incapsulated in its final 8+ minutes - this is where 'Magnum Opus' settles in to moe the listener's jaw down to the floor. The succession of motifs is set up beautifully: the psychedelic drive of the opening section, the ELP-meets-LZ high spirit of sections c and e, the eerie vibes that lead the way through section d and the fabulous spectrum delivered in the short yet effective coda bring some of the best North American prog rock ever. Even though this track's definitive version appears on the Two for the Show live set, this one works as the perfect ending for this prog masterpiece."

          "text": "The perfect prog rock springboard for the diehard hard rock fans. LEFTOVERTURE boasts the classic tune ''Carry On Wayward Son'', the song that most hard rock purists will say is their best overall track. I say Wayward Son isn't the best track on the album, although it is their best that's considered a ''hit''. I actually feel that ''What's On My Mind'' is just as powerful of a rock tune.Prog rock exists in the longer tracks, i.e. ''Miracles Out of Nowhere'', ''Cheyenne Anthem'' and ''Magnum Opus''. ''Magnum Opus'' lives up to its name on the album and was one of the first tunes I heard that utilized several themes in a short span, and Kansas is one of the few acts that can pull the tune off well. Easily the highlight for the beginning alone. The other two are so corny they're good, and the violin keeps everything from derailing.I have some sympathy for this album as it was one of the first (in a comparitive sense) prog albums I really fell in love with. Well played and not too demanding, but for some progsters might see this as too commercial. I say this is the last of the great Kansas albums as they became more of an AOR band after this with prog influence. Start your Kansas trek here, but make sure to get the debut and SONG FOR AMERICA along the way if you like Kansas's prog moments."

          "text": "Miracles out of KansasWhile the first three Kansas albums showed great promise and contained a lot of fantastic songs, these albums also included a few weaker moments. This is particularly true of the previous album, the uneven Masque. On that album, the band seemed not entirely sure yet of the direction they wanted to go in. On Leftoverture, by contrast, all of the pieces of the Kansas puzzle fell into place and they created with this album their first masterpiece.Carry On Wayward Son and The Wall are two of the most well-known Kansas songs and they are standards of the band's live repertoire and have featured on multiple compilations. Miracles Out Of Nowhere and Cheyenne Anthem are likewise true Kansas classics. The entirety of the album is simply superb!The next album, Point Of Know Return, is my personal Kansas favourite, but Leftoverture is an essential progressive Rock record. A must have!"

          "text": "This album means many memories to me, so beware of bias. Hell, that is irrelevant anyway, it's such a good album!Kansas's Leftoverture is criminally underrated in the world of prog, and especially ProgArchives. Why this band doesn't get mentioned more often is beyond my understanding, as they really were one of the great giants in the 70s along with Yes, Genesis, ELP, and the slightly lesser ones of Rush, Tull, and Gentle Giant.1. Carry On Wayward Son- Now this is one familiar tune. Easily my least favorite on the album, but that doesn't mean it really doesn't rock. The keyboard and guitar interplay is fantastic and often overlooked because the song is so well-known. A wonderfully well-composed anthem with more complexity than you'd be deceived to think. 9/102. The Wall- This song is incredibly majestic and is Livgren's actual favorite composition with Kansas. It's easy to see why. The guitar is glorious in this track, along with the beautifully written keyboards. The vocals, drums, bass are also fantastic. What a wonder! 10/103. What's On My Mind- This is more in the vein of Kansas's rockier roots, but that doesn't make it any less good than the rest of the songs. This song seems to have been heavily influential to Boston and other bands to come. The interplay here as well is keeping the same level of craftsmanship. 9/104. Miracles out of Nowhere- Simply beautiful. If you ever find yourself denying Kansas's pedestal among the other prog giants, think again and listen to this composition. The keyboard counterpoint is wonderful, the violin is incredibly expressive, and everything in this song is perfect. Flawless. 10+/105. Opus Insert- Why does this song always get overlooked? Has to be one of my favorite songs from any prog classic of the 1970s. This song has it all! Amazing vocal harmonies, shifting time signatures, catchy and synth-laden keyboard parts, and of course.. the wonderful Wizard of Oz-esque march part in the middle that is simply musically amazing. Flawless. 10+/106. Questions of My Childhood- Wow, great keyboard work here! And try not singing along to THOSE vocals! This is really catchy, extremely addicting, and very well-written. Livgren has outdone himself 3 times in a row. The questions of my childhood weave a web of mystery! This is a delightful song. 10/107. Cheyenne Anthem- And it just keeps getting better, if that is even possible! This song is not near as upbeat as the previous track, but it is possibly even more amazing and touching. The song is again perfectly composed; it flows absolutely without flaw. My favorite moments are the children's choir and the amazing keyboard parts in the middle of the track. Flawless. Life has only just begun... 10+/108. Magnum Opus- Arguably Kansas's most progressive track. The guitar here is AMAZING! The structure is heavily progressive and experimental (by Kansas's standards or by mainstream prog, particularly U.S., for that matter). You couldn't pick a better closing song. 10/10If you don't own this album, get it now. It is easily one of the too oft overlooked masterpieces of classic progressive rock."

          "text": "Leftoverture is considered by many to be Kansas's crowning achievement, and with good reason: All eight songs are fantastic examples of progressive rock, and even the two or three tracks that could be classified as \"pop-oriented\" (especially the overplayed \"Carry On Wayward Son\") are great pieces of music in their own rights. Many believe that Leftoverture is Kansas's best album; they may be right- Leftoverture has sold over five million records. Because the album is the band's most consistent, it deserves recognition as a progressive rock masterpiece, despite an occasional small flaw. Because Steve Walsh was not producing much, this was definitely Kerry Livgren's moment of glory.\"Carry On Wayward Son\" Opening with an a cappella rendition of the chorus, this song is a classic rock radio staple, and is largely responsible for the misconception that Kansas is a pop-rock band, despite the impressive catalogue of quality progressive rock work. Kerry Livgren introduced this song to the band just as they were finishing things up in the studio. The song is meant to serve as a sequel to \"The Pinnacle,\" and seen in that light, it becomes less of the pop-rock song it is alleged to be, but the second part of a fantastic Kansas epic. One of the final lines in \"The Pinnacle\" is \"Above the din I rose,\" while the first line of the first verse in \"Carry On Wayward Son\" is \"Once I rose above the noise and confusion.\" There is incredible guitar work and catchy hooks, as well as a fine organ solo, so it should be our good fortune that radios picked up on at least this. It's a great song, and Leftoverture would not be complete without it.\"The Wall\" The sudden guitar introduction is mind-blowing. The introspective lyrics refer to a man's struggle to overcome spiritual barriers in his life, a metaphoric wall keeping him from obtaining salvation, as it were. The words were written years before Kerry Livgren became a Christian, but they proved to be prophetic. It is an excellent, moving song.\"What's On My Mind\" Kicking off with a ripping guitar introduction, this song is a heavy pop-rock track with a catchy vocal melody. The guitar soloing in the middle is some of the best Kansas has offered. \"What's On My Mind\" is a respectable short track with plenty of tight guitar riffs and a bit of fun.\"Miracles Out of Nowhere\" Despite the title of the final song, \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\" is the magnum opus of this album. The whole album is worth owning if only for this widely overlooked masterpiece. From the opening plinks to that first cymbal crash, the listener is drawn into a mysterious and masterful blend of sound. The lyrics are some of the most imaginative and arcane Livgren has ever written, but effect feelings that are difficult to describe. The chorus is inspiring in many ways. The polyphonic middle section includes a smart and intriguing use of acoustic guitar, organ, violin, and other instruments; this alone validates Kansas's place among the symphonic rock masters. Steinhardt's voice in the bridge is haunting as it echoes over a sustained organ. The end of the song features a screaming and well-crafted guitar solo. The energy is high, even during the last several measures before the organ buildup that brings \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\" to a close. The subtle variations on the different versions (live and otherwise- see Always Never the Same) keep the song even fresher and more exciting. This is not to be missed; it is the song responsible for bringing me to progressive rock music.\"Opus Insert\" While the name of this track eludes me, it's a very good short piece, again displaying Livgren's present spiritual state and prophesying (to a degree) where he would be. The introduction is wonderful, and the verse sections are pure-Kansas. Like much of Kansas's catalogue, it's an oft-overlooked splendid song.\"Questions of My Childhood\" Although there are no really weak tracks on Leftoverture, \"Questions of My Childhood\" is the weakest song compared to the other seven. It's certainly a catchy tune, but it's a little too whimsical. However, the two-line turn at the end of each verse and the violin work saves this one from being one that is often skipped.\"Cheyenne Anthem\" Here is a mournful acoustic guitar-laden piece that is the spiritual (and more progressive) father of \"Dust in the Wind.\" It describes the plight of Native Americans being driven from their land despite any peaceful motivations. While Robby Steinhardt's vocals here are woeful and somber, Steve Walsh's singing is pleadingly chilling. Speaking of Steve Walsh, he has complained that the instrumental section sounds like the theme song to The Simpsons, and one can see his point; that part initially doesn't seem like a bad observation. The Lydian mode used in the middle part is similar to that used in the opening of the long-running sitcom. After a few listens, however, the majesty of the piece overwhelms any semblance to the theme music of Matt Groening's best work. After a while, it returns again to Steinhardt's sober vocals; strangely, the music ends on a hopeful reprise of the introduction. Regardless, \"Cheyenne Anthem\" is one of the best songs on this album.\"Magnum Opus\" With the exception of the pithy \"The Spider,\" \"Magnum Opus\" is the closest thing Kansas ever came to an instrumental. Originally, the title of the album and the title of this track were reversed; \"Magnum Opus\" is literally the leftovers of the recording and songwriting processes, fused together to create a nasty piece of music full of spiraling time signature changes and dark, menacing chords. On the one hand, it's similar to previous lengthy songs because of it's tight structure (even if the composition doesn't always flow as neatly as one would expect). On the other hand, the frantic pace of those minor and diminished chords, the haunting organ passages, the screeching violin, and those heavy electric guitars make this unlike anything Kansas has ever done."

          "text": "Unexplainably overratedLeftoverture is Kansas fourth album and it is viewed by many, alongside with Point of No Return, as the band's Magnum Opus, but after owning this album (and Point of no Return also, if that matters) for a bit more then a couple of years i still can't see how people say that they are THE BEST Kansas albums, let alone masterpieces of progressive rock.Don't get me wrong here, I really like Leftoverture as a whole and think that it is an awesome album. The thing is, i don not think it is good enough for the masterpiece grade, i do not think it is Kansas's best material and i do not think that all the songs of the album are. . . well . . . masterpieces! That is because when it comes tonormalalbums, albums that are not concept albums and, therefore, should not be necessarily considered as a whole, i usually think about them in the song-by-song scheme and i give my grade considering each song's grade or quality. So, since i don't think all songs here are perfect, its not a masterpiece and, due to that, i think that this album is considerably overrated.About the songs, musicianship and other features, there are somethings i would like to state:Though Leftoverture is not Kansas's first step towardspopmusic, because since their debut they have simpler songs in their albums, it is with this very album that Kansas take a decisive step towards AOR and other radio-friendly genres alike, as we can notice wile listening the album's opening song, Carry On my Wayward Son, and its third song, What's on my Mind. That, however, does not means that the album is somehow worse just because they decided to reach for an wider audience, it just means that their AOR phase have its roots here.As i said before, i do not think that all songs here are perfect. Though most of the album is very good, some songs, like What's on my Mind and Questions of my Childhood are just, somehow, silly and quite sub-par to the rest of the album's songs. Also, the song The Wall sounds way too much like a rocked up Genesis song to me.Leftoverture also marks the beginning of Kansas's wall of sound, that consists of the violin, the guitars and the piano / synths / keyboards playing in unison.The highlights go to: Carry On my Wayward Son, The Wall, Opus Insert, Cheyenne Anthem and Magnum Opus.Grade and Final ThoughtsOK, so, when it comes to music, the best selling albums are the best, right? WRONG! Although it is understandable why this album have such a good grade (it is Kansas best selling album so far, after all), i can't see why so many people see this as their best. It isjusta very good album, that's all. So, 4 stars to Steve Walsh and friends."

I think that, behind CTTE, this is the best symphonic prog album ever created, and to boot, I like Kansas more than Yes. With all that being said, I think that this album is sorely underrated on this site. It's on par with some of the other classic prog albums of the 70s. I think that if Kansas hadn't gotten started as late as '74, that this wouldn't be the case, and they wouldn't be a gem that was gently shoved to the side to make more room for Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, etc. I also think that, being from America, they weren't originally associated with the prog movement, something that started off inherently British.This truly is one of my favorite prog albums, and it really speaks to me in a way that a true masterpiece would. At times, it feels like much more than that. This is one of the first prog albums that I ever heard, and one of the albums that helped me come to like this genre of music. It has all the traditional symphonic elements of prog at their best, and packs the hard rock punch that makes this music so endearing, so emotional, and (almost) so spiritual. I could go on and on and then on some more about every aspect of how this album claims a right as being considered one of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time, but I won't. My favorite tracks on here would have to be What's on My Mind, Miracles Out of Nowhere (my favorite Kansas song), Cheyenne Anthem, and Magnum Opus. If you don't already have this masterpiece that rivals the classic albums put out by the British and other Europeans prog giants, this should be a high priority for your ears. As far as I'm concerned, this album has no weaknesses, and I fail to see why some people think this is overrated. This is 5 stars, and a highlight of 70s progressive rock."

          "text": "Soaring ever higher.Kansas' best known album is definitely known for a reason. Often considered the peak of their career as the leading American Progressive band this is an album to buy and cherish, for sure. While it doesn't quite reach the levels of some of the other progressive acts that were coming out at the time (even if it was released at a time of musical turmoil for most bands), it does have a certain feel to it that just makes it so enjoyable to listen to. It's a warm, embracing album that is highly uplifting, symphonic and still approachable at the same time.Both sides of the album are incredibly strong, and worth listening to repeatedly. Most people likely know the album from the single to be released from it and likely the 'biggest' song ever to be released by Kansas. Clocking in at just under 6-minutes, the band opens up the fray withCarry On Wayward Son, a song that is, by itself, highly influential, catchy, memorable and hard to wear out. Also on the first side is the incredibly noteworthyThe Wall, another one of those tunes that sounds simply larger than life and highly motivational thanks to the keyboards and emotional guitar playing led by some very noteworthy lyrics. Ending off the first side is yet another standout for the album, the heavy and chargingMiracles Out Of Nowherewith its memorable reprise.The second side is likely the one to get the most attention from prog fans, being that it has some of the band's lengthiest and best known (from a prog standpoint) tunes on it.Magnum Opusis likely the one that most people will be looking forward to, and it actually bookends the side thank to the impressiveOpus Insertthat starts the side off with a bang.Magnum Opusitself isn't the band's lengthiest tune to date, but it is a good one, and at 8-minutes in length, most of which being instrumental madness, it's very much one to look forward to. Also on the second side is the ever impressiveCheyenne Anthem, likely the darkest song on the album, but still an excellent song to rock out to while maintaining all the complexities of a more 'traditional' prog arrangement.Being that this is an album with many near religious followers it's hard to add anything to it than that. But when all's said and done it's an excellent release that makes a great addition to any progressive library. 4.5 stars! A hard one to give the full mark to (for, honestly, inexplicable reasons), but definitely a deserving album, and a classic one at that. Highly recommended - and essential for Kansas fans (though they already knew that)."

I listened to it for a while, but I never really got my head around its cheesy and poppy sound. Make no mistake, this is obviously a symphonic progressive record by a very professional group of musicians and composers, but they just hear their music differently than I do. Among their influences I hear Yes (complex vocal arrangements), Gentle Giant (lot of that multi-noodling going about here) and perhaps some prog-glam of Styx and Journey. The band offers a strong classic rock (and prog) opening song 'Carry On My Wayward Son'. The album is quite consistent quality-wise and the production is also very good for the sound that is has. I just don't like it very much, because it rids the progressive rock from all its mystique, individuality and obscurity. Even when listening to the Flower Kings I'm happy to have the obvious Kansas-moments give way to the next thing."

Being powerful (like Power Neo Prog) and also calm when necessary at will, that's hard thing to accomplish, but of course, Kansas manages to do it. As R.W.Brown once said, they're really good. And I regret that I haven't managed to know them sooner (year ago perhaps?). And each song has something to offer. Even on later tracks (after second), melody isn't as strong as it was, it does not matter so much, right ? We have better things to hear, for example interesting ideas of circus like (few seconds, but it's here) tunes onOpus Insertand tricky transitions in the same song, including synth interludes.

Composed and recorded under intense record company pressure, and a severe case of writer's block for Steve Walsh, Kerry Livgren came through big time, with an album full of stunning music and lyrics.Unlike all other Kansas albums up to this point,Leftoverturecontains no straightforward rockers, or mundane soft ballads (the closest they come to the latter isThe Wall, which begins softly, but works it's way up to a prog power ballad). This is symphonic prog bliss from start to finish.And what a start. The album opens with the famousCarry On Wayward Son. Powerful and catchy, this is also the proggiest song to climb that high on the charts since Yes'Roundabout. The album is extremely well produced throughout, and peak with the aptly titledMagnum Opus, one of, if not the best song in Kansas' catalog.I won't take points off for the bonus tracks, live recordings ofCarry OnandCheyenne Anthem, but they are totally unnecessary, and superfluous to this amazing album."

          "text": "Interesting album, especially for chemists, as it delivers convincing proof that Rock can be melted down to liquid cheese.Back in the days, I had Genesis for breakfast, Crimson for dinner, Yes and ELP as inbetween snacks and Pink Floyd during sex. That period came to an end when I started to seek out second and third tier Symphonic Prog bands. Some of the music I found there was so bland that I gave up on Prog altogether for many years. At the absolute bottom of progressive meekness I stumbled over the middle-of-the-road pop rock of Kansas'Leftoverturealbum, their knee-fall to AOR.The album sure has got a couple of points working for it. Generally the music is pleasant.Carry On Wayward Soneven has a cool riff, andMagnum Opus, while not as 'big' and 'opus-y' as it pretends, at least reminds us of the talent this band once had. But generally the poppy balladry and the cringe-worthy vocals take away any enjoyment I could possibly get from this album. Everything sounds so tame, commercial and old-fashioned. It's not just cheesy, it has even turned stale. This is rock that has been watered down completely; it has no edge, no energy, no dare, no passion, no attitude.This is a professional product in its style, but for me this style of music is the exact reason why I seek refuge in Progressive Rock and other daring forms of musical creativity. Really, I'd rather listen to the Bee Gees; at least they are fun, and don't pretend to be anything more then mass product.Yes, I counted the 5 stars here, so I will meekly succumb to your collective condemnation. If it offers any consolation, I think the debut is really strong."

          "text": "Rock Progressivo AmericanoHere it is, the classic Prog album by the popular American rock band, Kansas. While highly regarded, there's still a lot of debate whether if this is actually Prog Rock or not. I tend to consider this as a lighter Symphonic Prog in the vein of Triumvirat, but Prog nonetheless, influenced by Genesis, a bit of Gentle Giant and some AOR band. What's the result? Well, it's a clever and catchy Symphonic Prog with equal number of complex passages as straight-forward rock ones.Not sure if this thought shows part of my craziness or not, but Leftoverture reminds me of Premiata Forneria Marconi's Per Un Amico; an album that strongly resembles the grandiose British Prog bands, yet there's not an actual rip-off and the musicians are actually able to compose and play equally(or better) as those from Britian. However, there is a flaw, but not in the music itself if not in my mind/ears: having listened to the U.K. bands way before these other Symphonic Prog groups, I can't help but think of 'x' British band when listening to the music of both, Per un Amico and Leftoverture. Also, there's this coincidence that both, Kansas and PFM, play Symphonic Prog including a violin player, not something common for the British Symphonic bands from the time, but that's not something that harms the music quite the opposite, it adds more diversity. Anyway, besides that similarity between PFM and Kansas, the music of both is pretty different, notable difference being that PFM sounds closer to something by an Eclectic Prog band with classical influences.Mind you, I won't let that harm the rating of this review, though my personal discomfort when listening to Kansas can't be denied. To that I can add my dislike for Steve's vocals, he's too American (cheesy) for my taste, though his voice is undoubtedly a unique ingredient in Kansas' music. Fortunately, the quality of the compositions that is present in Leftoverture makes me able to enjoy the band quite a bit in spite of the vocals, unlike with Song for America which I found the songs pretty average though with certain inner potential.Now, let me bring back again Triumvirat to the review since you probably were thinking what the hell does the German \"ELP clones\" have to do with Kansas. While Kansas definitely don't show Emerson, Lake & Palmer as an influence, Kansas does have Kerry Livgren and Steve Walsh playing very similar kind of keyboards as those which J\ufffdrgen Fritz played. These keyboards sound 'thinner', less exciting, not a phenomenon like those marvelous Moog's or alike the Mellotron or like the classic B3 Hammond-Organ utilized by the British; surely the reason why the overall sound of these bands is not as powerful as that from Yes, Genesis or ELP. Anyhow, that's not necessarily a negative critic, just an aspect that I hear from Kansas that clearly differentiates them from the classic Prog bands.So, which are the highlights from Leftoverture? All 8 songs are equally strong, in my opinion, different of course, some are straight-forward rock like 'Carry On My Wayward Son' and 'What's On Your Mind', but those still are inventive and as memorable as the more elaborated pieces such as 'Miracles Out of Nowhere', 'Cheyenne Anthem' and 'Magnum Opus'. The entire album features Kansas in their peak, instrumentally and composition-wise, the guitars rock hard, the violin adds that new dimension, the keyboards are fine despite their 'thin' sound and the rhythm section does a good job.Leftoverture is undeniably a Symphonic Prog album recommended for all the fans of that genre, but I don't think it's a masterpiece of the genre since it's not something entirely unique neither mind- blowing nor a spine-chilling experience, but still worthwhile. However, I recommend you to buy the classic Symphonic Prog albums released prior to Leftoverture first, like Fragile, Trilogy, Foxtrot, et al. If you're going to get one 'Prog' Kansas album, get this, that's for sure."

Sure, we find some keyboards, some nice passages very Symphonic Prog like, but it sounds a bit more classic rock to me. Despite this, \"Leftoverture\" is a great album, definitely an enjoyable experience all the way through.The style, like I said, sounds more like classic rock to me, especially in the opener, the famous \"Carry On Wayward Son\". There are some interesting prog like passages, noticeable in the final track \"Magnum Opus\" and \"Cheyenne Anthem\", thanks to the keyboard virtuosity and the guitar passages. There are some great vocals, as well as some nice and pondering bass lines, great riffs, and nice arrangements. Another appreciating element of this album is the structure, very solid and with some wonderfully alternated moods.If you ask me, the key songs would be the excellent and famous \"Carry On Wayward Son\", the interesting alternation between experimental arrangements and catchy melodies in \"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\", the great and fascinating moods of \"Cheyenne Anthem\", and, of course, the gem of the album, the epic 8 minutes of \"Magnum Opus\", with it's mind blowing alternations of different moods, all of them fantastic and enjoyable. Another interesting piece is \"Questions Of My Childhood\", a brief but effective song that always fascinates me.To sum up, a great album, like I said, and definitely a great addiction to any music collection. But I'm still not so sure they're 100% prog."

          "text": "At the time I got to know Kansas it was mostly a classic rockband to me. I knew Dust in the Wind, Carry on Wayward Son and Point of know Return (last one just slightly) and that's what the band was to me for a long time. In 2004 I got to know Magnum Opus and had to change my mind of course. When I saw them on a Dutch pop/prog festival a year later and they played some more proggy stuff I got even more convinced. Kansas is probably 75% prog and 25% pop/rock or something like that. Leftoverture is the highlight of their career so let's take a look at the whole album.Kansas' most famous album starts with one of their most famous songs ever Carry On Wayward Son and that's a wise choice because it gets you in the right groove for the album. The interesting thing about the song is that it's a blend of pop and prog. It's catchy but still more original than most popsongs and therefore slightly proggy. 3,5*The Wall is a very nice song, the first with prominent violin. Sort of a ballad though not really soft. 3,5*.What's on my Mind is the shortest track on the album, and also the most rocking probably. Less poppy than the famous opener even though it's a close call. Good song, 3,25*.Miracles out of Nowhere is an accessible and quite vocally dominated track with slight folky undertones, especially in the first part. Halfway an instrumental part with keys and violin. This can easily be called the better part of the song. Nice but not too special. 3,5*.Opus Insert is in the same league as previous, nice and accessible but not truly outstanding. 3,5*Questions of my Childhood is too short to be a classic, in fact I'm surprised there's so much in it for a 3,5 minute song. Violin and vocals do the job here once again. 3,25*.Cheyenne Anthem is suddenly of an entirely different league. What a great variegated track this is. Starting beautiful with great vocals and piano, some wonderful tones around 2:30 followed by a great instrumental part with all sorts of instruments amongst which of course Kansas' trademark, the violin. Ultimately the song ends more or less like it began, only this time as a true grand finale. Simply stunning. 4,5*.And yet there's one better track, be it just slightly: the fantastic show stopper Magnum Opus. The song really is what the title already suggests and is probably the best song the band ever made. Terrific composition, finally proving exactly how progressive Kansas really can be. For those who see them as both pop/rock and prog: this one is certainly on the right end of the spectrum (as far as I'm concerned). 4,75*.So the sting is in the tail with this album. After the first six tracks you might think we're dealing with a sophisticated rock album but last two tracks make it a different ball game. This is prog for sure even though not the best example you will ever hear. On average some 3,6 after doing the maths but I will round up because I feel 3 stars is selling this one short. No poor tracks and a few great ones to finish with is good enough for the description (near) excellent addition to a prog collection. Looking at the rating scores so far not everyone is equally convinced which makes the album somewhat controversial. But if you want to know what American prog sounds like I surely could recommend this classic !"

          "text": "I vividly recall thatLeftoverturewas my first encounter with Kansas and it's undoubtedly the best possible introduction one can get!Every single track on this recording has some great quality, even ifCarry On Wayward Sonseems to be the one that gets most recognition. This well known album-opener is definitely worthy of distinction for being both a great commercial tune while still maintaining a great artistic quality to it. Still, it's theThe Wallthat has always been my definite favorite composition out of the bunch. This track could have easily worked even if it was expanded to double of its current size. This was not really possible due to the length limitations of the vinyl record, but may I be the first to suggest trimming downMagnum Opusto half its length in order to give more space to this wonderful composition? A daring statement, to say the least, but I never really cared for that track's overlong build-up.There are really no weak tracks here, which is a great surprise considering the way Kansas' previous albums turned out. Even the debut album had an unnecessary piece likeBringing It Back! This is really not a problem onLeftovertureas we are treated not only to the band's most accomplished material but also to their most progressive such as well. Even upbeat tunes likeOpus Insert, that would have been played straight on other records, but are played with an excellent spin on the instrumental arrangements. In this particular case, Phil Ehart definitely steals the show with his drum work.There is really no reason for me to push this review any further since this album is already this band's most recognized release and I'm sure that you'll find all the additional information in other reviews. For me this is easily one of the best examples of great music by Kansas and an excellent addition to any prog rock music collection!***** star songs: Carry On Wayward Son (5:13) The Wall (4:47) Opus Insert (4:26)**** star songs: What's On My Mind (3:27) Miracles Out Of Nowhere (6:29) Questions Of My Childhood (3:38) Cheyenne Anthem (6:50) Magnum Opus (8:27)"

          "text": "1976. The time of grandiose, symphonic prog, when what the media described as overblown was king. Yes had released Going For The One, Genesis Wind & Wuthering, and bands such as Supertramp were craftily mixing the symphonic with commercial sensibilities.So, what does an American band do to keep up? Why, release quite the most fantastic mix of what would come to be called AOR pomp rock with clear symphonic prog tendencies.The most famous song they did is, of course, Carry On My Wayward Son, and it opens proceedings here. It is a glorious piece of pomp rock, and is deservedly on virtually every American classic rock compilation you can buy each and every Christmas.What follows is American rock at its finest. There is an interesting, and very good, mixture of what we would call traditional symphonic prog, with magnificent moog and organ, with classic hard rock, a la Deep Purple in their prime at times, with a softer, accessible, American rock feel. The violins also bring into play a folk aspect to this album which is very welcome.The music and lyrics are intelligent throughout, and, as far as the latter are concerned, none more so than on Cheyenne Anthem, the subject of which is rather obvious from the title. Thoughtful, sympathetic, and brought to bear by some marvellous musicianship, quiet throughout before building up to a grand finale. The violin solo is simply excellent, as are the complex keyboards which interplay with it. I think this is a haunting piece of music, and the best on the album.This is a fine album of American progressive rock, and is highly recommended.Four stars, and strong at that."

          "text": "Despite the background and intentions of these talented musicians, I never felt much attraction to their music. It seems too sterile and rock-oriented to me. I never even thought to include this band in the same group with the \"art rockers\" that later became known as \"progressive rock\" artists. For me, KANSAS was a group of pop rockers akin to STYX, BOSTON, JOURNEY, and QUEEN (none of whom I would call progressive rock groups). While there may be progressive elements to some of the songs or even an album or two of these artists, they are not in my opinion true progressive rock artists. \"Second tier\" prog rock I call them. Or \"prog wannabes.\" The only song I can and could ever tolerate from Leftoverture is the hit, \"Carry On My Wayward Son.\" Nothing else that Kansas ever did has connected with me--even now, years later, blessed as I am now with a greater appreciation for composition and musicianship."

          "text": "Leftoverture is often considered to be Kansas' masterpiece, and it is definitely their most progressive without a doubt. First of all, everyone probably is familiar with the iconic \"Carry On My Wayward Son\". It's a very strong radio rock song with above par writing for the part, featuring time and mood changes. Beyond that, there following few songs follow roughly the same format and it all is quite accessible, still maintaining a strong progressive American feel throughout. \"Magnum Opus\" is usually the favorite track by most progressive rock fans, and is the most progressive on the album. It's very rock heavy with very dark atmospheric keys engulfing the inception of the track that leads into a short bass dominated section, which in turn leads into a guitar solo that turns soothing guitar lines into the backing for Steve Walsh's fine voice. Following that are various impressively executed instrumental passages, all with different feels.Like Kansas' other albums, anyone who like radio oriented country rock with a progressive tinge would enjoy this, but this album is also probably the most suitable to Yes and Genesis fans available in the Kansas catalog."

          "text": "In my humble opinion this is one of the greatest progressive rock albums ever recorded. With this album Kansas finally hit their peak of self-actualization: their albums before were very good but often unbalanced or lacking cohesion, and their albums after were very good but definitely took on a more commercial sound. With Leftoverture, however, they find their sound at its most perfected. Amazing melodies and catchy hooks intersect with progressive rock to create songs that are just as easy to appreciate for their instrumental mastery as they are to sing along to.\"Carry On Wayward Son\" should need no introduction. True, this song is tremendously overplayed, and listening to the band play it live these days is kind of depressing since it's fairly obvious they're completely sick of it after having to play it at every show for 30 years straight. That said, it's still a fantastic song. The hooks are fantastic, the solos are astounding, and the vocals are breathtaking. I'm not going to talk too much about this song because I'm assuming most everyone has heard it at least once, but if you haven't, rest assured that it lives up to the hype it gets. It's great.\"The Wall\" follows up the famous opener in a more introspective vein. Though it's perhaps a less anthemic song than \"Carry On,\" it's no less energetic or powerful, with spectacular guitar work and a flawless Steve Walsh vocal performance on an album full of flawless Steve Walsh performances. With lyrics about overcoming personal demons and wailing, emotional guitar parts to match, \"The Wall\" is a powerful song that's also incredibly strong melodically. Steve Walsh's soaring vocals at the end of the song never fail to send shivers down my spine.\"What's On My Mind\" is another very interesting song, beginning again with some excellent guitar work. When the vocals come in, however, the song takes on more of an AOR sound before switching into the hard rock chorus. It's a bit of a bizarre combination that works surprisingly well; a testament to Kerry Livgren's compositional prowess. I would have to say that it's probably the weakest song on the album; however, when a song this good is the weakest on the album you know you've got something special.\"Miracles Out of Nowhere\" is, in my opinion, one of if not the best songs Kansas ever wrote. The music blends together keyboards, guitar, and violin more seamlessly than perhaps any other Kansas song, and every melody, every word, every note work perfectly together to create a song that's undeniably prog-rock but can nonetheless get stuck in your head if you're not careful. Robby Steinhardt and Steve Walsh trade off vocals to great effect and the final product is truly something magical (or perhaps miraculous?)\"Opus Insert\" is a song that doesn't get talked about too much, and for the life of me I can't figure out why not. The track begins with some mysterious sounding synth sounds before vocals enter, backed by a bombastic instrumental part. The chorus is equally great, and when Steve Walsh belts it out the final time you realize that you're listening to one heck of a vocalist. \"Opus Insert\" may not be the rock anthem that \"Carry On Wayward Son\" is, but it's still a great song and one that I think would sound great live; pity it seemed to be so rarely played.\"Questions of My Childhood\" is one of the few songs on the album to have Steve Walsh co- listed as a writer, but despite his reputation on some of the later Kansas albums of writing more \"commercial\" songs, this one fits in perfectly on the album. Heavily featuring keyboards, \"Questions of My Childhood\" is probably the most cheerful song on the album, or at least the most optimistic. I also think it's lyrically one of the strongest on the album, and of course Walsh delivers a stellar vocal performance.\"Cheyenne Anthem\" is another criminally under-talked-about Kansas song, with rather tragic lyrics told from the perspective of the Native Americans and expansive, orchestral music to match. Obviously this is another very emotional song, and again Steinhardt and Walsh switch off on lead vocals to great effect. The pacing of the song is brilliant as well, starting off subdued, building intensity, dropping back down and finally exploding in a burst of orchestral grandeur as the song ends.\"Magnum Opus\" finishes off the album. If I'm not mistaken this is the only song that is credited to all five members of Kansas, with the story being that they each wrote a section and then put it all together. If that's actually the case then I'm quite impressed, as the song flows very well. The track is mostly instrumental (there's one brief section with vocals), and features all of the band members demonstrating their incredible command of their instruments, as well as the tightness of the band as a whole. A great finish to a great album.If you've never heard Kansas before then Leftoverture is absolutely the place to start. This is one of those albums where every song is fantastic; there is zero filler and no poor songs. Thinking about it, I've probably listened to this album more times than almost any other, and I can still listen through the whole thing without skipping any songs or getting bored.In my eyes at least, this is a masterpiece.5/5"

          "text": "Kansas's \"Leftoverture\" is literally a magnum opus of songs linked to a thematic concept.'Point of Know Return' and 'Leftoverture' are both real progressive conceptual works and as good as Kansas gets. On \"Leftoverture\" the band consist of Kerry Livgren on guitar, keyboards, Robby Steinhardt on lead vocals, violin, viola, Steve Walsh on lead vocals, keyboards, vibes, Dave Hope on bass, Phil Ehart on drums, and Rich Williams on acoustic and electric guitars. This lineup is one of the most celebrated in Kansas' long tenure. The music on the album is virtuoso and features some of the best known Kansas compositions with incredibly inventive structures and adventurous time sigs, wrapped up in a concept.The album cover is striking and one that I treasure in my vinyl collection. The image of an old sage with a scroll pondering over his work is perhaps as striking as Gryphons \"Red Queen to Bishop Three\" cover. The medieval concept of a Nostradamus like figure or Leaonardo Da Vinci is a perfect conceptual image for Kansas to indulge in.'Carry on Wayward Son' begins proceeding with a bonafide classic and featured on many rock compilations as well as every Kansas compilation and live show. It is the quintessential Kansas with killer riffs and fantastic melodies building to an unforgettable chorus. The music is wonderful, especially the half time feel with heavy guitars. The band harmonise well and and this is the best Kansas song without a doubt, making them milions deservedly.'The Wall' has a nice steady beat but sounds very AOR to me and I am not a fan. Kansas will return to a stronger AOR sound in years to follow. 'What's on my mind' has a good guitar intro and then soft rock verses building to heavier guitar on chorus. Not prog but a nice melody.'Miracles out of nowhere' has a chiming vibraphone intro and very nice Hammond layered with an odd time sig and then acoustic and gentle vocals. Love the feel of this and much more proggy than last 2 songs. The half time section is medieval and has an odd 7/8 meter with very progressive keyboard instrumentation. The sig changes again to an unusual meter, as violins begin and a wall of sound opens up. A new time shift as the tempo quickens and a scorching lead break is heard makes this one of the definitive higlights. An underrated classic for Kansas.Side two of the vinyl is definitely the proggiest Kansas with a huge suite of songs to create an opus and indeed the first part is titled 'Opus insert'. The lyrics are performed strongly by Steinhardt; \"There's a reason for all that rhymes, it's the fact and the way of the times, It's moving emotion, it's high and it's low, no matter where you go, There is something for all who look, there's a story in every book, All of the pages, between all the lines, so much that you can find, But there's too many empty lives my friend\". The music changes meter throughout and has some majestic keys and a very bombastic style. It is followed by 'Questions of my childhood'.This is a shorter song with similar time shifts and inspring lyrics; \"When the sun is in the mid sky, he wears a golden crown, And he soaks the world with sunshine as he makes another round, It's been a faster year than yesterday, all the things that I had planned, And when I think I might be gaining, I'm in the sunshine once again.\" The sound is uplifting with washes of melodic keys, and a strong beat that gets faster during the keyboard solo that fades.'Cheyenne anthem' is a ballad about the sadness of the cruel treatment against the Cheyenne Indians, and features beautiful instrumentation, keys, violins, medieval guitar, and loud percussion. It builds in speed in the middle as a frenetic keyboard solo comes in and vibraphone. The Gentle Giant sigs are odd and the thumping rhythm in the medial section is almost like a circus polka theme, but it is a cynical melody in contrast to the content. It has powerful lyrics about the death of the Cheyenne people robbed of their land and finishes with; \"Soon these days shall pass away, For our freedom we must pay, All our words and deeds are carried on the wind, In the ground our bodies lay, here we lay\". The poignant content is matched by sombre melodies and a melancholy children's choir. It finishes with one last majestic soundscape.'Magnum opus' is the longest track at 8 \ufffd minutes. It begins with pounding drums of war, and then Livgren's howling keyboards and a steady rhythm. The track takes off into a lengthy instrumental section with inventive sigs, musicians taking turns to shine on guitar, keyboards and all brought together by the rhythm machine of bass and drums sounding like Focus or ELP. There is an ominous melody and it all sounds so massive with a wall of sound that keeps up a compelling melody with vibes, marimba and violins. It slows into the main theme towards the end, swathes of keys, soaring guitars and a finale that ends suddenly on a high note. Incredible masterpiece of prog and typifies Kansas at their very best.In conclusion this is definitely one of the best Kansas albums and features their most beloved tracks. The exceptional single 'Carry on Wayward Son', the quasi-mystical 'Miracles out of nowhere' and all of side two make this an essential album and one of the best in 1976."

          "text": "When this group appeared on the scene in 1974 they were a conundrum. Even today the words Kansas and progressive rock go together about as well as politicians and honesty. Yet the fact remains that the finest prog band the United States has ever produced didn't hail from the east, west or third coast but sprouted up in the very heart of the country where attention from the established record companies was hardest to attract. Say what you will about hammy Don Kirshner but it was he who boldly took a chance on promoting a homegrown group that played challenging, complex material when most of the industry moguls were busy trying to discover the next Three Dog Night or Doobie Brothers. Kirshner stuck with them while they built their audience via constant touring and three decent LPs over a two year period when I'm sure all his peers were chuckling at his folly. But in October of '76 Kansas released 'Leftoverture' and the snickering stopped immediately. This album was a stunner from top to bottom. Turned out that stateside prog rock could crossover into the mainstream without compromising an iota of its integrity when presented with aplomb, superb fidelity and undeniable class. Streaking past the records of pandering pop stars to barge into the top five on the album charts, the disc demolished many long-held notions about public taste. The average Joe enjoyed this stuff just as much as the proggers did. The snobby critics and nearsighted naysayers were humbled at last because the local underdogs had pulled the upset, triumphed and revealed them to be badly mistaken bozos.Opening with the striking 'Carry On Wayward Son' was a stroke of genius. The strong, layered three-part harmonies catapulting the song's magnetic hook line hit like a tsunami wave and the song then incessantly floods your senses with great performances. I'll go so far as to pronounce it one of the best, most concise American-made specimens of prog rock ever. It has every ingredient for being recognized as such and is so infectious that it had no difficulty whatsoever in appealing to a broad strata of the populace who pushed the single up to #11. Everything about the track is top notch but you gotta admit that keyboardist Steve Walsh's vocal is still breathtaking in its powerful delivery. To this day very few singers can reach and sustain that final note like he does. 'The Wall' follows with an elegant instrumental intro preceding a beautiful, dramatic symphonic prog tune that includes wonderfully intricate intervals that substantially heighten the overall effect of the number. Guitarist and principal writer Kerry Livgren's lyrics are surprisingly profound for that era. 'And though it's always been with me/I must tear down the wall and let it be/All I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony/Shining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross/There is no loss,' Walsh sings with touching conviction. It's an emotionally-charged song that gets me every time I hear it. 'What's On Your Mind' is next and it shows that these boys could rock hard without reverting to beat-you-over-the-head tactics. Their instinctive understanding and respect for dynamic tension keeps the tune from becoming pedestrian. Kudos are also in order for the tight, inventive ending.On 'Miracles Out of Nowhere' their collective imagination and willingness to take an adventurous, progressive approach in their craftsmanship works to the song's advantage in that they allow it to evolve into something both accessible and engaging. It also demonstrates that they were a dedicated group of musicians who had a clear objective in mind about what kind of music they wanted to make. Many of us truth seekers could readily relate to the thought-provoking words of 'Here I am just waiting for a sign/Asking questions, learning all the time/It's always here, it's always there/It's just love, and miracles out of nowhere.' Once again the finale is spectacular, proving that they had a special knack for knowing how to seal the deal. The band's often overlooked vocal acumen really shines through on 'Opus Insert' and there's a delightful Zappa influence in the first instrumental break that always brings a smile to my face. 'Questions of My Childhood' follows and I admire the ensemble's confident, aggressive mien that manifests itself over and over in this number. Again, it's obvious that they knew exactly what they were about when they made this album. It's a totally unified effort in that no one dominates musically but I must mention that when violinist Robby Steinhardt steps up for his solo the hairs on the back of your neck stand at attention.'Cheyenne Autumn' begins as an acoustic guitar-based ballad and there's nothing wrong with that at all when it's done with this kind of tact. Not content to remain predictable, though, they move the focal point to the piano and then the track grows to involve the whole band, taking the tune to places you'd never expect it to go. They eventually revive the track's original vibe but they finish the piece with a gallant flourish. The group-composed 'Magnum Opus' is the cherry on the sundae. Its semi-Egyptian aura is deliciously prog and the vibraphone adds a jazzy tint to the proceedings. The song's energy-filled shifts in mood are exhilarating and unexpected, just the way quality prog rock should be. I'll go out on a limb here and aver that some of the tune's passages would give King Crimson a run for their money. A lot of credit for the album's consistency is due to the outstanding rhythm section of Phil Ehart on drums and Dave Hope on bass as evidenced on this cut. The lyrics sum up their awareness of knowing they weren't reinventing the wheel or curing cancer with their art. 'This foolish game, oh it's still the same/The notes go dancin' off in the air/And don't you believe it's true/the music is all for you/It's really all we've got to share/'Cause rockin' and rollin'/it's only howlin' at the moon/It's only howlin' at the moon,' Steve sings. This is a fantastic epic and a fine way to end an album.I'm alarmed at how many critics and reviewers still discount the prog content in Kansas' music in general and in 'Leftoverture' in particular. They continue to compare them to Yes, ELP and Genesis but fail to take into serious consideration that the group's constituents didn't grow up in an environment comparable to the British culture that so emphasized and revered the giants of classical music. We Yanks grew up on a thinner diet of pop and rock & roll and the overwhelming majority of our music reflects that upbringing. Kansas didn't deny their heritage but, rather, found a way to incorporate it into a symphonic prog motif and avoided turning it into the incomprehensible psychedelic mess that most did. It took patience, skill and a lot of trial-by-error but they, along with their Canadian counterparts in Rush, made the rest of the planet take note that the old world didn't have exclusivity when it came to making progressive music. We westerners could kick a little tail in that category, too. When I listened to this disc recently it was the first time in a long while and I was struck by what a band can do when they work together in an unobstructed spirit of cooperation. One rarely encounters this kind of consolidated creativity any more in this age of individuality. 'Leftoverture' may not be a masterpiece in everyone's ears but it comes damn close in mine. 4.5 stars."

          "text": "You could make a strong case for 1976 being the year when North America finally caught up with the whole prog thing, with two albums from the US and Canada released which which at last exhibited the same combination of artistic accomplishment and commercial success that the titans of British prog had been enjoying for some time at this point. One of those albums is Rush's 2112 and the other one is Leftoverture by Kansas.On the album preceding this, Masque, Kansas seemed to be in an awkward spot where they seemed to struggle between indulging their prog instincts to the same extent they had on Song For America on the one hand, and on the other hand producing more commercial, radio-friendly material to keep their record company happy. Though the album included a number of strong moments, the sense that they were second-guessing themselves hampered the album.Here, however, Kansas managed to square that particular circle through the simple means of sticking the most unabashedly commercial song on the album first and then spending the rest of the album indulging their prog side, with Magnum Opus being exactly that. Carry On Wayward Son is, of course, an absolute banger of a song - like Boston spun in a bit more of an art rock direction - but the rest of the album goes in a more classically-influenced vein (take early Genesis, take out the British whimsy, and add in some all-American swagger and you might end up in similar territory). Particularly pleasing is the prominence of Robby Steinhardt's violin at points, providing a crucial additional nuance."

          "text": "|C+| Like a delicious smoothie that didn't finish mixing its ingredients.Kansas is a very good example of the sort of rock bands that my parents loved to play in the car when I was a little boy; heavier 70s rock, done with creativity. Obviously though, Kansas is much less generic than that description; here we have symphonic prog meets AOR meets some southern-rock influences (Miracles Out of Nowhere makes this clear enough), with variations of the three in varying degrees, particularly in this album. In fact, as much as I like most of the music to be found here, it's the inconsistency of the composition that bothers me with this particular album, as well as some blatantly dated-sounding stuff, mostly as a result of the AOR style, which despite my personal fondness for it, really hasn't aged well in the slightest, and perhaps for good reason. What's more, it's often the case that each section within a piece is too characteristic of a specific rock style mentioned above, with little real cohesiveness the the whole song. Now, it's not as if I'm over- thinking/over-analyzing the music, I'm just describing what bothers me about the material as I listen to it and why.Track Commentary: Carry On My Wayward Son obviously remains one of the classic hard- rock hits of all time, with some nice touches of proggy creativity, with some of the most memorable riffs, melodies, and solos of rock history. One of the most creative tracks from an American band to receive radio play in their own country, however little that might actually be saying (speaking as an American myself). The Wall is one of my favorite tracks in all of symphonic prog, its absolutely rich in textural and harmonic diversity in the composition, which is heavily classically influenced. This was probably the first full-blown prog track with which I ever became fully familiar. As a spiritual person I have a lot of personal connection with the lyrics in the piece, \"all I am and all that I was ever meant to be in harmony,\" just absolutely beautiful. The next track, What's On My Mind, is sort of the opposite end of the musical spectrum, very dated AOR sound like Boston and Foreigner, super lame track in my opinion, though the solo section is pretty cool sounding. Unfortunately, the vocal melody line for the whole song falls flat on its face, and the ending is pretty cheesy I think. Miracles Out Of Nowhere is sort of a strange combination of (I think) southern-rock music with symphonic prog. Not a bad song, some really creative composition and beautiful work on the violin. I love the break into the fugue between the instruments, and the interesting experimentation with harmony, and especially the recitative that the singer does with the organ, though the piece itself is a little cut-and-paste sounding, not a super cohesive track, however fun it might be. Side two of the album, beginning with Opus Insert, starts off quite Genesis sounding synthesizer material, moving into the quasi-southern rock sound. I especially the love heavy synth theme, what a great melody. The piece moves into a march- feel given by the snare and bass, with the keyboard playing solo material, which is pretty cool. Questions Of My Childhood is a very upbeat track, very symphonic prog and well-done, albeit generally a bit cheesy, and the vocals and vocal harmonies bother me a bit. Cheyenne Anthem is a pretty mixed bag, with some garbage and some brilliance. Completely uninspiring vocal melodies, though the use of the childrens choir is really cool. The instrumental parts are quite good, with the section with the use of the vibraphone under the violin solo. and some characteristically Kansas prog craziness, with the instruments taking turns playing off each other, which is cool. Magnus Opus starts off like a modern classical symphony might, with timpani playing under a melody of parallel fourths from the synths (who ever saw that coming?). Plenty of interesting material on this track, some of it pretty good, a lot of it serving as a great example of rock instrumentation composed in the way on might compose a symphony, which isn't true for a lot of \"symphonic prog\", though I can't say there's too much depth to be found among all of the complexity of the work. I'm sure that for its time it certainly was an innovative and adventurous endeavor.When all is said and done, as much as I like listening to a lot of this album, I generally find it to be among most overrated of all in prog rock, mostly due to the totally inconsistent nature of their work here, with the exception of the first two tracks. Perhaps I'm being a bit elitist here, but to me the tracks themselves seem to have very little real natural flow, the transitions between musical sections within each one being either unconvincing or awkward, and the sections themselves sounding characteristic of one type of influence. What's On My Mind is probably the prime example of this. Even the material that is in good order, like Magnus Opus, never even comes close to the depth that you have with the cream-of-the-crop prog out there, which is my theory for why this album never made it to the ranking positions of the classic gems of prog.Just my two cents on the album, and this review may not even be worth that much. Nonetheless, it's a very good album worth the price (hopefully) to purchase and has some spectacular moments, with some boldly creative composition, which is always praiseworthy in my book."

In fact, if you consider yourself a progger, then you are already familiar with the album and have already made up your mind about whether you like it or not. My opinion is that it is their masterpiece, it is Kansas in their finest hour and \"Magnum Opus\" is exactly Kansas' magnum opus. Nothing short of awesomeness here, everything is perfect. Kansas became a tight knit mini orchestra of sorts with this album. The problem is this; even though their next album \"Point of Know Return\" was a great album, it was not a progression from this album, it was a small tentative step backwards probably because of pressure to maintain radio air play and commercialism. In fact, Kansas stopped progressing and became more and more radio friendly after that, without progression their best music written after that only became stale and their worst music just became run of the mill. It's a sad story that exists all throughout prog. Kansas was an American progressive band that America could be proud of, but they became victims of corporate greed. However, while it's true that progressive rock was nurtured and grown best in Europe and other countries, progressive rock (and music in general for that matter) should know no boundaries. I think it would do us all a big service if all of us would forget about boundaries and appreciate music for being universal. Open your ears and your minds and listen to music from everywhere and I will promise you that you will find gems all over the world. There is music out there that is still being made that is just as good and sometimes even better than what is produced in your own country or your own culture. Get out there and discover it."

          "text": "The unmistakable introductory a cappella refrain led by Steve Walsh in \"Carry On Wayward Son\", an excellent and dynamic song dominated by the powerful guitar riffs of the duo Rich Williams/Kerry Livgren and Livgren's keyboards, mark the starting point of \"Leftoverture\" (1976), the fourth album by Kansas and the beginning of the Americans' most popular period, and their identification within the hard rock spectrum, even bordering on the incipient AOR side that would later have Boston and Journey, among others, as its most recognisable exponents.And to some extent this identification is based on the use of direct and sharp elements typical of hard rock, not only in the aforementioned and mega successful \"Carry On Wayward Son\", but also in the raspy emotionality of \"What's on My Mind\" (great combined guitar solo by Williams and Livgren), and in the festive agility ornamented by Robby Steinhardt's restless violins on \"Questions of My Childhood\", a pair of very good songs by the way, though admittedly without the punchiness of the wayward opening track.However, Kansas' attachment to the elaborate and thoughtful symphonic sonorities are more than present and are the ones that predominate and determine the most brilliant passages of the work, as with the introspective \"The Wall\" and \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\", themes of genesian reminiscences that show great progressions of keyboards and violins, the vindicatory and sublime \"Cheyenne Anthem\", framed by a beautiful and peaceful acoustic intro accompanied by Steinhardt's melancholic singing and preceding another excellent instrumental display, but above all by the intricate and schizoid experimentation of \"Magnus Opus\", a dark and intense mini-suite divided into six sections and one of the album's high points.\"Leftoverture\", with more than 4 million units sold, is not only one of the most commercially successful Kansas albums along with the later \"Point of Know Return\", but also one of the most representative of American progressive rock.4/4.5 stars"

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "biography": "Founded in Topeka, Kansas, USA in 1970 - Continued activity with different line-ups - Still active as of 2017\n\nOriginal members\n\nKerry LIVGREN\n\n(guitar) and Phil EHART (drums) combined their two separate bands into one large band. Kerry's band was called SARATOGA, and Phil's was called WHITE CLOVER. The band changed its name to KANSAS. They were from the beginning just an ordinary rock band, but were quickly compared to other progressive bands in the 70's like GENESIS, YES and KING CRIMSON. Combining the musical complexities of British prog-rock with the soul and instrumentation of the American heartland, KANSAS became one of the biggest selling and most successful touring acts of the 1970s. With huge hits like \"Carry On Wayward Son\" and \"Dust In The Wind\", they helped define the sound of \"classic rock\". They are loved all over the world.\n\nI- THE 1970s\n\nThe Early Days: Their self-titled debut album was released in 1974, but nationwide response was slow. Their second album, \"Song For America\", saw a softening of KANSAS' sound, with more classical influences evident. The third album, \"Masque\", featured more pop songs and lyrically quite dark. They suffered ridicule from people around the world, because they wore overalls and had a violonist, which made people think that they were a country music group.\n\nThe Best of Times: \"Leftoverture\", with the popular single \"Carry On Wayward Son\", became a signature piece and pushed the album to platinum success. The followup, \"Point Of Know Return\" (1977) contained the ever-popular acoustic \"Dust In The Wind\". During their tour, they recorded their first live album, \"Two For The Show\" (1978) and the next studio album \"Monolith\" (1979).\n\nII- THE 1980s\n\nSeeds Of Change: A year later, the band followed up with \"Audio Visions\", the last production of the original band lineup. WALSH left the band due to creative differences. \"Vinyl Confessions\" had Christian lyrical content. The next album, \"Drastic Measures\" (1983), had some hard rock material on it, including the song \"Mainstream\". In 1984, the band released a greatest hits compilation, \"The Best Of Kansas\", which featured one new song, \"Perfect Lover\".\n\nThe Second Generation: The group split in 1983, only to reform in 1986 with the albums \"Power\" and with \"The Spirit Of Things\" (1988). Sales of these two albums were not very strong. Thus, the second generation of KANSAS had come to an abrupt end.\n\nIII- THE 1990s: The Third Generation\n\nThe new lineup released their second live album, \"Live At The Whiskey\", and featured live renditions of their classics. In 1995, the \"Freak Of Nature\" album featured some powerful new studio tracks. \"Always Never The Same\" featured old classics and new material, done with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIV- The 2000s\n\nSeeing the return of founder singer/songwriter Kerry LIVGREN, \"Somewhere To Elsewhere\" was released in the summer of 2000. \"Early Recordings From Kansas 1971-1973\" is a true gem. Another live album, titled \"Device Voice Drum\", is different from their earlier live albums.\n\nSee also:\n\nPROTO-KAW",

          "text": "When Queensryche emerged onto the metal scene in the early 80\u2019s they were seen as another glam metal band. With early releases such as The Warning and Rage for Order they proved that they were slightly more than that with a deep political background to many of their lyrics. However it wasn\u2019t until the release of Operation: Mindcrime in 1988 that they truly proved how wrong early assumptions were of this Seattle Metal band.\"Operation: Mindcrime\" is indeed a concept album and is even verging on a rock opera. It tells the story of Nikki a street-wise punk who relies on his addiction to keep going who becomes a hit man for an underground group. Mary is a long-suffering girl who after living by a prostitute is seemingly rescued by Father William but once again ends up being left open to abuse. Dr X is an evil twisted leader of an underground group that on the outside is a freedom-fighting group but beyond the publics knowledge lays o dark secret. These characters lives start separately but this story and this concept is knitted together fantastically as the plot develops. To tell you the whole story would take ages, but now more importantly onto the songs.Track-by-track guide:01 - I Remember Now - We open with a scene setter \u201cI Remember Now.\u201d Here we hear a half dazed patient confused as the nurse puts him to sleep. His words are haunting and this is incredibly atmospheric and is a perfect to set the mood.02 - Anarchy X - The mood continues in the short instrumental \u201cAnarchy X\u201d this also sets the scene especially of the political side of this novel as crowds are heard screaming for revolution.03 - Revolution Calling - It is the first full song and it is by all means a classic and one of the most well known songs from the album. The lyrics are deeply socialistic and incredibly thought provoking. But lyrically aside this is a fantastic song! Vocally Tate is sensational throughout and excels in the chorus. He hits the high notes and they are unbelievably high effortlessly and flawlessly. The guitars are strong and powerful and the song is in general a great one and the anthem of the album.04 - Operation: Mindcrime - The title track is not one of my favourite tracks but is a strong song none the less. It is another atmospheric track that does a lot of story telling and gives us the background of Nikki. Again haunting lyrically as Nikki\u2019s background and involvement with Dr X begins, all in all a solid piece.05 - Speak - It starts off with a very memorable riff and doesn\u2019t disappoint in general. This is another deeply socialistic song that also covers the public message of the socialist group. Some interesting ideas are conveyed such as \u2018Burning the Whitehouse down.\u2019 With a memorable riff and solid vocals from Tate it is a strong track again.06 - Spreading The Disease - It is the story of Mary and her life of suffering. It contains another haunting line as to the priests actions \u201cHe takes her every week on the altar like a Sacrifice\u201d As well as by the end a full blown political message. This song contains a great riff, with a great quick paced drumbeat to back it up. Tate is vocally at his very best again here and it\u2019s unbelievable how he hits some of the notes here, as it goes from verse to chorus it is incredible how Tate belts it out. Great song.07 - The Mission - This atmospheric progressive metal piece opens with the words of a preacher and then slides into Nikki\u2019s assassination of the priest. This is another strong song, and again Tate is strong vocally. This involves a great guitar solo too. It conveys Nikki\u2019s confusion and develops the love story that every good story needs perfectly. It shows the way Nikki\u2019s head has been manipulated.08 - Suite Sister Mary - The album's epic. More subtle vocals from Tate as well as the atmospherics from the backing church coir vocals (!) and musical side is great in the first 3 minutes until it picks up pace wise without losing the atmospherics. Of course this is the big story teller and develops the love story and Nikki\u2019s choice whether he can follow orders to kill his lover or not. The central (master)piece of the album!09 - The Needle Lies - This speaks of Nikki's confrontation with DR X and the pain of his addiction. It\u2019s refreshing to hear anti drugs from a metal band in the 80\u2019s. The drumbeat is phenomenal again as is Tate\u2019s vocals the guy is absolutely sensational. Again this is powerful, high range singing and as ever the emotion comes out in abundance. This is once again a great song.10 - Electric Requiem - It is another scene setter as Nikki finds Mary dead in her room apparently she\u2019s committed suicide and again this is incredibly atmospheric. This is as I said a scene setter but it contains a short display of vocals, which are once again incredibly impressive and softer than others in this album!11 - Breaking The Silence - Conveys Nikki\u2019s frustration and emotion after losing Mary as he calls but no answers. This is one of the more catchy songs and was one that stood out early it is again impressive and solid in every department. This is one of my favourite tracks on the album. Time and time again I am left in awe of Tate\u2019s vocals and also listen out for a nice DeGarmo solo.12 - I Don't Believe In Love - Continues the trend and is almost a case of Nikki trying to forget Mary. A real earworm song, without sounding too commercial. In truth it is a sorrowful anthem about losing the belief in love and it's connecting ideals. Again you can\u2019t fault any department and once again Tate\u2019s vocals soar through it and it\u2019s a pleasure to listen to as always. There is also some nice guitar work, with a crunching and catchy riff here and DeGarmo proves he can belt out a solo, without being over the top he makes a tuneful impressive solo.13 - Waiting For 22 - Next is another scene setter and the second instrumental of the album \u201cWaiting for 22\u201d Sure you would not consider it as a great instrumental song in it\u2019s own right but that\u2019s not it\u2019s design, it\u2019s design is to build up what\u2019s to follow and it does so brilliantly. The eerie tune works wonders.14 - My Empty Room - Another short interlude, that once again contains speech and a vocal display by Tate, both of these link us to the last song and work wonders building up the ending! Conveying Nikki\u2019s emotion before he\u2019s taken away as we await the ending.15 - Eyes Of A Stranger - The ending comes in \u201cEyes of a Stranger\u201d one of the softer and all be it stronger tracks on the album. This closes the story as we are taken back to the hospital where the story begins. All readers of this will be sick of hearing this but we are once again treated to some marvellous vocals from Tate. Haunting, atmospheric it is a perfect closure it\u2019s one of the longer songs to at 6:38. The suspected is confirmed as it is Nikki who was speaking at the beginning, his finishing words while inconclusive are haunting \u201cI remember now\u201d. The end ?To sum up this is a phenomenal album and is one of my favourite albums of all time. It has everything from a story point of view, you can pick more and more up every time you listen to it. Song wise it has everything: an anthem, love songs, ballads, an epic, short atmospheric instrumentals! Vocally Tate is one of the greatest singers in metal and rock for that matter. The great thing about the music is it doesn\u2019t show off while being impressive, and musically enjoyable to listen to. If you like any of what you\u2019ve heard of Queensryche this is something you must listen to. If you like variety, value the vocal side highly, progressive lyrics, have an interest in politics and want a little bit more form your metal this is an essential album. It is one of the most important albums in metal-history, but whom I tell that?album rating: 10/10 points = 99 % on MPV scale = 5/5 starspoint-system: 0 - 3 points = 1 star / 3.5 - 5.5 points = 2 stars / 6 - 7 points = 3 stars / 7.5 - 8.5 points = 4 stars / 9 - 10 points = 5 stars"

          "text": "If you've always associated 80s metal with stuff like Poison and Yngwie Malmsteem, and have decided to lump Queensryche in with acts like these, you're making a massive mistake. It's true that they have some definite hair metal qualities about them (their look in particular... easily one of the ugliest bands ever), but the intelligent lyrics and technically stunning instrumentation to be found on Operation: Mindcrime will show that these guys go far, far beyond what you've come to expect from this genre. O:M was their most successful album, and it's easy to hear why. Geoff Tate's vocals are amazing, as his tremendous range is on constant display, his sinister delivery complimenting the lyrics perfectly. Chris DeGarmo is one of the most overlooked metal guitarists ever, and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as anyone in the genre (he's not too shabby a songwriter either).After a short spoken intro, \"Anarchy-X\" is an instrumental guitar piece which shows that these guys can play right off the bat. Once the actual songs get going, a headbanger will be in complete paradise. \"Revolution Calling\" has a ridiculously catchy riff, and while it's hardly the best thing on here, it serves as a great intro to the epic listen that awaits. The title track is where the band's dark, cynical lyrics start to really come alive, but the music doesn't suffer in the least. This may actually be the strongest track on here. \"Speak\" has a faster pace and an amazing vocal performance, really showing Tate's range at it's fullest. There are very few weak moments from here on, as \"Spreading The Disease\" is another great rocker, \"The Mission\" is slower and tremendously powerful, while \"Suite Sister Mary\" is a dark, brooding 11 minute epic track with haunting lyrics and a frantic feel. \"The Needle Lies\" is a more straight up and agressive track with some great guitar soloing and Tate reaching a borderline scream with his vocals. From here on in, there are a lot of annoying shorter songs like \"Electric Requiem\" and \"Waiting For 22\", but that doesn't keep \"Eyes of a Stranger\" from being a stunning closer.There's word now that Queensryche is working on an Operation: Mindcrime 2. With DeGarmo no longer in the lineup, I'm not sure whether this will work out, but what I do know is that this classic first one is an amazing prog metal album, and along with Metallica's ...And Justice For All, shows that 1988 (the year I was born, coincidentally enough) was a great year for the genre. While it's arguable that Rage For Order, Empire and even Promised Land are better records, there's no denying that Operation: Mindcirme was the most successful and influential Queensryche album, as well as probably the best starting point with the band's work. So metalheads who appreciate intelligent, complex music should give it a go, as it's one of those metal albums you have to hear (although not really essencial in the grand scheme of prog)."

          "text": "We're not talking about just any album here. We're talking about Queensryche's 'tour de force', their 'magnum opus' or any other cliche that denotes sheer perfection. Yes we're talking about Operation: Mindcrime, not only Queensryche's zenith, considered by many as the apogee of concept albums and heavy metal in general. Basically we're talking about progressive metal nirvana.There is a reason that the preponderance of reviewers give Operation: Mindcrime five stars. When it comes to concept albums, it is the standard to which all concept albums are compared, it has no peers. Heck I do it myself, stacking other very good concept albums against the incomparable Operation: Mindcrime.What is a concept album? It is simply an album where each song revolves around a single concept or story.In only their second album, Queensryche scored their breakthrough success with this most ambitious concept album, Operation: Mindcrime, which tells the story of an anarchist whose disillusionment with Reagan-era American society leads him to join a shadowy plot to assassinate corrupt leaders. The band plays fabulously and Geoff Tate does both a great acting and singing job and the music as indicated is quite ambitious, featuring, among others \"Suite Sister Mary\", a ten-minute track with orchestrations by Michael Kamen.The band released two hit singles \"Eyes of a Stranger\" and \"I Don't Believe In Love\" from this album which is basically hard driving heavy metal except for these singles, which are both power ballads. Interspersed within the music are four suites of dialogue and several other cameos of short monologue or dialogue which help tell the story. These certainly add a nice touch in completing this great recording.Da StoryOperation Mindcrime begins in a hospital ward where a patient named Nikki after a pain shot from a nurse who calls him a bastard, recalls the recent rash of murders he perpetrated at the request of Dr. X. Nikki, you see, was a psychotic, cynical malcontent who was recruited and brainwashed by the nefarious Dr. X, a power crazed evangelical preacher, leader of 'The Order', to be his personal assassin.After getting Nikki addicted to drugs, brainwashed and dependent on him for his fixes, Dr. X sends Nikki first out to kill an unnamed corrupt politician, then his girlfriend Mary (an ex hooker) and the priest who got her off the streets because they are risks.After completing his mission but not remembering it, he finds Mary murdered and realizing what he has done, Nikki goes on a drug binge and ends up in the hospital, the victim of a self induced narcotics overdose. From there the songs vacillate to a series of recriminations and rationalizations with \"Breaking the Silence\" \"I don't Believe in Love\" and \"The Eyes of a Stranger\".My FavoritesIt is truly a hard choice on this album but here is my list of the four best songs:\"Spreading the Disease\"For those faint of heart you may want to stay away from this song as it's just loaded with sex and deviancy. It is the sordid tale of Mary a prostitute, whom Nikki tries to save by getting a priest to take her off the streets. This emotive song is set to heavy double base drums at a medium/fast tempo with plenty of metal accompaniment.\"Suite Sister Mary\"A ten minute and forty second masterpiece, this 'piece de resistance' starts out with Dr. X ordering Nikki to go out and kill Mary and the priest after which, \"Mary\" starts out with a solo melodic guitar and a Choir which goes on to accompany Tate throughout the song. As on the whole album there are sound effects and dialogue thrown in such as thunder and sirens. The music itself is again a highly emotional but variable paced number that is a wonderful confluence of rock/metal and opera.\"I don't Believe in Love\"In this song Nikki denies his love for Mary because he cannot face the fact that he murdered her. It is a sad melancholy power ballad. It is very melodic with a varied pace, the verses being slower than the chorus. This was released as a single because it is quite accessible and it was a minor hit even though taken away from the story it loses something.\"The Eyes of a Stranger\"This is my favorite song after \"Mary\", it is again very melodic varied tempo piece with a great guitar intro. Tate does some powerful singing here on the choruses. the song picks up speed as it goes on up to about a medium pace. Another single and again a minor hit.CONCLUSIONI have a confession to make. I don't put much emphasis on lyrics and seldom pay much attention to them, especially when they are hard to understand. Operation: Mindcrime is the exception. The lyrics are easily understood and tell a sad if not exciting, suspenseful story. I'm sure everyone will have their own interpretation of this monumental work, in my case I visualized definite similarities to the movie Manchurian Candidate.In this day of terrorism and runaway fanatical religion this classic album/story gains even more importance.There are so many nuances in the epic CD that everytime I listen to it I pick up something new. If you haven't heard Operation: Mindcrime, don't you think it's time."

          "text": "Oh boy. 1988. I was sporting a Garfield sweat-shirt, watching Ben Johnson being kicked out of the Olympics due to drugs. 'Pour some sugar on me' by Def Leppard, R.E.M. and the rising on New Kidz on the Block where on heavy MTV rotation. Also, the DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince hits with 'Parents just don't understand' and De La Soul is a newcomer on the rap scene. Ahh, a good time to be alive. Just good times.But not being a very metal guy, I always stayed away from Poison, Judas Priest and Motley Crue. And Queensryche is, to say the least, a good representation of the 88' sound. Big hair, big voice and hooker leather attitude on scene.Queensryche, being famous for 'Silent Lucidity' (another super MTV product) never got a high rating in my book. Until now. I take back EVERYTHING bad I said about this band because this record is the grandfather of conceptual Ayreon, Dream Theater and co. Torn between adrenaline and more adrenaline, Operation Mindcrime is fun to listen to and bitchslaps hair metal with a spiked glove. They are obviously skilled musicians (those bass riffs!) and Geoff Tate is nothing less than vocal royalty, with as many octaves as Mariah Carey on a good day. No kidding, Tate is a primo howler, a king of falsetto, the pope of pipes.Of course, I always want more keyboards and this album could (I said 'could') benefits of more ivory, but the orchestration is tasty overall. The REAL prog metal masterpiece before Dream Theater, have a slice and chill."

          "text": "By the late eighties and early nineties, I was listening to very little 'modern' music. I was disillusioned with the prog scene and had started listening to more blues, (my second favourite type of music). A work colleague, some 10 years younger than myself, introduced me to some new bands he was into. Amongst them were Kings X, (quite different and quite good, but not prog), W.A.S.P. (who need no introduction and are definitely not prog!), and Queensryche, beginning with this album. I found this an excellent record, and, having initially taped it off my friend, I hunted round and purchased the cd. It has been some years since I listened to it, but I still rate it highly. I am sure this album is the band's career pinnacle. The previous two albums, which I heard again through my friend, and the following one, \"Empire\", also heard through him, I found very disappointing. \"Rage For Order\" was weak and sounded like they were trying to be glam/rock without really achieving either genre. \"The Warning\", likewise did little to distinguish them from countless other, heavy guitar driven outfits, being riddled with even weaker material than \"Rage\". Likewise the E.P. Therefore \"Mindcrime\" was a refreshing and interesting, well written concept album, having been called, at the time, the metal equivalent of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\". I won't go into individual tracks here, as the album should be listened to as a whole. Highly recommended this one. So now, you will ask, why the average rating, when I think such a lot of this. Simply because this is NOT, I repeat, NOT prog! This is metal/rock/balladry, with some extended tracks and link ups. I would put this in the same category as Dream Theater, although this is, admittedly, superior. None of these bands are really prog at all, they are more the type of groups who have teenage followers, watching themselves play air guitar in the mirror. (Doubtless they have many older followers to, who wait for the family to go out before doing the same!) Sorry, but this is just mainstream rock. 4 stars for an excellent album, but only 2 for any prog tendencies. Therefore, 3 stars. A good album though. Judas Priest fans will like this, as Rob Halford has a similar voice."

          "text": "QUEENSRYCHE's famed albumOperation: Mindcrimegets rave reviews from many here, but I think that it may be best suited to a selective audience. Specifically, this ideal audience should be into a hard-rock sound and not expect music that's too innovative, and preferably should be very interested in the lyrical and conceptual ideas of PINK FLOYD lyricist ROGER WATERS. Both artists share the tendency towards bombastic, leftist conceptual albums, a knack for incredibly good sound production, and also a knack for coming up with incredibly shocking, often politically-charged statements...although QUEENSRYCHE takes that last one to a whole other level. Before I continue, I'll suggest that if you think very highly of albums like PINK FLOYD'sThe Walland ROGER WATERS'Amused to Death, then you will likeOperation: Mindcrime. If not, then you may strike out with this one, just as I did.Musically, this album is not that impressive, but certainly not awful either--the focus is squarely upon the album's concept. The music itself I would describe as hard rock...but to me it lacks the punch that I associate with metal. Certainly as a historical forerunner to the metal genre I can see why this album is so acclaimed; some riffs particularly remind me of DREAM THEATER'sScenes from a Memory, most particularly on \"The Misison\". GEOFF TATE's vocals range from beautiful and emotive to completely and totally overblown in full 80's style. The opening suite, from \"I Remember Now\" to \"Operation: Mindcrime\" proper is probably the strongest section on the album. Past that point, however, the album starts to suffer from variable quality, and ultimately falls down towards the end, with songs like \"The Needle Lies\" and \"Breaking the Silence\" seeming redundant and boring. By that point, the interstitial pieces like \"Waiting for 22\" and \"Electric Requiem\" actually begin to be better than the full songs, in my opinion, and this was the first reason for dockingMindcrimea star.In some ways,Mindcrimeseems derivative ofThe Wall, even down to a musical level in some places. Most strikingly familiar to fans of PINK FLOYD should be the use of sound effects and voices to complement the music--and I've got to say, the sound production is truly stunning, especially for when this was released. Audiophiles should be quite pleased. Musically, you may notice some similarities during the darker, moodier, and quieter sections of the album. The opening of \"The Mission\" evokes the intro to \"Nobody Home\" thanks to the use of the television clips, and \"Electric Requiem\" is very suggestive of tracks like \"Stop\". The cycling from beginning to end, though, is possibly the most FLOYD-like aspect of the execution of this album.To continue my comparison toThe Wall,Operation: Mindcrimehas been kicked up to a much greater level of vulgarity. That was what ultimately turned me off of this album. The irony is, I actually listen to musicians like OPETH who createmuchharder music than this--the difference is that OPETH doesn't make a habit out of the disgusting comments and outright slams that QUEENSRYCHE seems to revel in. Hard music (to my mind) does not have to mean spiteful lyrics and a lot of swearing--and unfortunately it's bands that do things like this that get the entire metal genre a bad name. I can live with a bit of swearing and the occasional lurid statement with no problem--used sparingly, such words can have great, powerful effects. But with the kind of overkill you find here, it just becomes grating and unpleasant. As such, I am personally displeased with this album, and it definitely cost the other star.Just like WATERS, QUEENSRYCHE's most common targets are Christianity and America. \"Spreading the Disease\" and \"Suite Sister Mary\" are probably the most outrageous lyrics-wise, but there are numerous examples of statements guaranteed to offend one group or the other. Now, just like ROGER WATERS, I've got to give it to QUEENSRYCHE's lyricist...heistalented, and you're guaranteed to find many clever turns of phrase. Unfortunately, just as WATERS started doing as he progressed in his career, one could say that the QUEENSRYCHE lyricist has quite a tendency to \"use his powers for evil\". If you do not care for highly political, anti-religious, or vulgar lyrics, this is not for you. If you don't mind, then you may be interested in picking this one up for the talented writing.Overall, I think this is one of those albums you should consider carefully before buying. For fans of ROGER WATERS, this would probably be the logical next step after exhausting WATERS' catalogue. But for those who take a more escapist philosophy towards music, such as some fans of AYREON, this may not work out. Personally, I recommend reading the lyrics first. If you can live with what is said, fine, but if not, perhaps this will save you some money."

          "text": "Arguably the first prog-metal album of all, and still one of the best I think, although I can see how the lack of instrumental prog would put many off. Conceptually this might well remind you of Pink Floyd's The Wall as it has a similar mix of drugs, sex, mental illness and political commentary. If you're a new prog-metal fan expecting a classic you will be disappointed, but this album is a real sentimental favourite with many folks from my generation.On to the music itself ... I Remember Now is a spoken word track that sets the scene in which the protagonist wakes up in a mental institution and starts to recall his past crime. Anarchy X is a brief and rousing overture, before the awesome Revolution Calling bursts out. Geoff Tate's voice powers over everything else (and when you consider the power of Scott Rockenfield's drums that's quite a feat) it's a bloodthirsty call to arms that resonates to this day. The monster title track is a creative piece of metal, with common-enough heavy verses (and a funky bass fill I always look out for that occurs twice during the song) and a recurring sinister riff that carries the song for me. Speak, Spreading The Disease, The Needle Lies, I Don't Believe In Love are all fist- clenching anthems.The Mission is one of the album's focal points, with an acoustic beginning leading into the band taking off with bold synths, and a riff to die for. The gothic Suite Sister Mary offers one of the main arguments for dubbing this album prog-metal. Baying crowds, atmospheric guitars and keyboards, gradual build-up. The closing track Eyes Of A Stranger also has nice riffs, but is strangely poppy (read Def Leppard/Whitesnake) during its verses, nonetheless builds up to an epic conclusion, which of course brings the whole album full circle.This is great metal with a progressive concept, but it's rarely prog-metal and the Chris De Garmo guitar solos really don't hold up well. Musically, it's difficult to separate Queensryche from King Diamond and I distinctly prefer Iron Maiden (both of whom were also recording concept albums around the time this came out). My fondness for this album is probably due to the context in which I head it. I heard this album soon after it came out, when Queensrchye's reputation wasn't carved in stone yet. It seemed new and fresh and it's been with me a long time. Dream Theater, Tool and the rest of the prog-metal brigade will never quite enjoy that advantage. The fact that I agree with a lot of the incisive comments on politics and religion expressed by the band certainly didn't hurt either. ... 61% on the MPV scale"

          "text": "Honestly, \"Operation Mindcrime\" is no progressive at all. It's got some progressive moments but most of the time you're listening to a melodic metal album but nevertheless.it's a great record. \"Operation Mindcrime\" finds the band at his peak. After they released this, they only did a couple of albums which were worthwhile of checking out. This is a concept album but I can't figure out the whole idea of the lyrics. I suppose this is the story of a guy who gets involved in some kind of political underground movement. Suddenly he gets orders to kill the person who looked after him. Finally he's getting depressed of all the dirty jobs he has done. Anarchy, revolution, religion and sex are the main themes in the lyrics. If you'll take a close listen to the lyrics you'll notice interesting idea's concerning the American society in 1988 which may still be relevant today. All tracks are bound to each other by sound effects similar to those Pink Floyd used on \"The Wall, almost like in a movie. The progressive elements are in the complexity of the story, the music and the sound of some guitar lines, string keyboards and especially in the wonderful epic which clocks over the 10 minutes. \"Suite sister Mary\" is the dramatic highlight of the album. The formula of using an orchestra, a choir and a fantastic duet between male and female voice may not be that new, the way it sounds is highly original even after all those years. Awesome !No real bad tracks can be found but other highlights are the powerful \"Revolution calling\" with its progressive intro \"Anarchy-X\" and the ending section which consists out of 4 emotional tracks that shouldn't be separated. Although this is not a ballad by any means, \"I don't believe in love\" has emotional melodies that are absolutely stunning but like on \"Eyes of a stranger\" I noticed some pop influences but not in a bad way. In the first verse Geoff Tate almost sounds like David Bowie but nevertheless the sound is getting rough later on and the melodies have never sounded better. \"Spreading the disease\" has some outstanding industrial influences in the thigh sounding rhythm section. Maybe this track sounds the least outdated. \"The mission\" is the most accessible track on OM, like on \"Suite\" the dramatic elements show themselves in the vocal lines and string keyboards which makes it suitable as part of a soundtrack. The sound of this album is extremely polished as you can expect from an album of 1988. Fortunately it never gets slick or too commercial.Although the issues in the concept are a heavy weight, Queenr\ufffdche manages to make it sound amazingly accessible. The intriguing idea's are interesting, the political conspiracy's are credible and the storyline is fascinating. But most of all the music is exciting. \"Operation Mindcrime is extremely recommended for everyone who likes powerful melodic rock. I would like the band to top this masterpiece with the upcoming sequel but I don't think they ever will/can do it."

          "text": "\"Waiting for days longer. Till sister comes to wash my sins away. She is the lady that can ease my sorrow. My love for her. Will help me find my way\". [nice and melodic segment] .\"They'll say my mission saved the world .\"- The MissionThis album was my first introduction to the band sometime in nineties, I think. It happened accidentally, actually, because I intended to read a review (on the net) of Marillion's concept album \"Misplaced Childhood\" and found this album was also reviewed adjacent to the Marillion review. That's about right because the two were founded around the same period even though their music is completely different. Queensr\ufffdche was formed in Seattle in 1981 when Geoff Tate (vocal) met Chris De Garmo (guitar), Michael Wilton (guitar), Eddie Jackson (bass) and Scott Rockenfield (drums) who were in a band called The Mob. Their first recorded material was a self named four track EP, released on their own 206 label in 1983 (the same time with marillion's full debut album \"Script for A Jester's Tear\"). One track titled Queen of the Reich inspired the band with its name and is still a live favourite until today. The band signed the deal with EMI in late 1983.\"Operation: mindcrime\" was released in spring of 1988 and it was the band's great success as it received gold in the US. This concept album was recorded during the spring and summer of 1987 and it took place in various studios in the US, Canada and Holland. The album has been considered as brilliant concept album of all time, musically as well as lyrically among such legendary albums as Genesis \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\", Marillion \"Misplaced Childhood\", or Pink Floyd \"The Wall\".The album revolves around a story - that's why it's called a concept album - about corruption in government. It's all about a young man named Nikki who is disgusted with the corruption in government and organized religion plaguing America. He joins an underground revolution called \"Operation: Mindcrime\" which is led and organized by the mysterious Dr. X (sounds similar with some detective story in silver screen?). The order originally meant well, but it turned out into the grasp of organized crime, with Nikki in the eye of everything. I have to admit that the band has successfully brought together many complex issues in this album. It's a short of socio-political issues. It addresses complex psychological issues such as personal identity, care, love, relationship, abuse, obsessions, roles, and greed. Well, I'm not gonna tell all the story song by song as my colleague collaborator semismart has put it nicely here.Musically, the album comprises fifteen separate tracks which is best enjoyed in its entirety instead of playing track number such and such. Yes, I recommend you to enjoy the music from beginning setups, i.e. two tracks namely \"I Remember Now\" (1:17) and \"Anarchy-X\" (1:27) , that basically set the ambient of the concept album. The true musical story really starts with third track \"Revolution Calling\" (4:42) through the blast of orchestral arrangement, guitar riffs and drumwork followed with full blown music in hard driving rhythm style and energetic mood. Geoff Tate voice is so powerful combining high and low points excellently. He is one of the best rock singers I have ever found. And this track serves like a raising a flag about the first socio-political issue mentioning the appearance of Dr. X. The music of this track is really rewarding and most importantly: it rocks man! Yeah!!!!! The following track \"Operation: Mindcrime\" (4:43) continues the stream of beautiful music in similar vein with the previous one - this time with more musical accentuation. I think the band makes their effort to describe the event when Nikki joins the underground revolution. You can hear inventive bass lines combined with stunning guitar solo and powerful voice line here. The music flows wonderfully to another excellent track \"Speak\" (3:42) and \"Spreading The Disease\" (4:07) .A true adrenalin exploder (for me personally) is when the track reaches track 7: \"The Mission\" (5:46). This track is musically perfect as it blends the elements of melancholic melody, great and simple orchestration and heavy metal music. You know why this track is an adrenalin exploder? Get your CD (oh, you haven't owned the CD yet? Come on .get out and find it from your local CD store - because it's an excellent record, I tell you. Satisfaction guaranteed.) and play this CD with me, observe when this track 7 reaches minutes 2:52 (approx) . Yes! That's what I mean man! That simple orchestral arrangement that happens shortly is the place that triggers an adrenalin explosion. That part is repeated again at minute 4:44. Nice, isn't it? Of course, this must be enjoyed with the song in its entirety. \"Suite Sister Mary\" (10:41) is another great track with relatively long duration and it's the most theatrical or operatic in nature especially combining a dialogue between Nikki and Mary (whom to be killed). This track is really great. Especially after I watched the DVD live set of this album. So stunning. \"The Needle Lies\" (3:08) is performed in full rock music style in relatively fast tempo. \"Electric Requiem\" (1:22) provides musical break with a simple arrangement. \"Breaking The Silence\" (4:34) brings the music back into rocking/ metal atmosphere. \"I Don't Believe In Love\" (4:23) is a nice track with solid bass lines and high register voice notes. The album concludes with the final track \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" (6:39) with a medium tempo rock music. The end of the track Nikki says again like in the opening track \"I remember now ..\".SummaryIt's a brilliant concept album with adventurous story combined with excellent flow of rock / metal music with changing tempo. It should be enjoyed in its entirety to get the full soul and nuance of the album. It's a recommended record. I even imagine that this album can be expanded into a movie and I think it's gonna be a great movie. What do you think?Progressively yours, GW"

I was heavily disapointed when i listened though. This album doesn't have the passion of SL, it's a very cold sounding concept album, with very little metal influence in it. It is rather cheesy and all the sound effects in the album spoiled the music for me.This is one album i will never really get into. There are too many filler tracks, IMO this album could have been shortened by about 20 minutes and sounded better. Perhaps I have misunderstood this album very much but this is a weak excuse for prog metal in my opinion, and an awkwardly flowing concept album."

          "text": "Perhaps lovers of traditional, symphonic prog will think this record far too metal for their tastes, and therefore give it a miss. This would be a pity, though, for \"Operation: Mindcrime\" has much more in common with \"real\" prog than with out-and-out, mindlessly bludgeoning heavy metal. First of all, it's a concept album, and what a concept: a dark, convoluted, positively dystopian tale out of Orwell's \"1984\", whose world view is best summed up by the chilling lyrics to \"Spreading the Disease\".In 1988, when the album came out, Queensryche were at the top of their game: an extremely tight outfit spearheaded by the immensely talented guitarist and composer Chris De Garmo and the exceptional pipes of Geoff Tate, one of the very few vocalists in the genre to prove himself much more than a simple screamer in the Rob Halford mould. They showed the world they were not afraid of pushing the envelope by creating a record which flew in the face of most heavy metal stereotypes, with lyrics that made you think accompanied by powerful, brilliantly executed music - miles away from the nihilistic violence of many thrash metal outfits or the empty posing of hair- metal bands.The highlight of the album is also the one track which comes closer to 'traditional' prog, that is, the 11-minute long, hauntingly beautiful \"Suite Sister Mary\", which also includes a choir and an orchestra (directed by Michael Kamen) performing Verdi's menacing \"Dies Irae\". The remaining tracks are more aggressive and energetic, but intelligently so, with a special mention for the rousing \"Revolution Calling\", the above- mentioned \"Spreading the Disease\" with its disturbing, half-whispered middle section, and the two closing songs, \"I Don't Believe in Love\" and \"Spreading the Disease\".There's been a lot of talk lately about \"Operation: Mindcrime 2\". This piece of news has been greeted with a mixture of hope and scepticism. Only time will tell, though I don't really think Queensryche (especially without De Garmo) will ever be able to replicate such a perfect album."

          "text": "Wow!! A lot of 5 star reviews for this album - not only here, but net-wide, it would seem.A concept album from the late 1980s - this was getting to be quite fashionable, after Marillion stunned their fans with \"Misplaced Childhood\" - an incredibly daring move in a world that was so anti-Prog Rock. Then there was THE other concept album, \"Master of Puppets\" by Metallica.But this is two years after both of those luminaries. In 1988, Metallica unleashed \"...And Justice for All\" on the world - the greatest step forward in metal since \"Master...\"; a double album of songs densley packed with complex rifferama.In comparison, then, \"Operation Mindcrime\" sounds very dated - and very similar to Iron Maiden with a large dash of Judas Priest thrown in... hang on... didn't I say that in another review about another album...?The lyrics don't really drag me in - I find them somewhat bald; Lacking any of the intensity of \"Master of Puppets\" and any of the raw emotion of \"Misplaced Childhood\", they seem to have sprung from the likes of Motley Crue or Guns 'N' Roses.The song writing is completely unspectacular also - average (and even many above average) early 1980s heavy metal riffs in standard rock song structures do nothing to create the feeling of anything progressive.Where a metal fan might get confused that this might be somehow a Prog album is in the details - the frills around the main body of the song.These frills include the plethora of additional \"noises off\", such as the introduction, and playing details; The bass sound is rich, and the bass does not always follow the riffs, the drum sound is big, but with that typically 1980s snare sound - but over-precise, taking almost all of the Rock feel out of the music.While the earlier two albums felt kind of fresh, despite the Priest/Maiden roots, Operation Mindcrime is somewhat stale, being much more of the same - a humdrum collection of riffs and razor-precision playing that raises a real yawn.To be fair, there are moments when the riffs come together that jump out from the otherwise wallpaper feel of this album.It's not the groundbreaking masterpiece that many set it up to be - you only need to hear Queensryche's previous albums to realise that they're doing nothing new; ie not progressing in any way.Compare them to Metallica, from the same time, and you realise that Metallica were the truly progressive band - each album was markedly different from the last.Queensryche merely formed a progressive kind of sound on their debut, and stuck rigidly to it.Operation Mindcrime, while not a bad album in any way, falls so shy of being actually progressive, let alone Prog Rock, that it gets 2 stars - for collectors or fans of this kind of music only - NOT for fans of Prog Rock."

          "text": "A well planned crime?Often held up to be Queensryche's \"Dark side of the moon\" or \"Close to the edge\", \"Operation Mindcrime\" does indeed find the band at the peak of their creativity. The \"Dark side of the moon\" connection continues in terms of the album's concept, although the story here is somewhat darker. (Coincidentally, this is the second album in a row which I have reviewed which deals with disturbing themes, the other being \"Island of misfit toys\" by Timothy Pure.)Full credit to Queensryche for the effort they have made in putting together the concept here and for the eloquent way the tracks link together. Having said that though, it is wise not to prod to deeply into the album, as doing so reveals it to be ratherordinary. Most of the tracks here, when heard in isolation, are straight forward metal numbers which could easily be mistaken for those by a plethora of other bands, most notably Iron Maiden. The Iron Maiden similarities, especially on tracks such as \"Revolution calling\" and \"The needle lies\", are exacerbated by the vocals on many (but not all) of the songs.The centrepiece of the album is undoubtedly the 11 minute \"Suite Sister Mary\" which is far more prog than the majority of the album with operatic vocals, and a rock opera feel. It could however have done with more in the way of instrumental passages, to break up the lengthy vocal sections. For me, the best track is \"Breaking the silence\", which is more of a ballad, with a different vocal style and some fine guitar. The closing \"Eyes of a stranger\" builds nicely to some catchy Saxon like choruses but it does sound just a bit too familiar.In all, an enjoyable album which has clearly been crafted carefully by the band. The performance is superb, if a littlesafewhen it comes to the guitar breaks. Where the album tends to fall is in terms of musical originality."

          "text": "Queensryche come with this rather long concept album. The tracks are pretty short (between 1 and 6 minutes, except for an epic one lasting more than 10 minutes). Is this record progressive metal? I think it might be a source of debate, since the sound is firstly often more hard rock than metal; secondly, the air and rhythm changes are not numerous on most of the tracks. I think this record is seen as progressive metal because Queensryche has a metal status, because this record is conceptual, and because of the numerous intros/outros a la Pink Floyd: indeed there are numerous sound effects, conversations, crowd ambience, screams, footsteps, ringing phone, motorcycle, clock, that make a pleasant transition from one track to another. The production is well made, but I think there is much better regarding progressive metal, especially bands like Symphony X and Shadow Gallery, among others. Well, the extreme rarity of the keyboards does not help at all; I like the miscellaneous electric guitar sounds without distortion, but unfortunately, they are not employed enough: that's why I think the tracks lack a bit of finish. The epic & haunting \"Suite Sister Mary\", lasting more than 10 minutes, is the best and the most progressive track of this album, so that it is an exception here: the band should have oriented their compositions more into this direction. Geoff Tate's excellent & varied lead & backing vocals are a strong point on this album. After all, maybe this record inspired prog metal bands like Dream Theater and Ayreon.Rating: 3.5 stars"

          "text": "I am not a huge fan of prog metal. And a band like Queensryche would not normally be on my listening list. However, this album has always been much discussed or mentioned on this site, so I thought I should at least give it a listen. I'm glad I did.Operation Mindcrime is arguably the first prog metal concept album. Indeed, as Marc Baum notes, the album actually verges on rock opera, having as much in common with The Who's Tommy as it does with Pink Floyd's The Wall (which I did not hear nearly so much of as other reviewers apparently did, other than the use of sound effects in and between songs).As others have described, the story is about a proto-totalitarian quasi-theocracy in which a seemingly benign leader (Dr. X) turns a drug addict (Nikki) into a mindless killer in order to assassinate the leader's rivals. Keeping Nikki under control (by feeding his addiction) is an ex-prostitute (Mary), who herself is being \"used\" by the priest (Father William) and controlled by Dr. X. When Dr. X tells Nikki to kill Father William and Mary, he reluctantly kills the priest, but cannot bring himself to kill Mary, since she is the only person who ever cared about him - and the only person he ever cared about. However, he returns to find Mary strangled by her own rosary. Distraught over her death, he is either caught or turns himself in, and ends up in a (mental?) hospital. The story is bookended by Nikki's ambiguous comment from his hospital bed, \"I remember now...\"Some reviewers have questioned whether the album is truly \"progessive.\" Although it only has a couple of non-standard time signatures (and only one instance of shifting time signatures), there is no question that the overall approach and effect are progressive. Indeed, although Floydwright mentions that certain riffs remind him of Dream Theater's \"Scenes From a Memory,\" I would go much further and say that Operation Mindrcime is the TEMPLATE for DT's masterpiece. In fact, although DT admits Rush as one of its primary influences, you cannot listen to Operation Mindcrime and NOT hear how much DT was influenced by Queensryche, both in general and, most specifically, by this album. Indeed, there are quite a few similarities between Operation Mindcrime and Scenes From a Memory, including that: both are bookended in similar fashion by the narrator; both have political overtones (admittedly more overt on OM); both have a murder mystery at their core (Did Nikki kill Mary? Who killed Victoria?); and, as noted, even some of the music on Scenes is similar to some of the music on OM (though admittedly far more progressive and technically amazing).The album's lyrics are simple, yet amazingly effective in telling the story. And as Fishy points out, some of the lyrics (written in 1987) are as relevant today (if not MORE so) than they were then - especially considering that the U.S. is moving closer to a proto- totalitarian quasi-theocracy now than it was almost 20 years ago. Consider the following, which could have been written about the Bush Administration and the socio- political climate in the U.S.:\"Seven years of power, the corporation claw, the rich control the government, the media, the law. To make some kind of difference, then everyone must know, eradicate the fascists, revolution will grow. The system we learn says we're equal under law, but the streets are reality, the weak and the poor will fall. Let's tip the power balance and tear down their crown, educate the masses, we'll burn the White House down.\"Or this, which is probably truer now than it was in 1987:\"Religion and sex are power plays, manipulate the people for the money they pay, selling skin, selling God, the numbers look the same on their credit cards. Politicians say no to drugs, while we pay for wars in South America. Fighting fire with empty words, while the banks get fat, and the poor stay poor, and the rich get rich, and the cops get paid to look away, as the one percent rules America.\"The music on OM is amazing in its relative simplicity. I have rarely heard a band get more out of fewer chords and chord progressions. And yet there is no point at which it becomes repetitive in any serious way.The musicianship on OM is also fairly simple, yet highly effective. The band is clearly very proficient at what they do, even without the technical virtuosity of a band like DT. And vocalist Geoff Tate does a fabulous job of \"performing\" the story, keeping us both engaged and in anticipation of how things will unfold. Tate's voice ranges from an almost sonorous baritone to a \"classic\" metal \"scream.\" (Indeed, Tate's tenor and \"scream\" registers were almost certainly an influence on James Labrie - yet another way in which Queensryche influenced DT.)Although not quite \"perfect\" enough to be a masterpiece of prog, Operation Mindcrime is without question a must-have for any serious progressive rock fan, because of its early entry into prog metal, its concept nature, and its influence on later bands and albums."

          "text": "Progressive metal pioneers Queensr\ufffdche released this magnum opus after taking a break from relentless touring. The Seattle based quintet had a lot riding on their next album. Vocalist Geoff Tate was sitting in a cathedral when a flood of ideas hit him and he wrote a concept album. The record follows the story of a heroin addict named Nikki whose ideological na\ufffdvet\ufffd are exploited by a terrorist organization. The band throws in as many ideas as they can, from a scathing attack on the hypocrisies of religion to love (with a nun which serves a dual purpose). Tate, who was trained as an opera singer, gives downright amazing vocal performances full of emotion. Bassist Ed Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield hold things down while guitarists Michael Wilton and Chris DeGarmo combine straight-forward riffs and solos with progressive time signature changes and bizarre sounds. The band is augmented by a string orchestra conducted by the late Michael Kamen, who also arranged the orchestra for Metallica's live album S&M. Tate is supported by Pamela Moore, who plays the role of Sister Mary, a former prostitute-turned nun who serves as Nikki's love interest and accomplice.Every song on the album combines progressive compostions with serious yet hook-heavy lyrics and Geoff's piercing cries. The only non-highlights of the album are the short interludes in between songs (\"Electric Requiem,\" \"Waiting For 22,\" etc), but they move the album forward and are expected in concept albums. Amazingly, the farfetched story comes off without a hitch as this stands as the defining progressive metal document. Highly Recommended.Grade: A"

We're talking about Operation: Mindcrime, not only Queensryche's zenith, considered by many as the apogee of concept albums and heavy metal in general. Basically we're talking about progressive metal at it 's best. One of the first albums that i own, and one of my all time fav from entire music. Absolut magic album. I will not describe the music here, because is done that already here, and i don't want to boring you with my review, so i will let music do the talking. A must, higly recommended in every way, a classic of prog music and specialy to prog metal. 5 stars for sure."

          "text": "After their last concert date for the \"Rage For Order\" tour in Montreal the band went their seperate ways while Tate decided to stay in Montreal for a while. It was there in a church where the ideas came for the concept that would be \"Operation:Mindcrime\". I was at the concert in Hamilton, Ontario where they opened for DEF LEPPARD, i remember a few friends (who were going to that concert) saying that once they saw QUEENSRYCHE they were going home. And how many times did I hear a DJ say back then that QUEENSRYCHE was \"thinking man's metal\" ? Another way of saying they were Prog-Metal I guess. The explaining of the concept has been talked about enough in other reviews so i'll concentrate on the music.\"I Remember You\" opens the album up with samples and spoken words while \"Anarchy-X\" is like the short intro song to the concept. It's catchy with samples, great bass and some blistering guitar as it blends into \"Revolution Calling\". This is where we hear Tate's vocals for the first time. I love this track and the words \"There's a revolution calling\". This song cooks with riffs and solos after 3 minutes. \"Operation:Mindcrime\" opens with the phone ringing and then a heavy rhythm comes in and some screaming guitar, and check out the bass ! \"Speak\" opens with samples and then hold onto your hat because we're going for a ride ! This is an uptempo song except for the chorus with some smoldering guitar solos. \"Spreading The Disease\" opens with tribal-like drumming. This one has quite the rhythm.There is a blistering guitar solo 2 minutes in and a lot of bottom end to this track. \"The Mission\" opens with more samples and when the song really kicks in it sounds fantastic ! One of my favourites on this album. The background synths are a nice touch as well.\"Suite Sister Mary\" opens with samples and the female vocals really add a lot to the song. You can hear it's raining and the sirens are wailing. This has some tempo and mood changes on it making it the proggiest song on the album. Thunder and rain close out the song. \"The Needle Lies\" has some killer drumming and guitar melodies. There is a nod to JUDAS PRIEST at one point with the guitar solo. \"Electric Requiem\" opens with samples again as heavy drums and theatrical vocals come in.The drummer actually plays some keys on this track. \"Breaking The Silence\" features grinding guitars and pounding drums as Tate lets it rip. This has a great sonic sound to it. Some shredding 3 minutes in. \"I Don't Believe In Love\" is another favourite of mine. The guitar intro is incredible as bass and drums throb away a minute in. It blends into \"Waiting For 22\" a similar sounding tune but less dynamic. \"My Empty Room\" opens with the clock ticking and guitar sounds,the vocals are almost spoken. \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" really reminds me of PINK FLOYD, especially \"The Wall\" in the beginning. We are back in the hospital like on the first track as it ends as it began. Tasteful guitars and a great chorus on this one.It's been a long time since I heard this album and I really thought as I contemplated listening to it again that I would probably give it 4 stars. Well it's even better then I remember. The energy and heaviness is right up my alley, and the vocals are as good as Tate has done.This is a real listening experience that still sounds as fresh as it did in 1988."

The music on this album is very guitar based, it's kinda like stadium rock with with Geddy Lee like vocals and cheesy little 80's licks, it's the good kinda cheesy, the kinda cheesy that makes you smile and pump your fist in the air.'Anarchy-X' is a great little insturmental building track and starts off the musical part of the album very well. The title track is the first clear highlight for me with a very addictive chorus. 'Suite sister mary' is the 10 minute epic on the album and is probably the most mature and melodic song on the album with some great riffs and excellent use of dynamics. 'Eyes of a Stranger' ends the album on a real strong point and is probably the best song on the album, with the most addictive chorus and the best solo.Operation: Mindcrime is a great little album if you're in the mood for a little 80's cheese yet want to stay within the prog domain then this album is definitely for you."

          "text": "\"Operation: Mindcrime\"is the 3rd full-length studio album by US power/heavy/progressive metal actQueensr\ufffdche. The album was released throughEMI Recordsin May 1988. It\ufffds the successor to\"Rage For Order\"from 1986 and as something new in the band\ufffds repetoire at the time, it\ufffds a concept album/rock opera, telling the story of the recovering drug addict/political activist turned brainwashed hitman Nikki, who becomes involved in a revolutionary group lead by the mysterious Dr. X. It\ufffds a story of questionable morality, political corruption, abuse of religious authority, exploitation of the weak, love and murder. WhileQueensr\ufffdchewere already relatively successful before\"Operation: Mindcrime\", this was the album which turned them into a highly commercially successful act too......and it\ufffds obvious why that is when listening to the material on the 15 track, 59:14 minutes long album. There\ufffds so much quality in all departments of\"Operation: Mindcrime\", that had the album, and the band, not achieved the high degree of the success that it did, it would have been a near crime.Stylistically the music is US power/heavy metal with the occasional progressive leanings. It\ufffds predominantly the 10:41 minutes long and highly impressive\"Suite Sister Mary\"(featuring female vocal contributions fromPamela Moore, a choir, and orchestration), which can be applied the progressive metal label, but there are other sporadic moments throughout the album, where that label also apply. Mostly this is US power/heavy metal though, featuring hard rocking riffs, melodic lead guitar work, a powerful and tight playing rhythm section, and one of the most powerful and skilled vocalists of the era in front. There are no words big enough to describeGeoff Tate\ufffdsvocal contributions on the album. Not only does he possess a powerful and distinct sounding voice, he is also an incredibly pathos filled singer. His delivery is commanding and every word of the lyrics are performed with conviction and great passion. He is also quite the versatile singer in the respect that he can sing both deep and really high notes with a natural ease.The album is structured so there are short interlude samples, effects, or narrative attached to many of the \"regular\" length tracks, and there are also a couple of shorter atmospheric interludes/intros, which function as individual tracks.\"Operation: Mindcrime\"features many great rockers like\"Revolution Calling\",\"Speak\",\"Spreading The Disease\", and\"The Needle Lies\", epic tracks like\"The Mission\"and\"Suite Sister Mary\", but also more melodic and accessible material like\"Breaking the Silence\"and\"I Don\ufffdt Believe in Love\". The heavy title track also deserves a mention as one of the highlights of the album. So the material is relatively varied, although there is a clear stylistic thread throughout the album.\"Operation: Mindcrime\"was produced byPeter Collinswho had recently produced the twoRushalbums\"Power Windows (1985)\"and\"Hold Your Fire (1987)\", and he has put his audible mark on the sound of the album (especially the drums feature a very characteristic sound). The sound production is powerful and detailed, and considering that it was recorded in 1987 and released in 1988, this is a very well sounding heavy metal release.So upon conclusion this is a perfect release byQueensr\ufffdche(and to my ears the peak of their career). The concept story works, the songwriting and the tracklist order are varied and keep the listener intrigued throughout, the musicianship is outstanding, and the sound production is professional and brings out the best in the material. There\ufffds not a single sub par moment on the album and a 5 star (100%) rating is deserved.(Originally posted on Metal Music Archives)"

          "text": "For a long while this metal masterpiece was in PA's top 100 progalbums of all time. And I say METAL masterpiece and not PROG masterpiece. Because even though OM has progressive leanings it demands some imagination to call this one really progressive. If I compare it to a true prog metal masterpiece like DT's Scenes from a Memory you will probably know what I mean. On the other hand you could call this proto prog metal if you feel real prog metal started with DT's Images and Words.So much for the introduction, now the album. I always felt this is more a metal than a prog metal masterpiece because first of all Queensryche was always meant to be a heavy metal/hard rock band and that's exactly what I hear when I listen to this album. Within the heavy metal world this is indeed a masterpiece because in that world an ambitious concept album like this is more or less unique. And that's why I have a bit of a problem when Queensr\ufffdche is called prog metal. Maybe they slowly evolved into one but overall their career it certainly isn't a downright example.The album is no doubt carefully crafted and flows very nicely. By the way for the decade in which this is made you can easily call this one of the greater albums. But seen in 40 years of prog history I don't think this is an essential record. Hence my opening lines. So instead of the 5 stars it would be in plain metal world or in the eighties decade I consider this more a four star effort in prog metal world. And for prog in general it would even be rounded up (3,8)."

This album may not have single-handedly invented the progressive metal genre, but it certainly popularised it, demonstrating a clear distinction between progressive and straight metal. For this reason alone (and in acknowledgment of its undoubted quality) this ought to be a part of a comprehensive prog rock collection.But ... I don't know why, this doesn't move me. Despite the excellent dynamics and composition I find myself not caught up in the story. And concept albums stand or fall by their stories. One can hardly argue with the musicianship evident in 'The Mission' or 'Sister Suite Mary'. I'm particularly fond of the choral work in the latter track. I suppose in the end I find myself lacking sympathy for the protagonist. My own personal tastes do not extend to the 80s metal sounds featured here (operatic vocals, harsh trebly guitars; give me something more visceral), but I can hear the compositional quality absent in so many other metal albums.So, the music is great. It's not something you can listen to piecemeal, but if you have an hour spare to immerse yourself in a (hopefully) unfamiliar world, this will do the trick nicely."

          "text": "The most influential album in progressive metal, PERIOD!So here we are in 1988, days when traditional punk rock has decayed into oblivion, heavy metal is having mainstream attention worldwide and is developing into something else fast, as different metal genres are blossoming as a result of the crossover and experimentation with metal and other kinds of music, such as progressive rock, and here is where my review truly begins.Just like progressive rock, progressive metal has its milestones, great albums that influenced a whole generation or generations of musicians and bands, that help identify what is progressive metal and what is not (in other words, a good measuring stick) and that help defining the genre. This album is one of those albums. Making a parallel with progressive rock, i like to say that this album is progressive metal's equivalent for King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King, because some consider it to be the first progressive metal album (just like some consider Crimson's album the first progressive rock album) and it is a very important and influential album to the genre's history, being one of its foundation stones.Queensr\ufffdche's influence can be seen more clearly in traditional progressive metal bands, such as Dream Theater and Shadow Gallery (Dream Theater had, in numerous occasions, declared that Queensr\ufffdche is one of their main inspirations). In albums such as Dream Theater's Metropolis part 2: Scenes From a Memory and Shadow Gallery's Tyranny and Room V the influence comes even in the album structure: they are all concept albums, they all have introductions that resemble a lot Mindcrime's introduction tracks: I remember now, Anarchy-X and Revolution Calling (in Scenes From a Memory the resemblance, structure-wise, is enormous: in the first track the protagonist is taken into a journey back to its past; the second track represents the process when the protagonist starts remember its past; in the third track the protagonist sees his former actions and the things he experienced in the past; in Tyranny and Room V, the resemblance in the introduction are only between the first and second tracks with, respectively Anarchy X and Revolution Calling) and both Tyranny and Room V have ending tracks that allow the story to be continued like Operation: Mindcrime's final track does.In Shadow Gallery's case, the influence reaches much deeper and can be seen even in the concept of both Tyranny and Room V. In Operation: Mindcrime, there is also noticeable Pink Floyd influence from the album The Wall towards its end, probably because in both albums the protagonist snaps and occasionally loses his sanity and both albums picture that with accuracy.The ConceptThe whole concept develops around Nikki, a heroin addict and would-be political radical frustrated with contemporary society, that is manipulated by Dr. X through a combination of his heroin addiction and brainwashing techniques and whenever Dr. X uses the word mindcrime Nikki becomes his docile puppet, being used as an assassin. Through one of Dr. X's probable associates, a corrupt priest named Father William, Nikki is offered the services of a prostitute-turned-nun named Sister Mary with whom he falls in love. Wile his feelings towards Mary grow, he begins to question the nature of what he is doing and, when Dr. X finds out about that, Nikki is ordered to kill both Father William and Sister Mary. After killing the priest, Nikki confronts Mary, but is unable to kill her and so they both decides to leave the organization together. Then, Nikki tell Dr. X that he and mary are out, but is remembered by Dr. X that only he could provide Nikki his daily fix. Nikki leaves confused and conflicted and goes back to Mary only to find her dead. He suffer immensely with Mary's death and with the possibility that it could be actually he the killer and starts losing his sanity.The police finds him at the crime scene and arrest Nikki for the murderer of Mary and his other crimes, committed under the influence of Dr. X but, because of his near-catatonic state, he is put into a hospital, where he starts to remember his story and where the album begins and ends.About the songs, musicianship and other features, there are somethings i would like to state:The songs here, unlike many metal bands from the 80's, don't sound dated: they in fact sound pretty much modern (maybe because of its broad influence among important modern progressive metal bands).The musicianship is also something noticeable and worth some consideration. Although the music here still riff-based, like most metal bands even today, you can notice that the composition style is slowly changing to melodic lines instead of a half dozen riffs used in the entire song. I mean, instead of riffing all song long with a small combination if riffs, they start to open the horizons, building more complex melodic lines and harmonies, and to make the instrumental work round there is Geoff Tate incredible vocals.Like all (or at least most concept albums) i don't think thins album can be listened in parts, i mean, you can't simply break it to the songs and listen them separately: you MUST listen the album as a whole or else it will lose its magic, its essence, something that all good concept albums have and Operation: Mindcrime also has.However, there are parts / songs that are better, such as the opening (I Remember, Anarchy X and Revolution Calling), Speak, Suite Sister Mary, The Needle Lies and the closing (Waiting For 22, My Empty Room and Eyes Of A Stranger).Grade and Final ThoughtsThis albums is really a gem. Being, arguably, the first progressive metal album, it is undoubtedly a milestone of the genre and of progressive rock as well. Also it is a great concept album (both in music and in storyline / lyrics) and, for the reasons i expressed above, i REALLY think this album deserves to have the masterpiece grade."

          "text": "There are albums that are good and make you take notice, and there are albums that transport you to a new place and time. Mindcrime for me is the latter. I bought this album as a cassette after reading an article in Guitar magazine when both were the standards of the day in the late 80's. I had no idea what I was in for.The second side of the album is some of the best 80's metal ever produced, including the great singles \"I Don't Believe in Love,\" \"Eyes of a Stranger,\" and one of my faves, \"The Needle Lies.\"But the second side is a pale comparison to one of my favorite musical experience of all time, side one, which to my thinking, should not be broken up. Each song is extremely strong on its own merit, but more importantly is part of the greater story. Perhaps the greatest fault of Mindcrime is that it's climactic moment (Nikki's decision to leave the underground) happens on side one.\"Suite Sister Mary\" is the climax of the prog masterpiece that is side one, a clean riff in 7 that includes a gothic chorus that evokes Carmina Burana or Mr. Roboto whether you're forgiving or cynical. To me, it works here perfectly and is the track that Queensryche forever wanted to make. Like much prog, at the time it was criticized for being too pretentious. Similarly, \"Revolution Calling\" was an overdone protest song that sadly has way too many truths to tell even today.When this album was released, nothing of it's kind existed. Prog metal as we know it did not exist. There were no metal rock operas. Concept albums were out of style. The only prog giant having any real success was Pink Floyd with Momentary Lapse of Reason. Queensryche changed what could be done with the metal palette created by Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Along with Images and Words, this album that moved prog metal from a fringe idea to a real genre with an audience.It is an essential part of every prog collection, metal collection, and anyone who claims they like prog metal and does not know this album forwards and backwards has some homework to do.5/5"

This concept album nearly reaches the status of a rock opera. 'Anarchy X' starts the album off, musically, in a very 'overture' like fashion. A screaming dual guitar melody followed by a fast chop gets the album going off into the main verse.and it is quite the musical journey from there. The listener can realize the quality of this records sound before then though. To put it bluntly, the album sounds great. The guitar's sound is crisp, and crystal clear. The drums are turned up a bit in the mix, just in time as they are far more intricate then earlier releases. Saving the best for last, Geoff Tate's vocal work is completely overpowering on this album. The songwriting is exceptionally beautiful, the guitar riffs sound great and have the necessary accompaniment from the vocals and drums to make each song a memorable one. While the story can be complex, the listener can get the idea without a lyric book, Geoff is really clear, even with the range and how high pitch he can get, everything is easy and understandable. This album is not dated at all, it still holds it's own, even when mixed in with the bands that changed the face of progressive metal. Surely these guys aren't as fast and technical as those they influenced, but they kept the songwriting and overall sound of the band elaborate as any. An essential record of the progressive metal genre."

Basically, this sounds like Iron Maiden discovering Rush's 2112...all the while kicking Ayn Rand in the pants. More metal than prog. Fates Warning do a better job at this sort of thing. Worth mentioning is that Geoff Tate is a master at what he does vocally - setting the bar for prog.metal vocalists on _Operation Mindcrime_. This album must be listened to as a whole to appreciate(even better to see it performed live), much like Marillion's _Misplaced Childhood_. If you were to ask me to rate this album in the early '90s, I'd have given this a very high rating. There was nothing quite like it in 1988 in the metal arena, save Voivod's _Dimension Hatross_ which is a masterpiece. In retrospect, I'd have given this a 4 star rating. As of now, I'd give it 2.5 to 3.0 rating. The production of Peter Collins seems to have muffled the cymbal work in the drum department. Everything sounds too compressed or cassette-like...except for the vocals. A pioneering effort worth checking out. Queensryche's _The Warning_ is a better start and quite progressive, sounding more like Rush with Mr. Tate on vocals instead of Geddy Lee."

          "text": "'Operation: Mindcrime' - Queensryche (9/10)Here we have it, one of the most critically acclaimed progressive metal albums of all time. This is the album that brought Queensryche from being a very underground, relatively unknown band to one of the most intriguing and innovative bands in metal.It's not hard to see why.'Operation: Mindcrime' is a brilliantly written conceptual piece dealing with pleasant and cheerful topics such as cults, assasination, political radicals, prostitution and crack addicts. Not exactly an album you would buy for Mother's Day, but all family holidays aside, it comes together to forge a dark and psychological saga that by the end of the story, actually has you feeling sympathy and pathos for the characters, as if 'Mindcrime' was a very well-written book. There are very few rock operas that can evoke that sort of reaction, and it really works to the album's favour.Every song on this is fantastic to listen to, and each could be considered a 'highlight' in their own right. However, the cream of this crop (for me, at least) would be the heart wrenching 'The Mission' and the grim epic 'Suite: Sister Mary,' which clocks in at almost 11 minutes long.While I'm not going to say this is a super-progressive album (despite the epic) I will say that the music is intelligent and effective all the way through. As opposed to a focus on complex, polyrhythmic arrangements, Queensryche steers clear and instead focuses on a more melodic based brand of prog. There are elements of prog, but the magic can always be traced back to the excellent core of songwriting.This is the best work by one of the best progressive metal bands. It's in the top three prog metal albums of all time, up there with my other two contenders, 'Metropolis Part II: Scenes From A Memory' by Dream Theater and 'Remedy Lane' from Pain of Salvation (all three being concept albums, coincidentally.)Powerful and moving; everything that music should be. An essential masterpiece."

I'm a traditional, symphonic prog lover!!But somehow, I didn't give this album a miss. And I quite like it.If you are a lover of the music in prog music, this one is acceptable. You won't claim that it's brilliant. You won't be wowed by multiple unusual time signatures, chords that nobody has ever heard or sheer virtuosity. Yet, you will not be dissappointed either. This is a good album from the beginning of the mating of Metal with Prog. It's a sign of things to come musically, not the second coming.Where this album goes way over the top is the mating of a concept to the basically good musical foundation.I say concept instead of lyrics. The lyrics are only a part of this. Lyrically a great story is told here, but the music also takes a large part in telling the story in a way that regrettably few concept albums incorporate. The prog in this album isn't from one seperate element. It's a synthesis of the whole.If this were a rating of the best concept albums ever, this would get five stars. If this were a rating of the complexity and progressiveness of the music this would hit three stars (mostly due to it's historical influence on later prog metal groups and general likeability.) So I'm taking the happy medium and giving this one four stars, mostly because I truly do enjoy listening to this.Despite being a traditional, symphonic prog guy."

          "text": "This is a bonafide masterpiece.I first heard Queensryche on Progarchives and methodically and systematically collected all their albums after this introduction. Nothing else QR have done can touch this absolutely brilliant concept album. The concert experience on DVD is even better as you can really understand the concept as you watch the visual animation. Geof Tate's vocals are amazing, he has to be one of the most powerful, accomplished vocalists on the planet. Every track on this album is part of the whole but it is possible to enjoy them individually. Here's some quick thoughts on my favourites:I Remember Now, Anarchy-X and Revolution Calling - what a way to begin an album, with a nurse visiting a patient with vindictive attitude. The guitars crash out of the speakers until we get to the melodic, metal 'Revolution Calling'. It has such a catchy chorus it is impossible to forget. Operation: Mindcrime - simply a great song that sums up the main themes of the album. Speak - my favourite track, once heard, never forgotten, and Tate is brilliant on this, he performs so well in concert too as if he is the victim and is reliving the storyline. Spreading The Disease - another very good track with high powered vocals and great lead breaks. A concert favourite I noticed too. Suite Sister Mary - I love the way it changes time signature and the female vocals are very well executed, in particular the performance on stage is a sight to behold. The Needle Lies - a classic track that is once again a popular concert track. Breaking The Silence - has a Def Leppard feel, as its radio friendly, but it still has powerful guitars from Chris De Garmo.I Don't Believe In Love - the single from the album ready for radio airplay. Very catchy and the lyrics are powerful. You will find it on the QR compilations.Eyes Of A Stranger - an excellent way to end the concept album. Very memorable and wonderful musicianship.I will not waste any time with this review. If you do not have this. Get to the CD store now and grab it. It knocked me out when I first heard it and it is comparable to other great prog concept albums such as PF's The Wall. The second part to this OM concept was recently released and is great but does not hold a candle to this.I say it again, 'Operation Mindcrime' is simply a masterpiece."

          "text": "'I used to trust the media to tell me the truth'This is often considered one of the classics of progressive Metal music. I, however, do not find the music of Queensryche to be any more progressive than that of their main influences Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Roger Waters-era Pink Floyd. These are all fine bands though, and Queensryche are not bad either! The vocals of Geoff Tate are excellent and quite distinctive and the whole band are indeed very competent instrumentalists up to par with the bands that influenced them.Operation: Mindcrime is a story based concept album and hidden behind the story line and the way the tracks are linked together by pieces of spoken dialogue and sound effects, we find a mostly ordinary but fine set of well written New Wave Of British Heavy Metal songs. The style of music involved here might perhaps be called 'conceptual Metal' rather than Prog Metal? The operatic, 10 minute plus Suite Sister Mary is the exception that confirms the rule as it is more progressive in its structure than the other songs.I often find the pieces of spoken dialogue a bit cheesy and the sound effects dated, they sometimes come across as a bit amateurish - like a cheap radio play. For me the dialogue and sound effects brings the music down (even if this is primarily what is supposed to make the music progressive).All in all, Operation: Mindcrime is a fine, albeit a bit overrated, conceptual Metal album in the tradition of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal movement and deserves to be heard by anyone with such interests."

These elements might have had a surely progressive flow. Work with the producer who had appointed it while demonstrating the frame of Hard Rock to its maximum would have been appearance of the realization to the selection of nature and music for them. The methodology to their music progressed rapidly in \"Rage For Order\" of the former work. It was one result of doing with a certain kind of establishment on Neil Kernon. They stepped forward the following one step referring to these flows. The listener might be surprised at the fact that cuts out very much by the music that they should do when \"Rage For Order\" is compared with this album and directionality and evolved.The point to have appointed producer's Peter Collins for this album might also include the point of consent and appropriate. Perfect story of idea and album that was necessary for analyzing this album completed as concept album in detail. These albums of men who had greatly evolved the perfection of the story while following a technical part in the former work had this time that had been compared well at that time with the methodology of Pink Floyd and The Who. And, Steve Harris of Iron Maiden also enumerated the name of Queensryche many times at that time. These situations will have been proofs to make the sound and the idea Queensryche had to reflect the frame of Hard Rock in artistry and philosophical thought and the tune very an embodiment. The perfection of this album that it is a concept album and is not the exaggeration to say the lock opera might be almost in the field of Prog rock. It might be an album that should be exactly called a monument with the work that expands the possibility of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal for the history of music. The element with a perfect story appears remarkably in the tune. Perfect composition and lyrics that shift from flow of \"Revolution Calling\" to \"Operation Mindcrime\". And, the story is gradually developed and the tension is given to the listener \"Speak\". And, \"Suite Sister Mary\" of the highlight of the composition and this album of the tune will lead to much for the hero of the story. The flow of the end by \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" is also indeed splendid from \"My Empty Room\". The composition power and the thought of a perfect album might be their exactly tops. And, I will describe the outline of the concept of the album.Wire-puller Dr.X of the organized crime was manipulating it as a minion of evil brainwashing loose young people who did anything to the heroin hope. He had been employed to Dr.X alone as \"Killer\" about such a young person as for Nikki. His being actually doing though it is Nikki that resentment is felt in a rotting American society, and I am doing believed that it is a necessary duty for the revolution only kills the person to obtain the heroin. The existence that such he had only trusted was sister Mary. Mary flushes her crime ? Nikki that becomes feelings that believe so and are saved. However, new \"Duty\" is received from Dr.X when is. It was the one \"Kill Mary and the father\". Mary was actually a liaison of the organization of Dr.X and it was a prostitute in men of the organization who gave and comforted his body. Father William is a corruption father who has continued to take advantage of the weakness of unhappy Mary and to play with her, and it belongs to the organization of Dr.X. When circumstances that she was filled with own disgrace were confessed, the mind of Nikki was decided though Nikki that loved Mary was suffered in the interstice of the duty and love. , saying that \"The father is killed and run away with her\". Nikki escapes with Mary successfully shooting him dead though the father tries also to counterattack. Nikki of the white plague starts living new life with Mary while suffering withdrawal symptoms. However, the interlude of Dr.X deprives them of happiness. Mary is killed. Moreover, the suspicion is multiplied by Nikki. It despairs to Nikki that loses the person who loves truly, and the spirit suffers. Nikki by which everything becomes trivial is arrested because of the murder, and accommodated by the hospital as an addict with the memory loss.

          "text": "Queensr\ufffdche's Magnum Opus!When people often think of Queensr\ufffdche, an average 80's hair metal band comes to mind for most people. That's initially what I had thought as well. After only hearing \"Silent Lucidity\" on MTV, I kind of dismissed them. I though it was a good song that just didn't really grab me much. I never did much research into their music, and discover how great Queensr\ufffdche really is.I can't say what prompted me to do this, but one day while browsing through the metal section in my local record store I saw \"Operation: Mindcrime\" in the bargain bin. This was a fairly long time ago. I wasn't really into metal at the time, and I had just recently discovered progressive rock. Genesis was my true love at the time, and that completely dominated most of my time spent listening to music. I liked Dream Theater and Metallica, but other than that I didn't have much of a background in metal.So I bought Operation: Mindcrime not really knowing what to expect. When I first put it on I was blown away. The high amount of energy, great vocals, and memorable melodies immediately captured my attention. I'm still not sure if I would categorize this as \"prog\" or not, but who really cares? It's an excellent heavy metal album that should be heard by anyone interested in the genre.The progressiveness lies in the fact that this album moved heavy metal as we knew it to a new level. I believe progressive metal had been \"discovered\" in 1985 by Watchtower, but this album is what popularized the genre. While not progressive metal in the vein of Dream Theater or Pain of Salvation, this has a unique blend of Queensr\ufffdche's American take on NWOBHM, some symphonic structures, and a concept-driven layout.Thatis why this is prog-metal. Not because there are 20 minute shred-sessions in every song! It's because of the intricate details that really make a difference.If you are going to listen to one Queensr\ufffdche album before you die, hear Operation: Mindcrime. This is one of the most popular and influential albums in the progressive metal genre, and with good reason. Each song is great in its own right, but this really is meant to be listened to as one epic concept album.THE MUSIC:\"I Remember Now\"- The album opens up with a short spoken-word opening. Near the end it has an ominous keyboard sound.\"Anarchy-X\"- The first actual \"song\" is an instrumental, overture-like track. It has pounding bass, cool keyboards, and great rhythm. It has a well-performed guitar solo near the end, making for a great opening track.\"Revolution Calling\"- This has one of the most killer riffs in heavy metal. This is one of those songs that just gets you \"pumped\" so to speak. Geoff Tate delivers an excellent vocal performance, and everything about this song is absolutely perfect. This is one of my favorite Queensr\ufffdche songs.\"Operation: Mindcrime\"- After the mostly light and upbeat previous track, the title song is a little darker. The bass playing from Eddie Jackson is great, and it shows why he's one of my favorite heavy metal bassists. The chorus is catchy and upbeat, and I think that's definitely a strong point for Queensr\ufffdche in general. They have the ability to create excellent choruses. To be honest, every song on Operation: Mindcrime has a memorable chorus. This has a good guitar solo near the end as well.\"Speak\"- This opens up with a fast guitar riff and an energetic bassline. This is a pretty standard verse-chorus-verse song, but all of the verses and choruses are perfectly executed. Again, this has a classic Queensr\ufffdche chorus, with Geoff Tate's excellent vocals.\"Spreading The Disease\"- A drum rhythm opens up this song with a powerful guitar riff. The verses sound similar to Iron Maiden, with a galloping bassline. Geoff Tate delivers another excellent vocal performance, and I think in the late 80's and early 90's he was one of the best heavy metal vocalists. The chorus is catchy and counteracts with the verses well.\"The Mission\"- This opens with a short sound effect and spoken word passage. It is followed by a haunting acoustic guitar. It soon builds into the classic Queensr\ufffdche sound, with a cool orchestral-sounding keyboard melody. Some great chord progressions with an excellent guitar solo serve as an excellent bridge. The song structure of this song is spectacular.\"Suite Sister Mary\"- At almost 11 minutes in length, this is an epic track that is the longest on the album. It never tires or disappoints, and I think this is a satisfying progressive metal song. It features a dramatic twist in the story of the album as well. This mostly has a dark and moody feeling, and it represents the story well. This has an operatic feeling, and the choir helps contribute to that. This has some killer riffs as well, and this 11-minute tour de force is a highlight of the album for sure.\"The Needle Lies\"- Despite it's brevity, this is one of the finest songs Queensr\ufffdche has to offer. The absolutely wonderfully crafted riffs and chorus are absolutely magnificent. This sounds very much like Iron Maiden, which is a good thing in my book. Geoff Tate delivers another great vocal performance.\"Electric Requiem\"- This song is a haunting keyboard-driven track with a repetitive drum beat. It has some nice guitar near the end.\"Breaking The Silence\"- This song is a standard verse-chorus-verse song, and it never much appealed to me. The chorus is pleasant enough, though.\"I Don't Believe In Love\"- Pretty much a \"power ballad\", with some really great moments. I love the chorus here, and it has that distinct Queensr\ufffdche sound. This song is exceptionally melodic. The guitar playing from Chris De Garmo and Michael Wilton is very good on this track.\"Waiting For 22\"- This is a short instrumental piece that builds off of a guitar melody with some soloing. It fits the mood of the album well.\"My Empty Room\"- This is another short track, but I think it's absolutely wonderful in the concept of the album. It never gets heavy or anything, but it is an excellent piece. Geoff Tate delivers a powerful vocal performance right before the grand finale in the next song.\"Eyes of A Stranger\"- The last song on this album is one of my favorites for sure. It is a pretty epic finale to the album, and I think it is a solid closer. The bass is powerful, the keyboards add another layer to the music, and the vocals are great. This has a good variety of moods, and I think that's what makes a good ending in a concept album. I absolutely love the chorus to this song. This is a trademark Queensr\ufffdche song. It is so powerful and beautiful. Absolutely perfect!Conclusion:Operation: Mincrime is fully worthy of my highest recommendations: a 5 star rating. Let's face it. This is THE most influential album in progressive metal. This is the best Queensr\ufffdche album, and it transports you to another world. This is absolutely essential listening. I'm not sure if this is 100% \"prog\", but who cares? This is one of the finest albums I have ever heard, and that's saying something. This is a five star rating without a doubt in my mind.5 stars."

It literally kick-starts with with the screaming guitars ofRevolution Callingand doesn't slow down untilSuite Sister Mary. After that the album shifts into a darker territory both thematically and musically. This second act is filled with highlights such asBreaking The Silenceand finallyEyes Of A Stranger.The metal scene of the '80s definitely needed some new and innovating ideas in order to maintain its popularity into the new decade and I personally considerOperation: Mindcrimeto be one of those landmark albums that shaped the modern Progressive Metal genre into what it is today. Its well-written music and concept, slick production and original take on the genre really made it into the classic that isOperation: Mindcrime.Although it might not be one of the absolute best concept albums ever made, from a Progressive Rock point of view, I still highly recommend this record to all fans of well-written metal albums.***** star songs: Anarchy-X (1:27) Revolution Calling (4:42) The Mission (5:46) The Needle Lies (3:08) Eyes Of A Stranger (6:39)**** star songs: I Remember Now (1:17) Operation: Mindcrime (4:43) Speak (3:42) Spreading The Disease (4:07) Suite Sister Mary (10:41) Breaking The Silence (4:34) I Don't Believe In Love (4:23) Waiting For 22 (1:05) My Empty Room (1:28)*** star songs: Electric Requiem (1:22)Total rating: 4,34"

But again, as a metal concept album, this would probaby rate four or five stars. But since we are grading for prog here, the best I can give this one is three stars."

          "text": "After the rather transitional and forgettable Rage For Order, Queensryche went the full-on concept album route with Operation: Mindcrime, which is much-acclaimed in progressive metal circles but in its earlier CD versions fell rather flat with me. I can find that on the 2003 remaster (and with speakers/headphones with better bass) I can better appreciate some aspects of the music, particularly Eddie Jackson's bass playing, which manages to be progressive and complex without being flashy or stealing the scene.Like Pink Floyd's The Wall, the band weave in sound effects and snippets of dialogue at points to create the impression of a narrative, but it's best not to try and concentrate on it too much and concentrate on the music. This rather more straight-ahead fare than the band's self-titled EP or The Warning, but there's some undeniably catchy stuff on here.That said, I still think an issue with this album is that it's one of the first metal concept albums to have taken advantage of the longer running times available on CDs, which made it possible to produce longer albums without going to the expense of making a double album. In this instance, I feel like some of the album ends up being a bit slack. Had this been a 40-minute album, perhaps it could have sustained my interest better, but as it is the ideas presented seem rather thin on the ground (and the political angle to the story is really quite laughable, on the level of a bad Steven Seagal movie). I think I get the appeal of this one more than I used to (and have revised my rating up accordingly), but I don't think it quite deserves the classic status often attributed to it."

          "text": "Although somewhat regrettably Queensryche would ultimately fail to deliver upon the huge promise shown by this defining concept-album, thanks, in part, to the limited confines of the metal genre, few groups in the burgeoning prog-metal scene can lay claim to creating such a renowned and influential piece of work as 'Operation: Mindcrime'. Released in the dark and very un-progressive days of the late-eighties, 1988 to be precise, this unsettling album blends the bruising power-metal typically found in NWOBHM outfits Iron Maiden and Judas Priest with arty and deceptively-complex Marillion-and-Pink Floyd-style instrumental chops, crafting their potent new sonic brew into a complex, bizarre and darkly-satirical sci-fi themed tale of paranoia, mind control and sinister totalitarian governments that casts an ominous atmosphere over the fifteen interlocking tracks. Almost an hour long, this is fairly extreme yet really ambitious stuff, obviously influenced in some part by Pink Floyd's similarly-toned 1979 opus 'The Wall'. However, whilst this is not quite at the same level, Queensryche have not forgotten to insert catchy, anthemic hooks into their cerebral material - something the Floyd almost forget about when creating their double-sided tale of rock star excess - thus pulling off the savvy trick of making a potentially pretentious concept album remarkably accessible. Tracks such as the fist-pumping opener 'Revolution Calling' find vocalist Geoff Tate pulling off his best Brice Dickenson impression, all the while backed by screeching guitars, whilst the ultra-heavy riffs and funk-pinned bass-lines of the follow-up title-track show a group flush with confidence. The thunderous pace slacks off slightly during the album's latter half - the ten minute epic 'Suit Sister Mary' takes a while to heat up - yet when listened to from beginning to end(which uis obviously the point here) 'Operation: Mindcrime' proves an engrossing, if slightly brutal, listen. Conversely, when listened to separately, the individual tracks power is somewhat diluted, yet ultimately, and thanks to the overall quality running through the album, it's a moot point. Compared to today's prog-metal exponents it may all sound a mite tame - this critic is no metal expert - but surely that's one of the main reasons the album has proved to popular over the years. Certainly one of the (very) few prog-metal albums that appeals outside it's immediate fanbase, 'Operation: Mindcrime' is an impressive beast indeed.STEFAN TURNER, STOKE NEWINGTON, 2012"

          "text": "A milestone in the progession of metal! By successfully combining their NWOBHM influenced traditional metal with the asthetic atmospherics of Pink Floyd, QUEENSRYCHE created a metal masterpiece of the sort that combined all the drama of an opera with a storyline about a disillusioned recovering drug addict named Nikki who joins a revelutionary group and all the twists and turns that such dramatic events involve.The storyline is succint and to the point and doesn't get off on any tangents. What impresses me more than the storyline is the music itself. The tightness of the band and the perfection of Geoff Tate's vocals make this album feel like one continuous track. Every moment seems like it fits the mood and the added cast characters, choir and sound effects make this one of the best albums of all the 80s if not of all time. The one thing that bugged me for the longest time is that the last track \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" begins sounding almost identical to the progressions in \"Welcome To The Machine\" on Pink Floyd's WISH YOU WERE HERE. I have come to terms with it realizing it to be a simultaneous nod to both the band and the theme of a song since both convey healthy doses of paranoia. It only lasts until the band begins to play so I got over it and it does sound really well done.The argument of whether this is progressive or not doesn't matter to me. This is great music. I would call this for the most part melodic traditional metal with some clearly progressive tracks (\"Suite Sister Mary\" being the most so). One of the best concept albums ever to emerge in any genre."

          "text": "Operation: Progmetal4.5 starsWhat an evolution since \"The Warning\", released only four years before! Initially considered as an IRON MAIDEN rip- off, QUEENSR?CHE has simply offered to the world one of the very first metal concept album. Later, vocalist Bruce Dickinson himself will admit that MAIDEN's most progressive album of the 80's - the very good \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\" - was not as elaborated as this opus. Furthermore, people often even assimilate \"Operation: Mindcrime\" to a heavier version of PINK FLOYD's \"The Wall\". Indeed, the compositions are ambitious, elegant and refined. However, is this comparison really justified?The lyrics narrate the story of Nikki, a former junkie frustrated with contemporary society. He will become part of a secret revolutionary organization, led by a political and religious leader nicknamed Doctor X. This mysterious demagogue manipulates Nikki with his heroin addiction and brainwashing for a political murdering operation called 'Mindcrime'. How does all this musically translate?After the short spoken introduction \"I Remember Now\" comes \"Anarchy-X\", a powerful instrumental opening. \"Revolution Calling\" is a great heavy metal achievement with its uncommon drumming and beautiful guitar solo. The title track is an enjoyable mid tempo 80's hard metal with a cool bass line, whereas the aggressive and complex \"Speak\" is just a prog metal little gem of and features numerous changes. Then arrives \"Spreading The Disease\", both threatening and epic, followed by \"The Mission\". I'm not a big fan of this song which I find rather average.The second half is bit darker. Longest and most progressive track, the 11 minutes theatrical \"Suite Sister Mary\" alternates dark and haunting atmospheres. Undoubtedly the highlight of the disc! The band's initial IRON MAIDEN roots are still slightly perceptible with the energetic \"The Needle Lies\". After the short ambient sung transition \"Electric Requiem\", \"Breaking The Silence\" is heroic and touching, due Geoff Tate's typical plaintive singing. \"I Don't Believe In Love\" is also pleasant, while the short interludes \"Waiting For 22\" and \"My Empty Room\" are calm, pretty and floating. The record concludes on a sinister and pessimistic tone with \"Eyes Of A Stranger\".\"Operation: Mindcrime\" is just one of the most important albums of the progressive metal genre. Although a little pompous at times and still sounding very eighties, it provides sophisticated compositions, rhythm changes, and the inspiration is overall constant. Is this an \"heavy metal opera\"? Maybe... If so, this deserves to be transcribed in a movie, like \"The Wall\". Maybe this will be already the case when you'll read this review...Now that we talk about it, how does this disc finally compare to PINK FLOYD's well-known double opus? Well, here the music only borrows 70's progressive elements, as the palette of instruments and ambiances are not as wide and varied. The short interludes and tracks complexity can remind \"The Wall\" in the spirit, but I find the general comparison a little too exaggerated.Neither similar to FATES WARNING's dark tortured style nor to DREAM THEATER's, \"Operation: Mindcrime\" still remains QUEENSR?CHE's summit and a major influence of the genre. Highly recommended to prog metal fans!"

But to me,Operation: Mindcrimeis a genuine masterpiece of rock music.To me, there are three components by which to judge an album: composition, production, and performance, and all three are excellent onOperation: Mindcrime.In terms of production,Operation: Mindcrimehad a great sound when it was first released on CD in 1988. In particular, the album is mixed well, especially given that on most songs, there's more going on than one part each from a singer and four instrumentalists. In addition to an orchestra and choir on \"Suite Sister Mary,\" there are additional guitar and synthesizer parts sweetening many of the tracks. And then there is the expansive use of backing and harmony vocals. Finally, the rhythm section (bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield) sounds fantastic throughout. I'm not sure whether the band wanted to work with producer Peter Collins because of his symphonic inclinations, or whetherOperation: Mindcrimesounds symphonic because of him. Either way, even given the ambitious album concept, the production and arrangements are themselves ambitious, and Collins proved up to the task.The performances are also very, very good. This includes, in particular, the lead guitar work, shared by Michael Wilton and Chris DeGarmo, and the vocal performances by Geoff Tate.But, of course, great playing and great production will only get an album so far. The strength ofOperation: Mindcrimeis in its composition. The album is neither a libretto-focused musical, nor simply a thematic collection of songs. It's a bona-fide concept album with a storyline and distinct characters, although it takes a few listens to figure this out. At the same time, most of the songs stand by themselves; two even made the Billboard rock-airplay top 40. Interestingly, these two (\"Eyes of a Stranger\" and \"I Don't Believe In Love\") are the last two proper songs on the album, and in my opinion, are two of the weaker songs here. The best is the dark, baroque \"Suite Sister Mary,\" the nearly 11-minute centerpiece of the album - - but even without this track,Operation: Mindcrimewould be an excellent work.There must be some who think thatOperation: Mindcrimeis self-important pomp - - and I suppose that's true. With its sound effects, instrumental interludes, and guest vocalists, combined with Tate's sometimes stiff, and often operatic vocal delivery,Operation: Mindcrimeborders on bombast in places. But it's the kind of near-bombast I enjoy, especially as part of a self-contained work.I unreservedly recommendOperation: Mindcrimeto any fan of progressive rock music, even to listeners like me who don't ordinarily care for progressive metal.

          "text": "The highly-acclaimed \"prog\" masterpiece from one of the 1980s' iconic hairbands.1. \"I Remember Now (1:17) a hospital-based radio play that sets the scene for this concept album.2. \"Anarchy-X\" (1:27) one forgets the advantages of having two guitarists--and a good drummer. (4.25/5)3. \"Revolution Calling\" (4:42) too bad the drummer's been housed in such a poor sound from the 80s-influenced engineer. Coming from listening to Voivod all morning I'm quickly reminded that Queensr\ufffdche is no punk rock holdover much less a Tech/Extreme Metal wannabe; these guys are full on 80s hairband with half of their focus on looks/appearances and theatricity. Musically this is not a very special song, just solid. It must be in the lyrics that the this song and album have their value. (8.5/10) 4. \"Operation: Mindcrime\" (4:43) solid song with a surprising amount of space and sloth-like speed. Again, it must be the words and vocal performance skill of Geoff Tate that earns this song and album such a solid fan (and critical) base. It's a well-performed, well-produced song with a memorable chorus hook. (8.75/10)5. \"Speak\" (3:42) Geoff Tate gives quite a remarkable vocal performance on this one. A nice controlled song with some well-constructed shifts between motifs and a couple of inventive entertainment hooks--including the male choir's repeated bass chant. Again, too bad about that 80s drum sound. (8.875/10)6. \"Spreading The Disease\" (4:07) The 80s drum sound is especially annoying in a straightforward rock 4/4 beat. Very interesting ending with an effected drum fadeout. (8.25/10)7. \"The Mission\" (5:46) multiple guitar arpeggi over which Geoff sings in a very theatric pleading voice. At 1:23 the whole band shifts into drive with some pretty standard hairband rock riffing and singing. Aside from the interesting syncopation in the chorus and some nice harmonized guitar twinning around the three-minute mark, this could literally be any hairband from the 1980s. Still, this is very well done; I can see why this song could become a fan favorite. Definitely a top three song for me. (8.875/10)8. \"Suite Sister Mary\" (10:41) the plot thickens--a murder plot; a coven of religious zealots chanting their angry truth, the crime committed. Again Geoff starts off with a very theatric vocal . The presence of the choir must geek a few people. But then a guitar throws down a riff of power chords to signal a shift into a more MEAT LOAF-like passage (which then turns RUSH at 3:48). The drummer's disco foot pedal drives the song forward until the shift into the choral-infused section. Back and forth the band switches from motif to motif, extending this (unnecessarily?). Entertaining but forgettable. (17.25/20)9. \"The Needle Lies\" (3:08) It's, it's, it's the Ballroom Blitz! (How any band wants to replicate this monotonous shuffle-- especially with the 80s engineering choices--I can't figure out. It must be a drummer thing.) It's all I can hear! (8.25/10)10. \"Electric Requiem\" (1:22) interesting (until the awful sound of the snare hit accosts). Develops nicely but then suddenly ends. Why? What was the purpose? (4.5/5)11. \"Breaking The Silence\" (4:34) A very nice 80s song with a kind of ROBIN TROWER remnant guitar riff in the forefront; even the stereotypic hairband power chords can't totally destroy this one. A top three for me. (8.875/10)12. \"I Don't Believe In Love\" (4:23) another very nice 80s sounding song--with great rolling bass play and FIXX--like sound to the guitar strums. My final top three. (One last question: Is the Mindcrime story over? Has the concept album story finished? This song doesn't seem to fit the story line.) (8.875/10)13. \"Waiting For 22\" (1:05) nice guitar \ufffdtude. (4.5/5)14. \"My Empty Room\" (1:28) ticking clock, guitar arpeggi, and Geoff's plaintive vocal sound awesome, but then all hell breaks loose at the very end. (4.75/5)15. \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" (6:39) opens with a collage of PINK FLOYD scenes (from both The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon) but then turns into a solid heavy rock song--one that is, again, unfortunately, quite typical of the \"metal\" scene of the 1970s and 80s. Great performance from Geoff Tate. The dude has really grown. Too bad that one of the main musical hooks of the song seems to come straight out of AC/DC's \"Hell's Bells.\" (8.875/10)Total Time: 59:16Unfortunately, my criticism of this album is biased by my tendency to lump all hairband music from the 1980s into one category, but, in my defense: it does all sound very much the same to me.B/four stars; a nice addition to any prog lover's music collection--especially if you're into the 1980s classic hard rock/\"metal\" scene."

          "text": "Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "name": "QUEENSRYCHE",
      "genre": "Progressive Metal",
      "country": "United States",
      "biography": "Founded in    Bellevue, Washington, USA in 1981 (as The Mob) - Still active as of 2019\n\nQuite simply, Queensryche was one of the essential bands in the development of progressive metal. Merging the metal of Iron Maiden with the atmospheres of Pink Floyd, the band created what may still be the quintessential metal concept album, OPERATION: MINDCRIME. The band's sound has centered on the operatic vocals of Geoff Tate singing over numerous versions of heavy rock over a 30 year career.\n\nStarting in the early 1980's in Seattle, Washington, guitarists Chris Degarmo and Michael Wilton, along with bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield, were in a cover band, the Mob, cutting their teeth on the work of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Singer Geoff Tate of local progressive bands Babylon and the Myth was brought in sporadically for gigs and then an EP. The EP, fueled by the anthemic \"Queen of the Reich\" gained the band national exposure. The band acquired Tate permanently, changed their name in honor of their then signature song, and were signed to EMI.\n\nInitially tagged as an Iron Maiden descendent, Queensryche folded in more and more progressive influences under Tate and DeGarmo's direction on the LPs THE WARNING and RAGE FOR ORDER. The latter is one of several albums that may be considered the first true progressive metal album, as it melded keyboards, conceptual themes, and more complex song structures. However, Queensryche's defining moment was the full concept album from 1988, OPERATION: MINDCRIME. Its ambitious story covered government, religion, sex, drugs, and mental illness. The interconnected songs included an over ten minute epic, several MTV hit singles, and fueled the band's rise supporting several of the top metal tours of the time.\n\nThe following album, EMPIRE, took an intentionally more commercial tone and catapulted the band to major arenas where they performed MINDCRIME in its entirety as a headliner. The Pink Floyd influenced single \"Silent Lucidity\" was one of the major hits of the year. This would be the band's peak with eclectic PROMISED LAND being the last of the band's classic era. Musical tastes had changed, and the band attempted unsuccessfully to accommodate to alternative / grunge with HEAR IN THE NOW FRONTIER. DeGarmo left the band soon after, and Queensryche has had an up and down career. TRIBE and OPERATION: MINDCRIME II were much better received than their predecessors, and the band's continuing tours have included co-headlining with fellow prog-metal pioneers Dream Theater. Though never reaching their early 90's heights, the band still produces \"thinking man's metal,\" and their place in the history of progressive metal is without question.",

La Cathedrale De Strasbourg is simply gorgeous with subtle singing and delighful bells and percussions. Birth by comparison pales a bit but is still a fine classical rework tune and a highlight on almost any other Focus album.But the Concerto in itself is the real gem taking up a full side of vinyl, each movement being named after a manner of cooking the hamburger. For once I cannot blame Focus to stretch out an idea too long. This 20 min+ track is absolutely stunning and is riveting you to your sofa until the track is over. This is the album to prove that even almost instrumental prog can full of humour without proper lyrics.Easily their better album , I can assure you that you will not regret this."

          "text": "The Burger KingsBy far Focus' best, most complete and accomplished album.Although \"Hamburger Concerto\" itself only occupies the second side of the LP, the whole album flows beautifully from start to finish. There's nothing like \"Hocus Pocus\" here, or the rambling jazz laden indulgences of other albums (\"Focus 3\" comes to mind). Instead what we have is a classically constructed piece of pure smooth prog rock. Guitar and keyboards share the lead most of the time, with Van Leer's flute and vocals (sounds not lyrics) kept relatively brief.There really isn't any point in going into individual track details, it's very much an album to hear from start to finish. The closing section of \"Hamburger concerto\" (\"One for the road\") however is stunning, Akerman's guitar work being reminiscent of their beautiful single \"Sylvia\".A beautifully constructed and performed album, which surpasses by a country mile anything else by the band. The CD version has one extra track, an early version of \"Birth\".The sleeve notes talk about the album beingpremastered(not remastered) whatever that means!"

          "text": "This Dutch Quartet revolutionized the rock world in the early 70's in large part due to the unparalleled talents of Jan Akkerman & Thijs Van Leer. The first gentleman is a guitarist extraordinaire, both on acoustic or electric , as well as a world class master of the medieval luth. Thijs on the other hand, is an accomplished ivory tickler (harpsichord, piano and mostly Hammond organ) as well as a master flutist. Previous albums, Moving Waves and 3 were steeped in the extensive \"Jazz-Jam'' style, long riveting tracks loaded with blistering fretwork and towering interplay with flute and organ. Why this album remains a treasure 30 years later?Hamburger Concerto is the crowning achievement of Focus' career, as subsequent albums clearly lack the sizzle and fire of this masterpiece. From the opening renaissance intro \"Delitiae Musicae\" , the listener is in for one hell of a ride, a musical journey of epic proportions, with a mature sound and an obvious search for perfection. \"La Cathedrale de Strasbourg\" is warmly enchanting. The side long Hamburger suite is a divine slab of first rate prog-rock. Check out the sheer thunder and passion of Akkerman's guitar on \"Birth\" , arguably one of the finest 10 solos ever recorded.If you do not own this jewel, I suggest to return to your country album collection and stay there! Your punishment is deserved and you have been warned.5 toasted buns"

          "text": "Baroque and Roll is only one of the many eclectic ways to describe the wonderful sound of Focus on the Hamburger Concerto album. The baroque influence shines through here more than on any other album previous but the music is consistently as strong as the previous two studio albums at least. No yodelling here as on \"Hocus Pocus\" which kicked off Moving Waves but the opener proper (after \"Delite Musicae\" served as a fine gentle prelude) on this album while not being the forceful driving rock anthem that \"Hocus Pocus\" was still bears an identity to the hard rock traits of Focus and especially the guitar playing of Jan Akkerman and in fact both songs come from the same common ground musically and even the names of both have a trait in common too but it would be wrong to state that Focus were trying to achieve the same effect as both tunes are quite different, \"Hocus Pocus\" is a unique track that could never be copied without it sounding too blatant. I even heard some whistling in there somewhere... If Focus are a progressive rock, which they have been cited as, then they are like no other. In my opinion the typical prog rock outfit takes themselves too seriously but Focus add humour to their depth of textures and allow some fun to creep into the songs while never losing face. The rocking \"Harem Scarem\" has some odd noises thrown in for good measure alongside some fluid and clean musicianship as is par for this entire album which is joyful and a fine exploration of varying styles like the afore mentioned baroque with the lute making sweeping moves. But it is the guitar playing which is the biggest draw for me when listening to Focus and in that department they never fail to excite. Hamburger Concerto is an electrifying album with a sense of theatre involved in the execution and arrangement, especially on the 20 minute plus title suite. It is unlike anything else in my book and certainly works better than previous lengthy workouts. I still cannot split their first three albums, they all have their own merits but they might just have progressed a little more with the Hamburger Concerto. A band this consistent merging good songwriting talent with carefully executed musicianship must be heard. Focus is an apt name for a band who play this sharp."

          "text": "Dutch Progressive rockers, Focus produced their masterpiece in 1974 with the brilliant classical-rock album, \"Hamburger Concerto\". The band largely abandons the long and boring jazz driven jams they had indulged themselves with on previous albums, and made a surprisingly focused and elegant album, which has dated very little in 30 years, compared with others from its period. This is due mainly to the diverse and gorgeous instrumentation of master guitarist Jan Akkerman and Flutist (no we aren't called Flautists) and Keyboardist Thijs Van Leer. On this album, one can hear all the classic rock instruments, as well as beautiful Harps, Harpsichords, Bells, and Castanets, etc.The album begins with \"Delitae Musicae\", a short and Renaissance flavored intro, which instantly sets the classical mood of the album. This segues into the rocker, \"Harem Scarem\", which was the album's obvious 'single'. It is a rock piece which features insane 'Yea Yea Yeas' from vocalist Van Leer, and frantic and impressive guitar and piano. This six minute piece manages to change mood relatively quickly and often though, shifting from the jazzy open, to the beautiful acoustic midsection with Van Leer's ever-present Flute. (Of All things one even hears an accordion on this very good track!) The frenzied energy of \"Harem Scarem\" changes instantly into the beautiful piece, \"La Cathedrale de Strasbourg\", a song complete with stately church organ and bells, and very calm vocals. This song evokes the grandeur and majesty of the Cathedral in Strasbourg quite well, and is a relaxing album highlight, which even features Van Leer whistling (no, not yodeling) at the end. \"Birth\" is my all-time favorite Focus track. This seven minute song is pure beauty. It features shifting solos between the talented Akkerman and Van Leer on Piano, Organ, and Flute. Unlike many prog- rock instrumentals, this one isn't about technical pyrotechnics; it is extremely tasteful and manages to highlight the extreme skills of each member while maintaining musical credibility. (The flute on this track truly is amazing, as is Akkerman's monstrous Guitar solo at the end.) That just about wraps up Side One. Side Two features the two minute suite, the \"Hamburger Concerto\". This song remains one of Focus' most accomplished pieces in terms of construction. This song continues the classical mood set in \"Delitae Musicae.\" While their previous extended works were largely jazz and blues jams, here we find a classically inspired and structured suite, which has a sense of purpose. It never becomes overbearing, and gives each member of the band room to show his talents. (The piece is actually based on a Haydn piece which they then extend and make their own, un-credited). The album closes with a reprise of \"Birth\", called \"Early Birth\" a fitting end, one can never get enough of Akkerman's tasteful yet electrifying guitar. Overall, this truly is a masterpiece, an album that flows beautifully, and maintains a relaxing mood while not becoming dull at all. Focus's best by far. Sadly, their work would take a nosedive after this ad Akkerman and Van Leer's relations would sour. - 5 Stars."

          "text": "Focus' finest hour by a pretty wide margin. The aimless jazz-wannabee noodling that made up the bulk of FOCUS III is only a memory here. This is Focus Concentrate-nothing inessential, only the good stuff.The band's interest in \"early music\" continues unabated, with Akkerman's lute piece \"Deliti\ufffd Music\ufffd\" opening the album, and also featuring the faux-liturgical pipe-organ tune \"La Cath\ufffddeale de Strasbourg\". \"Birth\" is the band at their soaring best, continuing in the line of the numbered \"Focus\" pieces stylistically. And \"Harem Scarem\" is a wacky little rocker, the progeny of \"Hocus Pocus\" most likely.But it's the title suite that's surely the highlight of the album, perhaps even the highlight of the band's entire career. With sub-sections whimsically named for the various cooking times of meat, the blend of classical and \"ancient\" sounds with rock textures and Akkerman's frequently jazzy guitar reached its apex here. The sound is wondrous, and you really get the feel of going on a musical journey.And best of all, no drum-solo bringing the piece to a grinding halt at any point! It's not too much to ask, really."

          "text": "It appears that I am in a small minority who think that this is not the best Focus album. Very good, certainly, but I'd prefer to listen to Moving Waves anyday though I'd concede that this is an improvement on Focus 3. The band had undergone a gradual change of rhythm section since Moving Waves, Burt Ruiter having first come in for Cyril Havermans and ex Stone the Crows Drummer Colin Allen then having taken over from Pierre van der Linden. But these two, good though they are, are only support for the astonishing talents of master keyboard player/flautist This van Leer and guitarist extraordinaire Jan Akkerman. Van Leer contributes what vocals there are, mostly yodels and sounds which fit the music well. The band has a strong classical influence throughout, as on the lute driven Delitae Musicae, but they can rock in thoroughly modern style when they want, as on Birth and the epic second side where great solos abound. The only track that stops this album getting 5 stars is La Cathedrale de Strasbourg, which I find rather dull despite van Leer's astonishing range of vocalisations. Harem Scarem is good and bears some resemblence to Hocus Pocus but falls a bit short of that track's brilliance. However, an essential album for any serious collection. (By the way, my vinyl LP (bought shortly after release) does not have Early Birth on it. This was found on a compilation album (Focus) released by Polydor in 1975. It is not good enough to be on Hamburger Concerto since it was a trial version of the track)"

          "text": "Focus has always been a band with sense of humor, not only for the strange sounds and yodeling emitted by Thijs Van Leer but also for the jokes they made of sacred cows.For example Hamburger Concerto is a play of words with Brandenburg Concerto by Johan Sebastian Bach (Not easy to find a bigger or more sacred cow anywhere), they work with the obvious Baroque influence in a delightful way just to make a Concert to..\"the hamburger\", something that only few and brave genius as Thijs Van Leer would ever dare to do.But that's not the only reference as we'll see later. The problem is that many people still see Focus as a comedy band or just buffoons, because sometimes their weird sense of humor so intelligent and subtle (Not in the name of the album because it's obvious) that most people don't get it, but nothing more far from reality, this humor enhances a rare and unique exquisite sound, very well crafted and linking several influences with such a skill and beauty that seems hard to believe.Lets start with Delitae Musicae, a rare inflection that resembles Latin or Medieval Italian (Not sure which one though or if it means delicate music or delicate whisper -Musitae....Musitar...to whisper-), in a reference to Claudio Monteverdi's: Madrigals, Book 1 delitae musicae, a name that describes perfectly this short introduction to Focus world in any of both senses because it's delicate music and at the same time a delicate whisper.Delitae Musicae, is reminiscent of the late Mediaeval/early Renaissance using harps and some instruments from the 1500's or 1600's (Lute and harpsichord if I'm not wrong even when the first one is not credited) delicate and wonderful, as a travel in time.Harem Scarem is a name that has tortured me for decades, can't find a right translation or what they meant, of course the extreme shouts and yodeling by Thijs give an idea of fear (Scare or maybe scream), a very Rock oriented track, frantic and breathtaking from start to end.La Cath\ufffddral De Strasbourg as Thijs said in the DVD Masters from the Vault, is dedicated to the magnificent Gothic construction and the vivid image left in him for life, the track starts soft, dark, in other words Gothic and majestic at the same time, if you haven't seen a picture of the building or better been there, you can't really understand how perfect is the musical description, but then after a soft (and unusual) lyrics and whistle section the song turns towards a more jazzy sound, incredibly beautiful track, one of my favorites.Birth is a unique song, the brilliant harpsichord introduction by Thijs is simply delightful, but a surprising drumming by Collin Allen (Who replaced Pierre Van Der Linden) changes the atmosphere of the song returning us to the classical Focus sound even when a bit stronger and more Hard Rock oriented than ever before, another outstanding piece of art that reminds me at some points of Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull.It's now time for the feast, the central piece of the work, the self titled epic Hamburger Concerto, I almost fell to the floor in laughter when I read the name of the parts of this epic (Starter, Rare, Medium I, Medium II, Well Done and One for the Road) simply hilarious to blend Johan Sebastian Bach with Burgers King or Mc' Donald's.But the music is no joke, simply wonderful 20:19 minutes of pure Progressive Rock, incredible mixtures of styles and genres that go from pure Baroque to the Dutch version of Flamenco (The Flanders region or nation went from Spain to France The Netherlands and part of Belgium, what explains the electric Flamenco style of Jan Akkerman and the use of such instruments as castanets or even hand clapping) with incredible Religious Choral sections and explosions of pure power, so well developed that I won't even dare to attempt to describe, because words are too cheap for the beauty and complexity of this epic, even Mr. Van Leer's usual vocal jokes contribute in this case to make the atmosphere perfect and to enhance the beauty of the music.Just believe me, those who haven't heard this song will never imagine what Focus means and I can only describe this song in one word: PERFECT.Early Birth is another strange song, sadly people often impressed by the previous epic tend to repeat it over and over and forget this small gem at the end of the CD and almost never played, and I say gem because if one track describes how Focus used to sound before this album is Early Birth, leaves me hoping it would last at least 5 minutes and with the honey in the lips.Listening to it carefully seems that it has been cut due to the limitations of the vinyl format because it's abrupt as if some engineer would have shouted We're running out of time and someone just lowered the volume in a forced way (As we used to do in our homes when a cassette tape was running out of space), the only flaw in the album, but so insignificant that I don't care.Rating, 5 stars not a single doubt, if there were 6 or 7 stars possible I would keep going higher.If you don't own this album, you don't know Focus, and that is a shame and a pity for any proghead, run to the store and get a copy."

At first I tried to listen to the huge \"Hamburger Concerto\" track by parts just to try to get a glance from it, but that was not enough to get a good idea. You really have to put the song and listen from beginning to the end. And, oh my god, only for the last 3 minutes of this track I could die while listening... The end of Hamburger Concerto is simply the best musical climax ever achieved in music yet (from my experience). It has the power of the best Camel climax but is more powerful! If the whole album was as powerful as the end of that song, I would give 5/5 on this album without hesitating. However, as good as it is, 4. 6/5.0 is a better overall score.Higly recommanded if you like to sit there and listen to music that will take you far away... and blow you away at the same time!"

They work seriously on their arrangements, and in this disc they managed to create a barroque scenary mixed with some rocking moments. At first this may scream \"inconsistent\", but it actually worked perfectly, and the album's flow is never interrupted.\"Delitia Musicale\" and \"Cathedrale\" bring to your mind an epic feel, you have dreams of travelling to those ancient romantic times, but soon a rocker \"Harem Scarem\" (a good example of how not to overuse a formula - i'm talking about the funny vocals, which are wisely used here) and a happy \"Birth\" wake you up and realise that the real dream is to come...the title suite. Overlong? Maybe, but they do progress the song with very beautiful melodies and it features the record's funniest moment, the second vocal craziness. An embryo version of \"Birth\" concludes the experience and it takes the best parts of the longer version of it.Some people say this is FOCUS' finest work. I can't say that because i never listened to any other disc by them, but i am sure that Hamburger Concerto is a very creative work which the band would find trouble to top. Anyway, it is not a masterpiece but it is absolutely essential since it shows an unique side of prog music."

          "text": "This almost completely instrumental album (with the sole exception of a couple of tracks containing some singing by the inimitable Thijs Van Leer) is widely held to be Dutch band Focus's finest hour, as well as one of the masterpieces of the Symphonic subgenre. The musicianship on show is indeed dazzling, with Focus boasting one of the most accomplished guitarists in rock (although far too often forgotten by all but true connoisseurs), the brilliant Jan Akkerman . Moreover (and that's good news in a genre too often characterised as unnecessarily dour and self-important), Focus are also possessed of a remarkable sense of humour, as demonstrated by the album title itself - an ironic take on Bach's \"Brandenburger Concerto\", one of the monuments of classical music. Van Leer's celebrated yodeling adds entertainment value to a record which is otherwise a textbook example of how to write real symphonic prog.The album's six tracks run the gamut from the short, lute-based medieval fantasy that is \"Delitae Musicae\", to the lively, rollicking \"Harem Scarem\", powered by a strong rythm section playing a memorable riff, to the wistful, atmospheric \"La Cath\ufffddrale de Strasbourg\", a showcase for Thijs Van Leer's skills as a pianist (he also sings some vocals in French, adding to the melancholy feel of the piece). The intricate \"Birth\", starting out slowly with a lovely harpsichord intro, then picking up speed and allowing Van Leer to shine as a flutist as well as a keyboardist, introduces the album's centrepiece and title-track, the 20-minute-plus suite \"Hamburger Concerto\" with its funnily-named six movements.In this monumental track, Focus prove (if it ever was needed) that they are in no way inferior to the better-known British prog giants of the era. The interplay between the band's two stars, Akkerman and Van Leer, is nothing short of spectacular. The influences of European classical and medieval music, jazz and folk blend seamlessly to create a composition which stands proud with the best epics of the same period - though, if one wanted to nitpick, it could be said it suffers from the absence of a coherent vocal line, unlike, for instance, ELP's \"Tarkus\" (there is some singing, apparently in Dutch, but it sounds a bit like an afterthought). Akkerman's guitar shows the influence of flamenco, one of the fundamental styles for guitarists; while Van Leer goes to town with some superb organ and synth playing, reminding listeners that there is life beyond Emerson and Wakeman. \"Early Birth\" closes the album, reprising the theme of \"Birth\" in a softer, more restrained way.An undisputed landmark of Symphonic Prog, \"Hamburger Concerto\" is that rare album which blends amazing musicianship, inventiveness, melody and humour in a coherent whole. It may take more than one listen to fully appreciate it, but the experience will ultimately be more than rewarding. A well-deserved 4.5 stars."

It was the Dutch, not the English, who capitalized on the sweet fruits of symphonic prog. Hamburger Concerto is a lively and unforgettable experience.It should be of note that this is one of the few \"jovial\" albums I truly love and enjoy. It's full of spirit, full of life, and hits at the musical center of the brain like few albums do. It's important to note that none of the encompassing tracks to the main \"epic\" are filler. They are all unique and very moving tracks themselves in their own way. Harem Scarem is of particular note due its jubilant nature. There's influences here across the spectrum of prog as well, some imitations of the \"big giants\" if you will, but never sacrificing their own identity.I generally am not a fan of much of the work of early prog giants, finding it too commercial to a degree and often too great a range in quality from one section to the next. Hamburger Concerto is one of the few albums that I enjoy from start to finish, and while nothing is particularly shocking or mesmerizing, the artistic grace it stands with is some of the best in the history of all of prog, and a supreme achievement of these underrated Dutchmen. Let's bring on the burgers; this is an amazing piece of music."

          "text": "Yet another masterpiece in the Focus catalogue, \"hamburger Concerto\" finds the band exploring their own symphonic trend a bit deeper while maintaining a strong flavor of jazzy vibe in their music. Pierre van der Linden's departure from the drummer's seat was indeed a serious factor that the band had to lead with, but fortunately, Colin Allen not only provided a solid foundation for the rockier orientation that the band was pursuing by then, but he also included some touches of Van der Linden dynamics into his own playing. Completeing the rhythm duo, Ruiter did a great job at completing the refurbished foundation upon which the musical ideas could be developed in a powerful manner. Yes, at this moment, Focus was reinforcing their progressive essence and preparing to rock a bit further than they had done so far: you can tell by the rough sound production for the lead guitar and Hammond organ inputs that Focus was willing to sound tighter. Another very noticeable aspect is the use of heavily overdubbed keyboards: along with the almost ever present Hammond, Van Leer put a lot of effort at integrating the mellotron and the ARP synthesizer in many of the most gradiose passages of the album, in this way creating a genuine orchestral atmosphere for the overall sound. Having said that, the album kicks off with a gentle, brief piece on lute and recorder, adapted from the Early Renaissance. After that, 'Harem Scarem' brings a strong reminder of the old combination of rocking energy and light humor that a couple of years ago had worked so well in 'Hocus Pocus'. It works here very well, too: rock'n'roll mixed with bucolic shades of flute and accordion, and also some weird percussive adornments on tympani. 'La Cathedrale de Strasbourg' brings a different mood, an etheral exercise on sweet melancholy originated from a few piano chords that build the subtle main motif. The gentle lead guitar washes fill some of the remaining empty spaces while the rhythm section provides an adequately subdued jazzy vibe to the track. 'Birth' has to be one of the definitive finest compositions by Akkerman in the history of Focus. Full of beautiful motifs linked fluidly by tight arrangements, it kicks off with an amazing harpsichord intro, and then it is developed on the basis of the alternating interaction between flute and lead guitar. Akkerman's last solo is simply magnificent. So far, so good for the album's first half. But the second half is really nothing to be dismissed, since it is occupied by the namesake 20 minute suite, a monster piece in which borrowed Baroque themes and archetypical rock riffs marry in a well-ordained amalgam of splendor and strength. Particular peaks of this suite are:the successive yodelling-organ-flute by Van Leer in 'Medium I'; the subtle tension between the guitar solo and the rhythm duo in 'Medium II'; the ellaboration of the symphonic climax all the way through 'Well Done' until the high-spirited coda 'One for the Road'. A great ending for a magnificent progressive gem: Focus showed with \"Hamburger Concerto\" that they were still on the top of their creative energy."

          "text": "3.6 StarsIt's difficult to resist trying an album called \"Hamburger Concerto\" with its title track taking twenty minutes and divided into sections humorously called \"starter\" \"well-done\". Have you ever heard a song about food, let alone a progressive rock epic? I didn't and I wanted to try something new, and expected something hilarious since I knew Focus by their funny and quirky single with yodeling and whistle solos. Unfortunately, I couldn't find humor here (it really sounds more serious than I expected), but that doesn't change the fact that the music is great and very melodic.Hamburger Concerto is not your typical symphonic rock music, and it has a very classical and romantic feel and is generally instrumental. This is evident in \"La Cathedral de Strasbourg\", which sounds like it comes from another century if it wasn't for the jazz guitar playing near the end. Check the whistling halfway through the track: very interesting and not out of place. The harpsichord of \"Birth\" still brings back the old classical sound but when you expect more of that style, the song turns into a delicious rock tune full of tasty Hammond organs (yes, I can use those adjectives, Come on, the cover is a hamburger!). I love the usage of the flute in this track; it is even more effective than on the short, delicate \"Delicate Musicae\" which opens the album. Overall, Birth has to be the best Focus song I've heard so far. It's full of melody, emotion, and is flawlessly executed. At the end of the album, a second part of the magnificent \"Birth\" is played and is a great way to finish the album.Hamburger Concerto is the centerpiece of the album. I was expected to laugh a lot, but this song doesn't really sound like cooking a burger. It's a very well done (no pun intended) classical soft-rock song that sounds surprisingly honest and unpretentious. The music is generally mid-tempo and pleasant to listen to, with wonderful melodies and arrangements that would make our classical music heroes proud. There is absolutely no showing off nor pointless soloing here, and I'm glad there isn't because it would break the atmosphere of this tune. The song ends with an extended majestic section with a nice and simple synthesizer solo. The only thing that makes this song not stand on the level of the epic masterpieces like Tarkus, Close to the Edge, and Supper's Ready is the fact that it's twenty minutes of mid-tempo music. Sure, it's great music all the way through, but lack of dynamics for such a long time hurts the song eventually. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of mid-tempo classical music, you are likely to fall in love with this piece.Wait! This sounds like a 4-star review, so why did you give 3.6 stars?! Clear, \"Harem Scarem\" is embarrassing. The guys tried to be funny and reproduce their famous \"Hocus Pocus\". They failed, the forced vocalizations sound idiotic and the rock & roll music is very dumb, overlong, and repetitive.This great album is highly recommended to fans of classical music and the softer side of progressive rock Just skip Harem Crapem and have a chance to hear Focus at their best. However, if you like your music to have guitar players playing 40 note/second solos, 10-minute long keyboard solos, and find classical music a bore, this album may not be for you.1_Delicate Musicae (B)2_Harem Scarem (D-)3_La Cathedral de Strasbourg (B-)4_Birth (A)5_Hamburger Concerto (A/B)6_Early Birth (B+)"

Light music for this moderately appreciate track. The contrast with \"Herem Scarem\" is abrupt, to say the least. This one rocks like hell and its struture reminds me of \"Hocus\" except that there is no yodeling here.One of the highlight of this album is \"La Cath\ufffddrale De Strasbourg\". Fully symphonic, this song works crescendo. Almost classical during the intro, it features very nice vocal harmonies and subtle piano play. Superb whistling as well (although I am not a devote fan of this exercise). The whole track is really a prog gem : pure beauty.The start of \"Birth\" reminds me \"Rain & Tears\" (Aphrodite's Child). This instrumental track is well in the \"Focus\" tradition. Catchy guitar and flute are the mix. And it works perfectly well. Another beautiful Focus moment.The epic and title song \"Hamburger Concerto\" is a brilliant symphony. Or a rock-opera. Whatever you like. Some classical themes brought back to live and \"Focus-iced\" in a fantastic manner. Lots of keyboards but maybe not enough guitar during this excellent prog masterpiece. Some vocals in Dutch around minute fifteen are fortunately very short. This is the only weaker part; but after this \"Focus\" delivers a great finale full of synthesizers. Extremely solid.And please, don't forget the good \"Early Bird\". It closes this magnificent album with brilliance at times.As far as the rating is concerned, it is not really difficult. There are very few albums on this site which are so much praised as this one. Exclusively four or five star ratings (except one) if you take only the ones with comments ! Mine will be at the highest end.This is how \"Focus\" sound when they decide to stick to the symphonic prog genre. Gone with the jazzy influences and those useless improvisations.A \"chef-d'oeuvre.

When I first saw the title, I thought that Focus was going to present some pompous, overblown, rediculous piece of prog. Fortunately, what I got was one of my top 25 albums of all time. Here are the highlights (though the entire album is a highlight in my book):Harem Scarem. One of those goofy Focus songs that may or may not work. In this case, it does. It reminds me of a 70s dance-off, but it moves around enough and has sufficient musicianship to move past being simply worth of some foot-tapping.La Cathedrale de Strasbourg. This tune really makes me want to visit the city of Strausbourg. The tasteful instrumentation is prominent: haunting piano, striking church organ, a lazy whistle, beautiful vocal harmonies, and of course excellent guitar.Birth. Just another example of a new surprise waiting behind every corner on this album. Harpsichord leads into a very funky (and catchy!) groove, and we're all set for the great melodies and instrumentals that await. The guitar, flute and drums are especially well-done here.Hamburger Concerto. One of these epics that won't kick you in the butt, but the Concerto will always deliver when you need to sit down and appreciate some great music. Here's the VERY brief synopsis: a tasteful classical intro builds into a very nice melodic refrain, then slows down for a groovy section featuring a killer guitar solo, followed by a brief church-choir-esque section, perfectly setting up the EPIC grand finale. This is simply the best that Focus has to offer, and the diversity is impressive and staggering.The final word is that everything on this album is well-done and enjoyable. The varied instrumentation never overshadows the music that it is embedded in, and here Focus never attempt to be too \"proggy\" (the main reason why this gets five stars and PFM's Per Un Amico only gets four). Get yourself a Hamburger Concerto and enjoy (even for vegetarians!)."

          "text": "Here is, in my opinion, the strongest album by this dutch progressive rock band. This is quite some complicated music here, however, it's pretty goofy at times too. It consists of mostly lengthy tracks void of any singing (except for the yodeling at times) and they makes use of a lot of instruments not typically found in rock music. There is a lute and a flute on the opening track which gives off a very medieval sound.The music is quite varied offering a wide range of styles and moods. Every member contributes greatly to the final sound offering a blend of organ, piano, mellotron, flute, accordion and of course electric guitar, bass, and drums.\"Birth\"even makes use of a harpsichord (and it's a great song too). Of course the bulk of the album is consumed by the epic instrumental title track. The band pulls out every trick in the book on this album, which makes for a very interesting listen."

          "text": "Hamburger Concerto is the peak of FOCUS' career and one of the best examples of what progressive rock really is, in its most narrow meaning.From the acoustic, Rennaissance-tinged Delitae Musicae, through the reprise of the main melody theme of Early Birth, this album presents a sincere and creative musical performance that is rarely matched during the era. It is perfectly cohesive effort with musical passages flowing easily from one part to another. It is not easy to make a 45 minutes of largely instrumental music without forcing a listener to skip certain parts or to go away for a cup of coffee while waiting for interesting moments to come. And that is what frequently happenned to many (prog) rock artists who lost compass and ideas about where to go.FOCUS recorded a wonderful album that mixes classical symphonic, jazz and rock elements in such a way that many overrated bands like ELP or even YES in some parts of their career had difficulty to accomplish. There is a lot of symphonic- like movements and changes of tempo and mood. Loads of keyboards (organ, piano, mellotron, harpsichord, synths), flute, lead guitars and more than a competent new rhythm section are played and produced in a magnificent way.The only minor critique from my side would go to Harem Scarem, because it was obviously made to sound like a continuation of extremely popular Hocus Pocus from Moving Waves album, this time with powerful piano riff. Add to this unoriginality an extremely unnecessary yea, yea, yea... vocals and you get the weakest moment of the album. Even as such, it is by no means a bad song - it is just unappropriate. Still, it cannot spoil the overall quality of this prog masterpiece!PERSONAL RATING: 4,5/5P.A. RATING: 5/5"

          "text": "While this is most peoples favourite FOCUS record, I think \"Moving Waves\" and \"III\" are much better. You have to love the humour they bring into their music though, I mean check out the title of this album.\"Delitae Musicae\" is a short intro track of acoustic guitar and piano. \"Harem Scarem\" features a catchy rhythm and is uptempo. I really like the guitar 2 minutes in followed by flute. That same theme is back at 3 1/2 minutes only this time with an extended guitar solo. Back to the uptempo melody after 5 minutes. \"La Cathedral De Strasbourg\" opens with dark sounding piano, and when the organ comes in it reminds me of GENESIS. Vocals after 2 minutes. Some whistling and a very pleasant melody that reminds me of CAMEL.\"Birth\" opens with harpsichord before drums take over a minute in. Organ follows as we get a full sound before 2 minutes. Flute a minute later as it calms down.The guitar 5 minutes in is tastefully played but it comes back before 7 minutes more aggressively. \"Hamburger Concerto\" is a 20 minute ride. I like the contrast early of the rock sound with the Banks-like keys. Excellent. A calm 5 1/2 minutes in as an odd vocal melody arrives. The song sort of meanders along for a while. I'm not a fan of the vocals before 16 minutes, they remind me of church. A change to a fuller sound 17 minutes in as earlier themes are repeated. \"Early Birth\" is a catchy little track with some great guitar after a minute, and later to end it.Good album but I much prefer \"Moving Waves\" and \"Focus III\"."

          "text": "Probably the last great album done by dutch prog legend Focus. By this time the music has changed quite a lot, and the rifts between founder members and songwriters This Van Leer and Jan Akkerman didn\ufffdt help matters. Still they could produce fine music together. English drummer Colin Allen steps in and has a very different style from Pierre Van Der Linden, more funky and down to earth. He worked well with bassist Bert Ruiter. The use of diverse percussion was also a novelty and added some colours to the overall sound.The side long opus hamburger Concerto is usually cited as the highlight, but I think this is a very balanced CD and I liked all the tracks. It\ufffds interesting to see the band experimenting with some more \ufffdheavier\ufffdsounds like in Harem Scarem (it works very well after the short opener, which was played only with lute and recorder), but the best track to me is Birth: beautiful harpsichord opening, then comes bass and drums, and finally some of Akkerman\ufffds best guitar solos ever, while the flute interventions are also amazing. I remeber going over and over to this song since I first heard it and I think it\ufffds a pity that it is not so well known. To me is another classic like Hocus Pocus or Sylvia. My CD version has a bonus track called Early Birth, that is obviously an embrionic version of Birth. Nice addition for the hardcore fan or collector, but it is not as good as the other tunes.In the same league as the more famous Moving Waves and Focus 3, it is one of the most interesting and unique instrumental prog albums of the 70\ufffds. Highly recommended."

          "text": "Many people have posted their opinions about this album with excellent rating. I do agree in most of them and I just want to add that this album was different in style with any other legendary albums from other bands like Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, Van der Graaf or ELP. In fact, this album made the kinds of 70s progressive rock music comprehensive. Yes, you might claim that Focus used flute as Jethro Tull did with \"Thick as A Brick\" or \"A Passion Play\" or \"Aqualung\". But, these two bands and any album from these two bands were totally in different vein. Focus is pretty much a combination of classical music, jazz and rock. \"Hamburger Concerto\" blends all of the influences nicely.When this album was released I was not really \"into\" this kind of music offering as I was inclined to observe Genesis, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin. The reason was probably simple: Focus did not offer vocal and to me (by that time) rock music without vocal was not quite attractive. But as I spun much of those bands with vocals there was time when I wanted to enjoy music in itself without lyrical verse. So I did try Return To Forever, Focus, etc. One thing that caught me was Focus 3 as it had eerie and evocative flute work combined by brilliant, ambient keyboard work. But later I found \"Hamburger Concerto\" (the track) was inspiring. The song contains great movement from one segment to another. It then became my regular play along with Focus 3. As time went by I found other tracks like \"Birth\" was interesting also. AT the end, when there was CD era, I upgraded my collection from cassette to CD. I then find joy in enjoying the whole stream of this \"Hamburger Concerto\" (hey, I like the name!) album. I found that \"Delitae Musicae\" (1:13) was an excellent acoustic work followed nicely by \"Harem Scarem\" (5:52) and \"La Cath\ufffddral De Strasbourg\" (4:59).Overall, this is a tight composition album and it's an excellent addition to any progressive music collection. If you want to have a comprehemsive understanding on the roots of 70s prog music, this album is a MUST have. Highly recommended. Keep on proggin' ..!Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW (i-Rock!

          "text": "In my opinion this is not the best record Focus had to offer. I put on that position the much maligned Focus III. Still , Hamburger Concerto is one of the best symphonic albums out there and certanly the best example of how a rock band could reproduce classical music. I was quite surprised of how much instruments they have used on this record specially by Thijs Van Leer. At that time former drummer Pierre Van der Linden was replaced by Collin Allen. Personally I like Van der Linden jazzier approach more and I think Colin's drums sound too loud on the mix.This record opens with a little classical tune in the vein of former Focus compositions ( Elspeth of Nothingham comes to mind) named Delittle Musicae. Certanly a good prelude of what's to come on this record. Harem Scarem is a uptempo prog rock tune much in the vein of Hocus Pocus. Although I find some really incredible Akkerman solos and I like Thij's performance here ( weird voices and accordion included) , I find Hocus Pocus to be slightly better. Next comes one of the highlights of the record , the one and only \" Cathedrale de Strasbourg\" This guys managed to reproduce quite a melancholic feel here and Thij's french vocals seem to place me right in front of the cathedral on a rainy day. Sorry about that but this song always pops us this picture on my mind. Suddenly after one of the best WHISTLING! Solos I have heard the song changes into a jazzy section closing with a church-like singing by Thijs. Truly beautiful. The next one is a classical rework called \"Birth\" based on Thij's flute playing skills and Akkerman's chops.Of course , the title track is the core of the record: An epic 20 minute composition that can hold up well against some of the classics. Thij's use of hapsicord gives this epic some kind of medieval or even academic music feeling. I think I am emphasizing much of his work in my review , but I can't help myself since I think this guy is one of the best musicians within progressive music. Jan Akkerman's guitarwork is nothing short of spectacular as well. Back on track , the only flaw I can find on this composition is that due to a particular Akkerman riff ( you 'll notice which one) this song always feels like it's ending. But otherwise \" Hamburguer Concerto\" is a majestic tune that serves as a vehicle to show how diverse and accomplished musicians those dutchmen were. Finally to close this record a rework of the \" Birth\" theme only this time much shorter and flute-based. I think this little tune fulfills the objective of losing this album with grandeur , specially because of Jan's guitar solo at the very end.If you are looking for virtuoso multi- instrumentalists playing music that resembles a symphonic orchestra , then you can't miss \" Hamburger Concerto\". A true SYMPHONIC ROCK album if there was any."

          "text": "I have never cared for Focus to be honest. Overall, I find their work bland and uninteresting. This highly acclaimed album is no exception, but it is decent and for the most part enjoyable.\"Delicate Musicae\" A delicate baroque-sounding introduction begins the album.\"Harem Scarem\" Closer to the boogie-rock of Uriah Heep, as even the screeching vocals are present in the background, this work tends to be irritating. Things soften up in places, courtesy of accordion and other instrumentation. The guitar playing is good, if a bit brittle sounding. Bert Ruiter's fluid bass exercises make the piece.\"La Cath\ufffddral de Strasbourg\" This is not a rock track, at least not at first, but piano and organ with passages that range from gentle to haunting. Quiet drums and simple chords pave the way for some vocals and really muffled guitar. It's a fairly sedated piece that doesn't do much for me. The last part is substandard-sounding jazz music.\"Birth\" The baroque feel returns as a harpsichord introduces the song. It takes on a more primitive feel with low organ and pounding toms. As instrumentals go, this keeps my interest. The flute work may be easily overshadowed by greats like Ian Anderson, but it is still very good and a pleasing touch overall. The guitar sounds fuller, and the playing is exceptional. While the chord progressions are nothing terribly creative, the overall arrangement is respectable.\"Hamburger Concerto\" Strong organ work (although perhaps second rate to other giants of the time like Keith Emerson or Rick Wakeman) begins the epic piece. The first five minutes alternate a simple heavier riff with various orchestral pieces. The vocalizations and the yodeling, whatever their purpose or intent, all but ruin the music for me Following this, there is a very fluid passage with some great organ again. The electric guitar sound is inventive for this sort of piece, and works well in the more delicate passages. The guitar solo is lengthy and I tend to lose interest after several measures.\"Early Birth\" The album concludes with a dull piece that has some slight disco sensibilities in the beginning. It mainly consists of woodwind work over the same exact chord progression featured in \"Birth.\" For the most part, this is pointless and adds nothing."

          "text": "I'm not very knowledgeable about this band. You might say I'm somewhat out of focus. (Sorry, couldn't help myself.) But a lot of folks whose opinions I respect think rather highly of them and I figured it was long past time for me to get more familiar with their music. To be brutally honest, other than harboring fond memories of the mind-bending, yodelistic stylings of their radio staple \"Hocus Pocus\" that sat prettily in FM's heavy rotation in the mid 70s and a dubious wild night I had in Denver that involved one of the sides of their album \"Moving Waves\" playing on eternal repeat on a lithe and willing sirens' turntable (a sobering tale of youthful debauchery that I elect to forgo telling for now), I'm but a neophyte guppy when it comes to these Dutch masters. Therefore when I spotted \"Hamburger Concerto\" taking up space in some used record bins recently I remembered that this platter is considered by many of their fans to be their best and decided to start my focused education at the top.Just to throw you off balance a tad they open with 1:12 of an air entitled \"Delitiae Musicae,\" an arrangement of a traditional song from days gone by (a fancy way of saying it's a tune so old that no one has a clue as to which caveman came up with it and, thusly, no royalties need be paid). Using classic acoustic instrumentation, it's nicely done but not at all representative of what's to follow. \"Harem Scarem\" is more like what I expected in that it's an upbeat rocker from front to back in which the piano and Hammond organ of Thijs Van Leer and the guitar of Jan Akkerman combine to create a light-hearted ditty that's fun to listen to. (I'm wondering why it didn't receive a lot more airplay since it seems to be borne of the same cloth that made \"Hocus Pocus\" such a monster hit but perhaps it was due to a lack of grease-the-program-director's-palm-with-payola-and/or-nose-candy being supplied by the PR pukes at the label.) It's a happy-go-lucky boogie-woogie song that flies in the same stratosphere as Traffic's smile-inducing \"Glad\" does but it distinguishes itself with a more involved and complex structure. The funky breakdown just past the halfway point gives bassist Bert Ruiter a chance to stand in the spotlight and he doesn't shy away from making the most of his opportunity.The album's apex comes in the form of \"La Cathedrale De Strasbourg.\" The number begins with a flurry of dramatic piano stylings ala Chopin that lead to a delicate melody performed in a duet with Jan's guitar. In the 2nd part of the piece the group adopts a slow, bluesy groove whilst Thijs breaks into a brilliant whistling foray that would make a Texas mockingbird jealous. It's a cool surprise and Akkerman's jazzy guitar solo that follows is impressive. Overall it's a well-composed, moody instrumental that takes the listener through several different musical textures and emotions with ease. I can't say the same for the labored \"Birth,\" however. It starts out with promising harpsichord trills but when drummer Colin Allen rambles in with his floor toms a 'rolling the unremarkable main theme emerges and the track enters the dreaded realm of the mediocre. There's a nifty flute ride (and later on a spirited recorder spasm) that pleases the Tull fan in me but Jan's sloppy guitar phrases leave me cold. I realize that this tune might have been the bee's knees in '74 but the decades haven't been kind to this cut and now it's as dated as a paisley Nehru jacket.The LP's six-movement namesake and claim to fame is, obviously, the side- long \"Hamburger Concerto.\" While unfortunate moments of inconsistency and hum-drum plague this opus there are enough spots of genuine euphoria erupting to rescue it from the dregs. \"Starter\" possesses the kind of grandiose and stately attitude that I like to hear and Bert's intricate bass lines distinguish themselves in particular. It's big and proggy as all get out. Perfect. Don't change a thing. \"Rare\" is a continuation of that processional aura but it does belie a tuft of gray hair poking out from under the tiara (Careful with that ARP, Eugene!) in that the synthesizer is as thin and buzzy as a gnat's aria. Yet a large- scale intervention from the mighty Mellotron saves the day. \"Medium I\" (get the bun pun yet?) features some clever vocal hijinks from Van Leer that keep things from getting too heavy-handed/serious (always a good thing, their sense of humor being one of their more endearing traits) and when he mounts the Hammond organ and drives it like a dirt bike for a spell he demonstrates that Wakeman and Emerson ain't got nothin' on him. Thijs also ends this segment with some swirling, tasty flute roll-ups that will tickle your eardrums.On \"Medium II\" it's the guitar's turn to shine from center stage but it seems there's a short in the floodlights. Jan's jazzy noodling at first is intriguing but when he dials up the volume/distortion his tone becomes brittle and it sounds like he's searching desperately for places to take his solo. To add insult to injury he's not helped in the least by the tired descending chord progression that's droning underneath him. It's intolerably unimaginative and entirely too been-there-a-zillion-times patronizing. I understand that it's intended to be a simple platform for Akkerman to shock and awe atop of on the fretboard but he fails to do so and it becomes no better than a flabby Lynyrd Skynyrd-like jam that can't end too soon. What I'm saying is that if a guitarist is going to fill up 5 minutes of vinyl he'd better tear the roof off the sucker or it's just filler. Enough already! He finally plugs his cord into the Leslie speaker cabinet and switches to a friendlier riff to pull this bus out of the ditch. \"Well Done\" takes us into a stained-glass sanctuary for a large dose of Catholic mass-ish chantings before a heavy rock motif ensues and things get back to being both entertaining and challenging. \"One For the Road\" is the finale and it doesn't back away from being delightfully over-the-top. Glad to hear it. They construct a fittingly colossal wall of sound accentuated by a fatter ARP synthesizer setting and the mountainous climax is stupendous and gratifying. You know, the kind of stuff that drove punk rockers to stick safety pins through their cheeks.While Focus may not occupy the penthouse suites in the prog rock condominiums that house the likes of Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis they do reside comfortably in the same high-rise and there's a lot to be said for that. They were extremely talented, to be sure, but they weren't necessarily innovative and that's the essential characteristic that separates them from the giants. \"Hamburger Concerto\" is a pleasant listening experience that affords a clear look into precisely what was going on in the mid 70s in commercial prog rock and it deserves my highest 3-star rating. Enjoy it for what it is but don't expect too much."

          "text": "Focus' 'Hamburger Concerto' is the most artistic album of the band. More serene, focused on a classy and adult interpretation of the bands influences; classical music, folk, fusion and (hard)rock. The band sounds more tightly arranged and recorded, which does result in a slightly less wild sound - though still blessed with quite a lot of enthusiasm. Perhaps the difference between this album and Focus' earlier efforts is actually a bit like the difference between Camel's 'Mirage' and 'Moodmadness'. 'La Cathedrale De Strasbourg' with its distinct dreamy atmosphere is arguably the most beautiful piece the band ever recorded. The title song is an epic symphonic prog track with many beautiful sections and one of Akkerman's best guitar solo's. A classic of the genre. However great this album is, I must admit it never really 'clicked' with me as much as some other Focus records have; most notably 'Moving Waves' and 'Ship of Memories'. I guess I'm more drawn toward the wild enthusiasm of the years before than to this very mature and soulful 'Hamburger Concerto'."

          "text": "Naming your album HAMBURGER CONCERTO most likely means you don't take your music too seriously. Stranger enough, the music here sounds like it was created by four dedicated, serious musos with tastes for jazz and classical musics. Get ready for a dizzying array of bluesy guitar things, Hammond drives and classical sensibilities.I've heard only MOVING WAVES before this, and while there isn't a standout track like ''Hocus Pocus'', HAMBURGER CONCERTO is much better on the consistency end of things. It's like biting into a perfect burger that's juicy and tasty with eat bite (apologies to all the vegetarians on this site). Focus really find their stride here and deliver series after series of top notch instrumental performances, save for one problem.It all starts with a brief introduction followed by the uptempo, high-octane ''Harem Scarem'' that tries to repeat the success of ''Hocus Pocus''. While it's more musically engaging, they managed to rip off Miles Davis's ''It's About That Time'' (from IN A SILENT WAY) somewhere in the middle. They manage to make up for this error on the sometimes jazzy, sometimes Medieval ''La Cathedral...'' and the partially heavy, bass chord driven ''Birth''.MOVING WAVES has an epic in ''Eruption'' that at best, is very inconsistent in delivery as too many ideas are shoved into the piece and way too many soft and dry spots are there. ''Hamburger Concerto'' seems to fix these problems making a great epic throughout the twenty minute duration. Best of all for my tastes, they only play around with a few themes and extend them properly. Thijs van Leer even offers a few goofy vocals for kicks.Not really the best album from the symphonic prog parts, but definitely one of the most enjoyable."

I've always though that this was a live album, mainly due to its title, but that doesn't mean that I now like it any less.Hamburger Concertoranks among the band's top albums, although I wouldn't exactly place it on the top of my list. The main appeal here is the record's consistency where every new track adds something new to the overall style without tramping the same ground twice.The biggest highlight moment for me is the intro toHarem Scaremthat always gets my pulse going. It's true that the song was clearly designed to be a new stab at the success that was generated byHocus Pocus. Unfortunately the lightning wouldn't strike twice for Focus but at least this track is just as exciting and even more so! The rest of the music onHamburger Concertoprogress in a similar fashion as onMoving Waves. Some might look at the two album's track listings and see very clear similarities between the two, although the biggest difference is that, by this time, Focus was a much more experienced band.Birthis the second biggest highlight for me here. The groovy progression of the track is excellent and I often compare it's placement on the album with that ofFocus IIon the band's second album, making it an unofficial addition to the series. Still, it's the album's title tracks that makes or breaks the overall opinion of this album for me. Even though it might seem like a new stab at a lengthy composition likeEruption, which is not helped by the fact that both tracks have short yodeling moments that remind me strongly ofHocus Pocus.Hamburger Concertois actually much more structured composition-wise. There are clear themes highlighted all throughout the track and the instrumental arrangements are top notch. Still, this performance has never been one of my favorites. It's a great achievement for Focus but cannot really match any of the other epics from that same era.Hamburger Concertowas unfortunately enough the last great album by Focus and closes this chapter of the Dutch Symphonic Prog with a bang. I highly recommend this album to any serious fans of the '70s Symphonic Prog movement, even though it's not a huge favorite of mine.***** star songs: Harem Scarem (5:52) Birth (7:46)**** star songs: Delitae Musicae (1:13) La Cath\ufffddral De Strasbourg (4:59) Hamburger Concerto (20:19) Early Birth (2:54)"

While I would most often play Side 2-- the one containing the concerto--\"La Cath\ufffddrale de Strasbourg\" remains one of my favorite all-time prog songs. (Partly because I lived in Strasbourg, France, 1978-79, but more for the beautifully refined and respectful ministrations of vocal, flute, and guitar entwined therein.) While \"Harem Scarem\" (9/10; a kind of \"Hocus Pocus\" reprise) and \"Birth\" (9/10) are good, solid songs, FOCUS, for me, excelled when they brought the old, 'ancient and medieval' sounds or the quirky odd sounds into their music rather than performed straightforward rock. Still, this is the best all-around record of a, IMHO, notoriously underachieving band (think of the potential they had with the likes of Ruiter, van Der LInden, van Leer, and Akkerman on board!). Though really 4.5 stars, it is one of those masterful milestones of progressive rock that one cannot but hold up high for others to try."

          "text": "Never mind the knee-slapping novelty hit \"Hocus Pocus\"; the true range of the Dutch band Focus can be heard on their 1974 album \"Hamburger Concerto\". Of all their studio recordings it's easily the strongest and best sounding, from the delicate 73-second medieval prologue \"Delitae Musicae\" to the shuddering climax of the 20-plus minute title track, filling all of Side Two on the original LP.But the energetic album opener probably should have been named something else besides \"Harem Scarem\". The title is too obviously a self-conscious echo of \"Hocus Pocus\", and the music, though undeniably solid, clearly wants to recapture some of the crazy magic of that earlier song, right down to the wacky virtuoso vocals of Thijs Van Leer. But what a voice he had: able to stretch in a single crescendo from growling low bass to a high soprano even Jon Anderson couldn't dream of reaching.\"La Cathedral de Strasbourg\" and \"Birth\" are both more or less quintessential classical rock period pieces, firmly rooted in the Symphonic Prog soil of the mid-1970s. The former is a lush ballad in 3/4 time, with more falsetto Van Leer vocalizing and lots of debonair European whistling; the latter is a more straightforward instrumental rocker showcasing the chops of Jan Akkerman, one of the premier guitarists of his time (a shorter, alternate version of the song is included as a bonus to the CD).But it's the side-long title suite that stands as arguably the band's proudest moment. The title is a tongue-in-cheek mockery of J.S. Bach's \"Brandenburg Concertos\", but the music itself is lifted wholesale (and without acknowledgement) from Johannes Brahms, specifically Op. 56a, \"Variations on a Theme by Joseph Haydn\". Bach, Brahms, and Haydn: that's a lot of highbrow baggage to be carrying around, but it's a great piece of music, very smartly arranged and orchestrated. It may in fact be one of the best examples of classical rock ever attempted, continuing in dramatic leaps from the grandiose \"Starter\" movement to the mock operatic Rare (yes: more yodeling!) to the stately \"Medium\" and \"Well Done\" sections, featuring one of Jan Akkerman's more spellbinding guitar solos.This type of orchestral rock would be horribly out of fashion within two years of its release. But today it sounds better than ever, working almost like a Prog Rock primer for neophyte music students. Look no further than the extensive instrument list for proof, rivaling the best of Gentle Giant for variety and eclecticism: harpsichords and ARP synthesizers; accordions and Mellotrons; flutes and finger cymbals; so forth and so on...And all of it employed with more power and energy (not to mention good old-fashioned Prog Rock pretension) than anything else in the Focus discography, including the fluke of \"Hocus Pocus\". In other words, it may not exactly be cholesterol-free, but the meat of this burger is at least more organic than expected. High praise indeed from a born-again vegan like me."

          "text": "Focus is one of the symphonic progressive rock bands who have always been consistent in writing enjoyable records riddled with energy and fantastic musicianship, while remaining unique among their peers. Hamburger Concerto is one of their best albums, and they let their unique and fast paced supreme musicianship flags fly in the open for all to see.After the beautiful medieval courtroom styled ditty intro, \"Delitae Musicae\", the music of Focus comes in fast and furious. \"Harem Scarem\" is an extremely solid rocker based on steady bass thumps and a simple recognizable piano riff. This track is full of energy and is hard to dislike. Fans of Dixie Dregs would probably enjoy the music going on here. The guitar and flute solos in the middle section of the track are very melodic and add a slightly airy feel to this otherwise hard song.\"La Cathedrale de Strasbourg\" starts off on beautiful classical-inspired piano playing, accompanied by soft and powerful guitar perfectly in syncopation. The song eventually gives way to a sound that is somewhat jazzy with spacey sounding vocals and some of the best whistling you'll ever hear. There isn't much more to say about this song without being redundant; it's absolutely beautiful.A baroque inspired harpsichord solo kicks off \"Birth\" before pounding drums enter the picture, soon followed by a dark and heavy bass motif. Organ dominates the monstrous, bass full soundscape for a while before a flute dominated motif takes over. It all eventually gets soft and beautiful for the center portion with a terrifically melodic flute solo. There is a lot of blues influenced guitar work on this song as well, and that combined with the amounts flute make this album an obvious crossover appeal for Jethro Tull fans.The centerpiece, the epic \"Hamburger Concerto\" itself, is majestic. It's full of fantastically gripping rock riffs, which is one strength that this band has always had. The energy is perfect in that it will allow you to venture through the length of this track without feeling bored at all. Thijs van Leer has a knack for making anything sound interesting with his bizarre but strangely compelling yodel-scatting.As stated earlier, this album has great crossover appeal for Jethro Tull fans. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for some of the more rock-based symphonic prog with strong secondary influence in jazz-rock."

          "text": "Although many Focus fans swear by it, I can't say I find much to celebrate about Hamburger Concerto. Despite bringing in plenty of symphonic trimmings, several of the songs on this album are repetitive and unimaginative hard rock pieces at their core, and the title track adds nothing new to the already overpopulated prog subgenre of rock adaptations of classical music. The verve and energy present on Moving Waves is absent, and what's left behind is rather tired out and derivative, following the prog playbook whilst neither coming up with new tricks or breathing new vitality into old ones. Hardly the band's finest hour."

          "text": "Focus are an acquired taste but I have always been fascinated with their peculiar brand of music, especially the odd angular riffs and keyboard work of Thijs van Leer, who plays organ, piano, harpsichord, electric piano, flute, alto-flute, arp synthesiser, recorder mellotron, vibes, accordion, and the organ of St. Mary the Virgin. He is joined by Bert Ruiter on bass guitar, auto harp, triangles, chinese finger cymbals, handclaps, swiss bells, and Colin Allen is on drums, conga drum, tambourine, castanets, cabasa, woodblock, chinese gong, timpani, handclaps, flexatone, cuica, not to forget also Jan Akkerman on all guitars, lute, timpani, handclaps. They are a force to be reckoned with at their best and their best is definitely on this album.This album begins with Akkerman cleaning his lute on 'Delitae Musicae' which signifies the classical music influences. The album features one of their most beloved tracks, 'Harem Scarem' with its frenetic rhythm and comical vocal notations. The guitars are incredible along with the jaunty keyboard lines and it is only surpassed in popularity by 'Hocus Pocus'. The piano driven 'La Cathedrale De Strasbourg' is quite beautiful featuring cathedral church organ and some nice tinkling piano and clean guitar lines. There are vocals on this that work well with the music and some high pitch whistles. 'Birth' is a lengthy track with Renaissance overtones at first, very medieval sounding, and then a rhythmic drum pounds to make way for a pulsing bassline, and finally Leer's Hammond organ. This is a great piece of music and my favourite on side one. Akkerman has the spotlight on him as he powers out an emotional lead solo and notably the flute soling is divine.The album boasts the customary 70s accessory; the side long multi-movement suite that swallowed up half of the prog vinyls of that era. 'Hamburger Concerto' is a 20 minute instrumental in 6 parts; i) Starter, ii) Rare, iii) Medium, iv) Medium II, v) Well Done, vi) One For The Road. The symphonic sound is prominent, and Leer and Akkerman are at their best here. Of course on subsequent albums they will go their separate ways after disagreements in the ranks. Still we can enjoy their genius on this album and it must be hailed as one of the best things Focus have done. At about 6 and a half minutes in, Leer has some moments of vocal burbling which are okay be me, and even some of his idiosyncratic yodelling and high pitched falsetto ramblings. It is part of the inimitable Focus sound made famous on 'Hocus Pocus' so hard to argue with it here. His Hammond solo to follow is delightful. The sound at 17 minutes is wall to wall grandeur and a very powerful finale. What an intricate musical masterpiece. The album throws in one more short thing for good measure, 'Early Birth', with nice guitar but I am already overloaded by the suite previously. All I can say is this is one fine album and perhaps the best Focus though I have only heard about 4. In any case, this is quintessential Focus paradise."

          "text": "Forth album - Hamburger concerto from 1974 is considered by many the absolut peak of their career, here the duo Jan Akkerman & Thijs Van Leer works in a perfect unison. Well, to me Hamburger concerto is in same league with Moving waves, has same musical patters, same attitude and almost same sound. Harem scarem is like Hocus pocus part 2, a very humoristic piece, well performed with catchy arrangements, again the most solid part of the release is in the end of the album with the title track, a 20 min prog bomb. A very worthy album that consolidates the master status they had in those times, both Moving waves and this one are considered among the best prog albums of the first part of the seventies. 4 stars for Hamburger concerto for sure."

          "text": "I recently listened to this album for the first time. I thought that after their \"Focus 3\" album, with all the excess in that album with a lot of improvisations to fill a two LP set there were not better things to expect from this band. I was wrong. I was curious to listen to this album for years and I finally did it. It is one of best albums that I have listened from them (apart from \"Moving Waves\" from 1971), but I think that Pierre van der Linden`style in the drums was better for this band, being him a better technically drummer than Colin Allen whose drumming I found more simple in comparison. Van der Linden is a more Jazz-Rock and Progressive Rock oriented drummer, in my opinion. But Allen is a good percussionist too, also providing a variety of percussion instruments than van der Linden didn`t use with the band. This album has a lot of melodies and very good arrangements, most of them very influenced by classical music (in fact, the \"Hamburger Concerto\" is based in \"Variations from a Theme from Haydn by Brahms\") , some medieval and folk music and even some religious music. Thijs Van Leer used a lot of keyboard instruments with a lot of very good arrangements, and his humour is also present in some of his vocals, particularly in the \"Hamburger Concerto\" title song, which also in itself is an humorous title, like a joke in reference to J.S. Bach`s \"Brandenburger Concertos\". Jan Akkerman also sounds very inspired playing his guitars. So, this album is very Progressive Rock in style, one of the best from this style, wth the band still at their peak and with a lot of creativity powers and enthusiasm. A very recomendable album."

          "text": "To my ears ''Sylvia'' is among the top 3 tracks ever recorded by Focus and this was also the belief of the audience back in the 70's, as the single climbed on No. 4 of the UK charts, while ''Focus 3'' reached No. 6 in the album charts.What followed was a triumphant first tour in USA and several gigs in the UK, among them a pair of lives at London's Rainbow Theatre in 1973, taped on the live release ''Focus at the Rainbow'' and released again on Imperial and Polydor.According to Thijs van Leer the intense live activity of the band affected the composing quality and the musicians were somewhat empty of ideas around the time.This led to Pierre van der Linden departure, while he was replaced by Colin Allen.The next work of Focus sees the light in 1974, based on ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn'' by Johannes Brahms.The album was recorded at the Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes between January and March 74'.The symphonic-oriented short intro ''Delitiae Musicae'' will give its place to ''Harem Scarem'', which supposedly played the role of the chart single of the album.Its delicate, symphonic-oriented sound and the furious interplays though were not something close to the likings of the public and, despite its good quality and the intense progressive nature, it failed to attract the audience.''La Cathedrale de Strasbourg'' is a romantic, Classical-influenced piece of delicate Symphonic Rock with wordless voices, jazzy guitar interludes by Akkerman and beautiful piano work by van Leer, resulting an extremely balanced composition of elegant instrumental music.With ''Birth'' Focus revisit some of the aspects of their early days, as this one contains heavy flute-driven parts, light psychedelic tunes and strong organ work.But Focus had musically moved on in this fourth studio album and these premature inspirations are cleverly dressed up with Classical-drenched harsichord textures and virtuosic guitar moves by Akkerman, including some very powerful solos.The 20-min. title track of the album is yet another great idea, added in the list of epic tracks by Focus.This one contains the distinctive humor of the band, as it is divided in six movements, developing the cooking of a hamburger.''Hamburger Concerto'' comes a mix of organ-driven Symphonic Rock with smooth psychedelic overtones and jazzy-influenced Progressive Rock with light jams on guitars and organ, while in several occasions van Leer's flute really shines through.It lacks some cohesion in the way, but this belongs definitely among the nice epics of the mid-70's, offering diverse atmospheres, ranging from sweet themes with a smooth playing by the band to heavier, technical interplays and solos with a pompous climate, while the chant-like vocals and the sharp and surprising synthesizer solo towards the end are quite intelligent additions.Maybe not masterful, but this is well-executed and very rich instrumental music.At this point it gets quite clear that Focus is rather impossible to reach the marvelous level of composing as presented on ''Moving waves''.Tensions within the group led eventually to a great album with series of tight interplays, orchestral majesty and calm melodies, which struggle a bit to connect with each other.Even so, this one should belong to the discography of a Prog fan for its sincere, professional and bombastic perfromances.Strongly recommended...3.5 stars."

          "text": "I don't envy whomever has to decide how to classify artists into subgenres on this site! Focus is symphonic prog - - OK, works for me.Hamburger Concertoopens with \"Delit\ufffd Music\ufffd,\" a prog-folk number written by guitarist Jan Akkerman, which is followed by \"Harem Scarem,\" a symphonic piece by keyboardist Thijs van Leer with a distinct jazzy (though not necessarily fusiony) interlude. After van Leer's \"La Cathedrale de Strasbourg,\" which seems largely symphonic, side one ends with Akkerman's \"Birth,\" whose clear folk, jazz, and classic-rock elements are at least as prominent as its symphonic elements. Based on this LP side, one might guess this was a symphonic prog artist, but guesses of prog-related or possibly \"eclectic prog\" might also be reasonable.Anyway, side two is given toHamburger Concerto's title track, written jointly by Akkerman and van Leer. On the digital download I have, this is followed by \"Early Birth,\" a variation of \"Birth\" which, as noted by prior reviewers, acts as a reprise of that song, and is a nice way to end the album, even if the original LP ended with \"One for the Road,\" the final section of \"Hamburger Concerto.\" Surprisingly, although it's divided into six sections with distinct writing credits, the 20-minute \"Concerto\" does not come across as a medley of distinct songs; its sections flow together nicely. At the same time, its variety of themes and styles compliments the first side and its stylistic contrasts.This album appeared a year or so after Focus hit the US top ten with the single \"Hocus Pocus.\" Maybe I'm the only one who views \"Hocus Pocus\" as a novelty song, but at least technically, yodeling in a pop songwasa novelty in in 1973 - - and I'm pretty sure it still is. While \"Hocus Pocus\" has the potential for being annoying, I enjoy it.Hamburger Concertois not a \"Hocus Pocus\" soundalike, but there's no doubt that it's a product of the same band. And by the time van Leer is using his voice as an instrument for the fourth or fifth time on side two, it does approach obnoxiousness.Nonetheless,Hamburger Concertois a good listen. Other than my minor complaints about the (wordless) vocals, I'd say this album maintains a consistent level of quality in performance and composition. Maybe the most prominent exception is the album's high point, \"Harem Scarem.\" I agree with those who say that \"Harem Scarem\" is the song on this album which is most like \"Hocus Pocus;\" although parts of \"Concerto\" sound more like parts of \"Hocus Pocus,\" \"Harem Scarem\" more resembles \"Hocus Pocus\" from the standpoint of composition.A good, though nonessential, product from Focus."

          "text": "Review N\ufffd 461Focus is a Dutch progressive rock band formed in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in 1969, by Thijs van Leer. The band has undergone numerous formations in their history. Formed of members of the pit band for the Dutch production of the rock musical \"Hair\", Focus released their debut studio album \"In And Out Of Focus\", in 1970. But, their debut gained little attention outside the Netherlands. They only started to gain popularity following the success of \"Focus II\", released in 1971. The success continued with \"Focus 3\", released in 1972 and \"Hamburger Concerto\", released in 1974.So, \"Hamburger Concerto\" is the fourth studio album of Focus and was released in 1974. As happened before, for the third time, the band suffered another change into their line up. Pierre van der Linden, the drummer of the group was replaced by the ex-Stone The Crows drummer Collin Allen, even before Focus recorded \"Hamburger Concerto\".So, the line up on the album is Thijs van Leer (vocals, keyboards, organ, flute and piano), Jan Akkerman (guitar), Bert Ruiter (bass guitar) and Collin Allen (drums).\"Hamburger Concerto\" has six tracks. The first track \"Delitiae Musicae\" written by Jan Akkerman is a short but at the same time magnificent piece which instantly sets what will be the classic mood on the album. This is a beautiful classic piece of music influenced by the Renaissance and Medieval music that introduces us perfectly well in the mood of this fantastic album. The second track \"Harem Scarem\" written by Thijs van Leer represents a musical proposal completely different. It's a very rock oriented song, with some jazz influences, very frantic from the start to the end. This is a song where we can perfectly see, on the vocals and \"lyrics\", some the usual \"insanity\" of Thijs van Leer. It's another magnificent piece of music with impressive guitar and piano works. The third track \"La Cathedral De Strasbourg\" written by Thijs van Leer represents another change in the musical direction on the album. It's an extremely beautiful piece of music with very calm voices and with church organ and bells. This is a perfect song, an incredible and beautiful track, one of their best and one of my favourites too. It's a song that evokes perfectly well the grandeur and majesty of the Gothic Cathedral of Strasbourg. The fourth track \"Birth\" written by Jan Akkerman represents another surprising, perfect and magnificent musical moment on the album. It's a song with a nice harpsichord introduction by Thijs van Leer that changes and oscillates the musical atmosphere of the song between the classical and rock. It features also solos between Thijs van Leer and Jan Akkerman, where they show their skills, perfectly well. This is truly a unique and brilliant song and it's also absolutely delightful. The fifth track is the title track \"Hamburger Concerto\". It's divided into six parts. All the six parts were written by Thijs van Leer and Jan Akkerman, alternately. This great piece of music represents the epic moment on the album and is a suite with about 20 minutes long. This theme always was and remains one of Focus' most accomplished pieces of music, in terms of musical construction, and it has an incredible mixtures of styles and genres and represents also one of the best progressive musical moments, ever made by anyone. This piece of music is, in my humble opinion, the best and the perfect way to describe and show the music of Focus, and how their music can be so beautiful and perfect, in some moments. Believe me, you only can understand what I'm saying if you hear it. The sixth track \"Early Birth\" written by Jan Akkerman is, as the name says, a reprise of \"Birth\". It's, in reality, a magnificent and perfect way to close the album. Unfortunately, since is a song that comes after the title track, there is a tendency not to be noticed, what is totally unfair. This is also a great song, in the same vein of \"Birth\", where once more we can hear a great guitar work by Jan Akkerman, a great flute solo and also a good bass playing.Conclusion: I completely agree with Easy Livin when he says that \"Hamburger Concerto\" is by far the best and more accomplished album of Focus. It's true that \"Moving Waves\" and \"Focus 3\" are two great albums. We we even can say, in a certain way, the same about \"In And Out Of Focus\". However, \"Hamburger Concerto\" is another thing. \"Hamburger Concerto\" is their most progressive album and it's also the only perfect album made by Focus. It's also their only album that deserves to be considered a masterpiece. \"Hamburger Concerto\" is also one of the best albums produced in the 70's. I even dare to say that \"Hamburger Concerto\" is one of the best and most perfect progressive rock albums ever made. \"Hamburger Concerto\" represents the band in the peak of their form and explains why Focus is considered the best Dutch progressive rock band, why is considered one of the best and most influential progressive rock bands, and finally, why it's so respected, even today, in the progressive rock world. Unfortunately, \"Hamburger Concerto\" represents also the last great album made by them, in the 70's, and the beginning of the divorce between Thijs van Leer and Jan Akkerman, what would take place in the next year, after the release of their fifth studio album \"Mother Focus\".Prog is my Ferrari.

          "text": "After their successful Focus II and Focus III, the Dutch band led by the cerebral duo Thijs van Leer / Jan Akkerman so fond of academic classical music, takes the work \"Variations on a Theme by Haydn\" by the 19th century German composer Johannes Brahms, as an inspirational reference point for their fourth album, \"Hamburger Concerto\".A work lavished with atmospheres of diverse dimensions through an instrumentation that flows soberly, from the medieval character that Akkerman's lute accompanied by van Leer's gentle flute conveys in the brief and crystalline \"Delitae Musicae\" (an adaptation of the 16th century Dutch composer Joachim van den Hove), the folk reminiscences of the spirited \"Harem Scarem\" and van Leer's unmistakably Tyrolean vocal registers bordering on the burlesque, the heavenly airs emanating from organs and synthesizers in the ecclesiastical \"La Cathedrale de Strasbourg\", to the renaissance-rock intensity of \"Birth\" which, after the incandescent harpsichord intro and the wandering flute, delivers Akkerman's excellent guitar solo.But the ultimate gem comes with the suite \"Hamburger Concerto\", a huge and superlative piece divided in six parts that condenses the classical, jazz and progressive influences that Focus uses to build it. The epic keyboard opening is joined by a forceful guitar riff, similar to the one later developed by Rush in \"In the End\" from their \"Fly by Night\", the sober bass of Bert Ruiter and the correct percussion of Colin Allen, to gradually create hypnotic and solid sound carpets that allow both the virtuoso showcasing of van Leer with his artillery of pianos, organs and mellotrons (iii. Medium I), as well as Akkerman's electric guitar, at times elegant, at times harsh, coupled with van Leer's sung verses borrowed from the Dutch carol \"O Kerstnacht, schoner dan de dagen\" (iv. Medium II). The final section finds the suite at its instrumental peak, with the opening guitar riff reappearing, complemented by a luminous synthesiser to conclude the piece majestically. Undoubtedly one of the Dutchman's finest compositions.\"Hamburger Concerto\" brings the band's most splendid and renowned period to a brilliant close. Unfortunately, the constant disagreements between van Leer and Akkerman regarding the paths to follow and the musicians who should accompany them on the journey, would end up affecting Focus' musical proposal for the second part of the 70's.Excellent4/4,5 stars"

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "biography": "Focus biography\n\nFounded in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1969 - disbanded in 1978 - reunited 1985, 1990, 1999 - reformed in 2002\n\nOf all the groups in the 1970s that combined elements of rock and classical music, FOCUS is, without a doubt, the most notable Dutch group widely known outside the Netherlands. This band has created excitement all over the world during the past few years with their unique sound and musical approach. The two main musicians in the band were flutist/keyboardist/singer Thijs Van LEER and guitarist\n\nJan AKKERMAN\n\n. They played a stylishly inventive rock with flutes, keyboards & dazzling guitar, defining the Dutch prog sound. An inspiration to FINCH, TRACE & numerous others. In 1978, the group finally split up, without making too much noise.\n\nBest albums are \"Moving Waves\" (1972), \"3\" (1973), \"Live at the Rainbow\" (1973), and \"Hamburger Concerto\" (1974). \"Waves\" and \"3\" represent the best of the band's earlier intensely progressive period with plenty of sidelong tracks and healthly extended solos. Most will agree that \"Live at the Rainbow\" and \"Hamburger Concerto\" (last good album) were their best, moving into a period of more pure classical and jazz influence.\n\n\"Focus 8\" marks the return of Thijs Van LEER in the true nature of music: tuneful, memorable and a little bit rocky when they want to be. This album contains everything you might want from a FOCUS album ... plenty of flute and keyboards from Thijs, tasty guitar playing from Jan DUM\ufffdE and even some yodeling vocals. Perhaps in summary, the band could have veered a little from the safety of the FOCUS blueprint but \"Focus 9\" may yet further develop their own voice. No doubt about it, we'll have to count on FOCUS in the new millennium to all of the true Progressive Rock lovers.",

Such a good album to start with that even ELP started with this one also .Take A Pebble is fantastic and so are Tank And Barbarian . It is hard to fault those three guys for having left their respective groups - Lake's choice to leave Crimson was disputable but valid and The Nice was a spent force and Atomic Rooster would go on to better things.Actually , if you can believe it my least fave is Lucky Man as it is relatively out of line with the rest of the album and that long Moog solo does not do much for me.If you are discovering ELP , this would be the perfect album for an intro and work through their discography chronologically untill..... you feel like it!"

          "text": "Lucky menA bold statement for a first album, but given the supergroup tag instantly applied to ELP, this was perhaps to be expected.I love ELP's music, but almost every album includes a track or tracks I don't get. This album is no exception. There are six tracks in all, three on each side of the LP. \"The Barbarian\" is a great instrumental introduction, pacey, and accessible. \"Take a Pebble\" is a soft acoustic track with Greg Lake in fine vocal form,, and playing some wonderful acoustic guitar. The track includes a lengthy middle section which drifts into jazz piano, before returning to the main theme for the conclusion. While I have grown to love this track, I've always felt that an edited version without the piano section could sound better. Incidentally, the opening chords are actually played by Keith Emerson who is strumming his piano strings.\"Knife edge\" is reminiscent of Atomic Rooster's \"Tomorrow night\", the closest thing to a single on the album. \"The three fates\" is for me theAchilles heelof the album. It is a vehicle for displaying Emerson's keyboard prowess, but leaves me completely cold.\"Tank\" is a powerful instrumental, but in retrospect the showpiece drum solo was indulgent, and at best far too long. \"Tank\" and the last track \"Lucky man\" both featured a unique sound at the time from Emerson's moog synthesiser. It's hard to explain now, just howdifferentthe synth solos on these two tracks sounded when the album was released. Even today they send shivers up my spine.By all accounts, \"Lucky man\" was a late addition to the album, and did not take long to record. The version of the Synthesiser solo included was the first take. Ironic then that this is arguably the best track on the album.I have no hesitation in highly recommending the album, but feel free to skip through the odd track (or drum solo!)."

          "text": "Well it's a stunning debut album, characterized by some unforgettable tracks as well as tepid or annoying episodes in the same time...\"Lucky Man\" as a ballad was a famous hit single, but it's totally out of contest, in comparison for example to the splendid \"The Barbarian\" or the Fugue inside \"Knife Edge\" ...instead the mini-suite \"Three Fates\" is a controversial idea by EMERSON alone and it's not always inspiring from the point of view of its composition, even though his skill is excellent as usual!! Recommended, despite of being essential in some circumstances only...\"Tank\" is another example of PALMER's great skill, but once again the composition is quite \"cold\" and academic as well!!"

          "text": "This is their first album. Progressive rock. The songs are rather varied and do not have the same style. The keyboards on \"The Barbarian\" have the typical TRIUMVIRAT sound. There is also on it electric guitar which I consider rather bland. ELP is not a band to listen for the electric guitar.Take a pebble is one of the best ELP songs: catchy piano, excellent lead vocals, loud and complex bass, subtle drums parts, the song can be mellow and progressive. \"Knife \"Edge\" has a fully distorted organ sound through keyboards solo. The piano on \"Three Fates\" is absolutely outstanding: Keith EMERSON is a virtuoso, that's obvious. \"Tank\" is an instrumental track full of fast bass, drums and keyboards. Unique. There is the mellow pop \"Lucky Man\" with simple acoustic guitar."

          "text": "ELP get up and running with 'The Barbarian' as Carl Palmer ably demonstrates why he won so many drum polls. Then follows the majestic 'Take A Pebble' which has become one of the high points of ELP's music.Keith Emerson's piano work is exceptional ,well beyond the normal boundaries of 'popular music' while Greg Lake sings in his typical laid back style.Perfect. My least favourite track on the album 'Knife Edge' makes good use of Lake's deep baritone but I find the structure flawed and it lacks the usual fluidity I associate with ELP.'Three Fates' is a chance for Emerson to demonstrate his considerable skills and show off he does. Amazing piano and church organ! 'Tank' is very much a chance for Palmer to indulge his love of all things Buddy Rich and Emerson gets to have some fun as well.'Lucky Man' finishes the album on a highpoint with Emerson's powerfull moog solo. Overall this is a solid debut album that falls only marginally short of being a masterpeice."

          "text": "Dark and mysterious, Emerson Lake & Palmer's debut album is one of the better prog albums that came out in 1970, displaying Palmer's impressive drumming and Emerson's fantastic keyboards. It kicks off with 'The Barbarian', with an aggressive bass guitar opening that sounds very reminiscent of what King Crimson was all about at that time, backed up with some furious keys and a frenetic rhythm section. A very good opener that eventually leads into 'Take a Pebble, a longer, more delicate track that effectively shows the bands melodic sensibilities, as well as Greg Lake's fine vocals and acoustic guitar playing, before the band goes into a jazzier conclusion halfway through the piece. 'Knife Edge' is another rocker with great riffing and yet another solid performance from Lake and should probably be the lead single here instead of the rather lackluster (IMO) 'Lucky Man' (though I can see why they chose that one instead to boost some sales ;) ), but 'Three Fates' is a brilliant showcase for Emerson's piano and keyboard virtuosity that move through three very distinct and different parts. Probably my favorite track here overall. 'Tank' features a fun and quirky intro before switching to a great drum solo by Palmer, the tune is a nice counterpart to the previous 'Fates'. The album overall actually feels more subdued than their later albums, with a nice balance between very good songwriting and virtuostic playing, while the next 'Tarkus' would go even harder and more overboard. Their debut remains a classic prog album, as well as one of the better introductions to the band. Highly recommended!"

This album stands out in a satisfying way: there's NO signs of fatigue in ANY tracks. No 'Are you ready Eddy?' or 'Crystal Bitches' (stupid name...).The Barbarian really gives the impression of a drooling bearded viking chasing you around with a rusty axe having the idea of bringing home your limbs as a trophy. One heck of a chase. There's a lot more of acoustic piano on this one; Keith giving his best shot on many tracks like Three Fates and Knife- Edge. Lake is charming us again with a beautiful gift in Take a Pebble. Relaxing, floating, country-style interlude and sets place for a lot of mental travelling, thanks to Greg's clear and magnificent voice. It's like a new King Crimson song in the old 1969 way.Don't expect grandiose extravangance like Brain Salad Surgery but also no signs of by-products a la Tarkus, making this record the only one like that in their repertoire.It's more serious, aggressive and challenging and yet, very less entertaining."

          "text": "Essential - but I wouldn't recommend it...Although there is much evidence of creativity, an approach full of inspired drama and a wide range of great ideas, there are altogether too many flaws in this album for me to give it the full masterpiece status - which, to be fair, it practically begs for! That in itself is mainly why I do not give it the coveted award - generally the trio try too hard to impress, and not enough to write music of distinction.\"The Barbarian\" features Greg using a fuzz box which sounds very much like one I bought many, many moons ago - and was ancient then! Great, retro fuzzy sound, and intriguingly panned across the stereo, but somewhat ponderous.Keith then demonstrates how to play the organ with boxing gloves... I only jest slightly, for amongst the deliberate dischords, there is evidence of clumsy fingers and slightly poor timekeeping that makes a trained keyboard player such as myself balk somewhat. That said, there is much inventive keyboard work in this track, much of which reminds me of some of the early twentieth century French composers - and fine stuff it is too... except that it's a bit directionless and doesn't really gel into anything much.It's only when Greg swings the bass back into action with a bit more volulme applied that we are reminded that this track is entitled \"The Barbarian\". Palmer, of course, keeps things ticking away nicely with sensitive drumming crammed full of suble technical goodies and punctuation - although, on the whole, unremarkable, except for that gong!On the whole then, an opening designed to grab the listener's attention that does not really sustain it despite the increase in intensity, because of the lack of direction and the keyboard \"fluffs\".Moving on to \"Take a Pebble\", which apparently starts with Keith dragging a plectrum across the strings of a piano. Ineffectually for the opening, he changes to a more delicate motif, then steps around to the proper playing area of the instrument and produces wonderful rippling music of a sublime quality. In the meantime, Greg rolls out some fat root notes and Palmer produces fine, sensitive percussion... and then there are the vocals. I am not keen on this particular style of singing - and even less keen on the lyrics - so will leave it there before I upset the ELP fan base!Around the 3 minute mark, we get more piano ideas based around the rippling motifs - and, mysteriously, more of the piano string scraping, before an ultra-quiet acoustic guitar led section in a different key. This inexplicably builds to a hand-clap accompanied climax before subsiding again - presumably the idea here is to build a series of \"movements\", but a little continuity would be nice! Keith has the idea when he re-introduces the rippling piano, but stylistically develops it. One or two fluffs don't mar this section, which drives onwards, maintaining the French style I observed earlier. Palmer picks up a nice jazz rhythm, and Lake wanders coolly around the bass and the music develops naturally and easily for a while, but wanders a little here and there into uncertain territory. There is something of the King Crimson lurking in here - if only I could put my finger on it...\"Knife Edge\" is a bit of a mystery to me still - I like the crunchy riffing, and the quiet - loud - quiet - loud construction should resonate with anyone into Nirvana style grunge. Keith shows again why he should take those boxing gloves off, producing solo lines with more fluff than the average rabbit. The direction gets almost completely lost about midway, attempting to draw from Bach, but fortunately it's all pulled back together in a somewhat cacaphonous fashion full of technical tid-bits, and dramatically stirring in many ways - but a little too short of melody for me.The Three Fates section starts off with Keith donning heavy duty boxing gloves for his duties on the Royal Festival Hall organ, playing pretty much what he likes, with virtually no direction - believe me, I've played church organs, and know only too well the temptation to just pull out all the stops, stomp on the really low pedals and the swell and see what drops out - it all sounds very impressive, so you temper it with some softer noises in between. It only impresses me if someone can produce great music that way - listen to Saint-Seans organ concerto to see what I mean.Clotho is the youngest of the Three fates - the spinner and daughter of the night (OK, technically one of the oldest godesses in Greek mythology, and daughter of Zeus and Themis, but I digress). I would have expected less Bombast and more \"dark\", less showing off and more tempered, yet slightly out of control spinning in the music.However, the piano section that follows is full of Scriabin-like drama tempered with Debussy-esque soft chords and shows that Keith can find his way round a keyboard with both hands - very convincingly. He's also well played (as in the sense of well-read) - hark! Is that Beethoven I hear? After another burst of organ, we get a deliciously dischordant piano riff that builds up with bass and drums into a mesmerising section full of minimalist devices a la Steve Reich, and a peculiar rattlesnake noise coming from Palmer's direction - if only the rest of the album were at this kind of quality!Lachesis is the apportioner, decider of life duration for mortals, and Atropos the inevitable cuts the thread at the end of your existence so it's more difficult to have a preconceived idea for the music - but this works. Maybe I haven't heard the section beginnings and ends correctly, as this suite is well blended, but no matter - the first goddess is the only one I have issues with (musically...!).\"Tank\" features a drum solo. For us non-drummers it's OK on the first couple of listens, but gives me nothing lasting except a desire to skip past this bit every time I listen to this album - which is a trifle unfair on Palmer, as it is an excellent solo. I'm not sure what they were thinking when they wrote the section after the drum solo, as it is stodgy and generally horrible - especially that ridiculous shrieking... Sorry. I have nothing nice to say about this section.\"Lucky Man\" rounds off the album with a nice acoustic intro and more of those dodgy lyrics - although we can more easily take these as tongue-in-cheek. A standard kind of verse-singalong chorus structure makes a real contrast from the more progressive music which makes up the rest of the album - replete with FM rock guitar solo, it has to be noted! Pleasant enough, although the keyboard solo at the end is an odd touch... still, proves we have a geniune prog album on our hands - even if it's not a masterpiece!Worthy addition to your prog collection, but don't expect magic."

The Barbarian has some awesome drumming on it accompanied by very good music. You can almost feel the horses of the Mongols strafeing by you as you dodge their merciless blades. Well named song and proof from the start they are able to effectively paint a picture with music. \"The Three Muses\" is an excellent composition and shows off the keyboard playing skills this group has. Particularly, \"Atropos\" the piano trio. It is one of the heaviest piano songs I have heard, being very masculine and jagged. Lucky Man was always one of my favorite songs on the radio. The term 'lucky man' is first used in the song as a statement of envy but later as the 'lucky man' is called to war and is killed the statement, 'lucky man', morphs to sarcasam. You will find as you listen to their albums that in a few ways they are kind of morose. Which in my opinion is delightful and refreshing. Screw \"Peace dude\" how about saying \"People are dying for a pointless cause, fell happy now?\" it's a little more direct and snags upon the ugly truth of conflict a little better in my opinion. This is a great song on a great album. I would have given it 4.5 stars."

          "text": "An impressive first album from this trio, demonstrating a confidence and maturity that is, on reflection, not surprising given the previous experience of the band members. Listening to this album in the early 1970s it was not difficult to believe this band was destined to go far.'The Barbarian' is the trio's heavy interpretation of Bart\ufffdk's \"Allegro Barbaro\", which is itself sombre and 'barbaric' in feel. Emerson's piano and synthesizer playing really brings out the almost demonic feel of the piece, and Palmer's skill is also evident almost from the first bar. Quite an ambitious opener for a first album - the band clearly wanted to start with a bang.'Take A Pebble' starts with piano and the strumming of piano strings, and bass, introducing the rich timbre of Lake's voice, which is pleasing. He does not sing for long before the piece turns instrumental, with some very good piano and percussion from Emerson and Palmer. The instrumental then continues with acoustic guitar that, oddly (at least to me), sounds more like something one would hear in the Appalachians than from a progressive rock band. It's certainly very laid-back and pleasing, but I'm not sure this section of acoustic guitar fits particularly well into the piece as a whole. Then Emerson comes back in with piano - again very good - and the piece feels as if it's back on track. Palmer jumps in a bit later and the piece almost starts to feel like barroom jazz. There's a pause in the track and the piano then returns to reintroduce Lake's singing for a short while to complete the twelve-and-a-half minute track.'Knife-Edge' is the trio's interpretation of the first movement (Allegretto, Allegro, Maestoso) of Jan\ufffd\u010dek's Sinfonietta for orchestra, Opus 60, but with the addition of Lake's singing. As with 'The Barbarian', this interpretation of a classical piece also works well. Emerson's keyboard sounds like a church organ, albeit a very funky one. This track is also heavy in places, but a real 'foot-tapper' (or should that be 'head banger'?), and the lyrics are manic and dark. Again I've got to say that Palmer's drumming is noticeably very good.'The Three Fates' (the goddesses Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos from Greek mythology) starts with 'Clotho': Emerson playing the Royal Festival Hall's organ, which is such an impressive, deep, ecclesiastical sounding organ with rich reverberation. Then piano replaces the organ for 'Lachesis' - very classically inspired piano - that is very pleasing indeed if, like me, you are a big fan of the piano. Part of this sounds a little Rachmaninov-like when Emerson speeds up (not that I'm comparing Emerson to the great Rachmaninov). 'Atropos' is a piano trio in which Palmer backs Emerson with some good and varied percussion. Again there is a slight jazzy feel to this. Actually, it also makes me think of some of the music in West Side Story, so perhaps it has a hint of the Latin to it.And then comes my favourite track of the album, 'Tank'. The clavichord-sounding synthesizer (or maybe it's a real clavichord or harpsichord?) sounds excellent, and the track fairly scuttles along until Palmer gives a two-minute solo that again shows this drummer's skill. And when the solo ends with the synthesized swishing from speaker to speaker and the marching, fat synthesizer with pounding drumbeat and high-pitched synthesizer dancing over the top almost like a flute, it's the absolute business. You could easily picture a formidable army marching relentlessly forward to this.The last track, 'Lucky Man', is a ballad by Lake with acoustic guitar leading and ironic lyrics. Although the song has a simple structure and the lyrics might be considered slightly pretentious, the tune and chorus are pleasing, and this is something to which I find myself humming or whistling along. Emerson's Moog synthesizer 'pyrotechnics' come in towards the end and the piece ends with just that and Palmer's drums.Well, what more can be said? The album is not a masterpiece although it is certainly a showcase for the playing skills of Emerson and Palmer, although less of a chance for Lake to shine than on their later albums. Emerson always borrowed heavily, and here a third of the tracks are the band's interpretations of pieces by classical composers. If you listen to the original pieces you'll see that the interpretations are actually quite close to the originals (and you'll also hear how good the originals are!), but at least the band has given them a good twist. To me, though, 'Tank' is the best track on this album (and much better than the version on \"Works, Volume 1\", but that's another story). Nevertheless, all of the tracks are good, and all three musicians produced an album that I still listen to some thirty years later, which says something."

          "text": "What an excellent debut for this pioneer of prog rock supergroups! The talents of Emerson, Lake & Palmer are fluidly combined with their enthusiasm for this new project they were undertaking. Emerson basically continued to explore into his diverse musical interests (jazz, classical, rock, psychedelia) while assuming a prominent leading role; Lake felt much comfortable with the new band's melodic drive, while keeping a hard edge in a large amount of his bass parts; and Palmer, who was already a young veteran in the rock-blues scene, had and took the chance to expand his artistic vision and develop it with a clear disposition for pomposity. ELP's eponymous debut album was also one of the first ones to feature the Moog stuff in a rock context, a synthesizer that Emerson has already begun to experiment with during his last days with his Nice partners. Every single piece contained in this repertoire is great; as a whole, the selection showcases varied ambiences that result from the threesome's different individual interests converging into a unique, solid offering. The only minus point is a certain lack of cohesiveness in the repertoire, as a whole: there is no chaos here, and the listener can tell that the band members have a clear direction set in their minds, but I feel that the inner consistency is not totally achieved. This factor will soon be resolved properly in some of their following albums, which are absolute prog classics, indeed. Anyway, let's take a quick look at the repertoire itself. 'The Barbarian' starts with a wicked bass guitar riff by Lake, as a herald that briefly announces the storm of Hammond chord progressions delivered by Emerson: during the Dixieland-oriented interlude and the reprise of the initial motif, the trio sounds very tight and confident. 'Take a Pebble' shows a gentler side of ELP's music. Having been conceived as an acoustic ballad by Lake, Emerson takes it to a more sophisticated level, flirting with free jazz and Gershwin, while Palmer sustains his partners' performances with both sensibility and delicate precision. This song lasts 12 minutes, and it's definitely quite pretentious, but it's not overwhelming in its pretentiousness, mainly because the sense of reflectiveness that remains consistent from beginning to end helps the trio build a complicity with the listener: Emerson's piano passages that meander like a flowing stream, and Lake's country-inspired acoustic guitar solo are relevant for this matter. Then comes 'Knife Edge', a track that is quite paradigmatic of the ELP most habitual power-trio sound: aggressiveness and exquisiteness, both fused into one sonic source. 'The Three Fates' is a showcase for Emerson's virtuosity and passion: it displays its successive motifs on pipe organ, grand piano, and a Latin jazz oriented piano trio that closes down the track with a rough explosion. The exhibition of power and pomposity doesn't end, since 'Tank' serves as a vehicle for Palmer's exhibitionism: the jazz section and the bluesy section are intertwined by an effective solo (which includes some of Palmer's signature double gong banging). Thought less articulated than the previous tour-de-force, this one is much catchier, indeed. And then, as a closure, the unexpected hit single - 'Lucky Man'. Penned a few years ago by a teenager Lake who by then only dreamt about becoming a rock star, this is basically an acoustic ballad with a simple structure, with a conventional country-based electric guitar solo in the middle. But it is Palmer's precise drumming, Lake's occasional multi-layered vocal harmonies, and last but not least, Emerson's outstanding Moog solo in the final section, that take this track to a higher level. The sober beauty of the original idea is enhanced in a most superb manner: a great closure, indeed. As I stated before, the fact that the repertoire in itself is not entirely cohesive, keeps this record from deserving the perfect rating, but it comes close: and more importantly, it is a prelude of better things to come in the following three years."

I only know about this bands sound and career from things i have read on this site, so i wasn't completely sure what to expect.I certainly didn't expect that lush distorted droning sound to kick off the album, that is really nice. There is some strong drum work here but i think it is ruined by some very over dramatic piano work, but i managed to sit through it, once the piano bit is over there is a lush roar that sounds likea dragon waking up and then some more distortion which sounds kinda heavy and evil! Definetly a good start, i am actually impressed by \"The Barbarian\". The bass and drum work is very well done!The vocals on \"Take a Pebble\" are pretty nice, somehow it sounds like a very unique sound that ELP have created very nicely here, and Greg Lake uses a different vocal style to King Crimson which is good because it is the start of a brand new sound and prog direction for each member, quite a big leap for a debut album, they have definetly kissed their previous bands goodbye! The piano work is a lot softer here, with some nice acoustics, which i prefer. I can't remember the last time i heard clapping and whistling in prog, how random, but it's here! The soft sound seems to lack direction, going through different acoustic and piano areas before it settles into a beautiful piano section. The thundering bass kicks in and all sounds good. This track can stretch on quite a bit, but i say, so far so good! There is a nice piano climax just before the 11 minute mark that leads back into some vocals, bringing this track to a brilliant close. The vocals are powerful and full of passion and emotion.\"Knife Edge\" has some really strong bass and keyboard work, perhaps a sound that i prefer. It can get quite frantic and then flow into more steady parts. The vocals work really well once again. The musicianship here is definetly strong and powerful, sometimes it can be scarily overdone, i prefer them in their less pretentious areas.The first three songs are excellent, but \"Three Fates\", the track that a very popular forum member is named after, let me down. This track is nothing but Keith Emerson making love to his keyboards for nearly 8 minutes. Sure he has talent but he is just showing off here, and it becomes boring. I managed to sit through this though, it gets interesting when the organ comes in but then it leads back into the same old drizzle. There is a really annoying sound, like someone is winding up a clock which quickly gets repetitive and irritating. I would suggest listening to this one or two times, if it still doesn't do anything for you then the skip button is all you need!\"Tank\" doesn't do it for me either, another let down, this is just some mindless drum work, followed by some uninterting tag ons from the rest of the band. ELP really overdo it here. \"Lucky Man\" definetly redeems this album with some nice vocals and acoustic work, yet it has a stupid ending which sounds like you are being chased by an ambulance or something!ELP are definetly talented as well as unique and original. Sometimes they can really overdo it and dont know when to calm down but at the end of the day this is definetly some strong, good and interesting work. Still, i can see why a lot of people make fun out of them! Overall, their are 4 really good pieces on this album, yet it is let down big time by \"Three Fates\" and \"Tank\". I think this album just scrapes 4 stars."

The difference that Lake and Palmer make to Emerson makes the sound streets ahead of anything that the Nice did. The opener, Barbarian, starts procedings and is a quasi classical piece with a jazzy interlude. Take a pebble is a beautiful song with an extended piano section. Knife Edge is a good enough tune, but I've tired of it a little now. Side 2 opens with The Three Fates which is basically another Emerson workout, followed by Tank when its Palmers turn. I love Tank, always did, and I love the drum solo, from then on the drums were the instrument for me. Tank fails for me when the music returns after the solo, its a bit weak and weedy! Luck Man brings up the rear and its as fine a Lake song there is, complete with debut Moog solo at the end, which I guess is a spine tingle moment for most ELP fans."

You get all the classic ELP elements tossed together and made into a mix that cannot be replicated. The album opens with The Barbarian, and it has easily one of the greatest intoductions I have ever heard, the distorted bass gives a great intro into truly one of the best Instrumentals in Progressive Rock. What you also get with this album is Keith Emerson playing his over zealous, incredibly intricate organ lines, making the feeling that he plays with Boxing Gloves. The next track, Take a Pebble, has all the elements of progressive gold, intricate bass, clever and catchy piano, intuitive and subtle drumming, and a great acoustic break. Knife Edge also carries on the same greatness that Take a Pebble has, great overall playing. The Three Fates is a Keith Emerson Keyboard solo that takes form in three types, Organ, Grand Piano, and what he calls a \"Piano Trio\". Tank is a Carl Palmer drum solo that is in the same vein as \"Moby Dick\" by Led Zeppelin and \"Toad\" by Cream. It begins with the entire group playing intricate lines, then the drums take the forefront and Carl Palmer shows everybody why he is considered one of the best drummers around. The album closer is often considered one of the best ELP songs around. Lucky Man has very tasteful guitar, and some very well written lyrics. The only gripe I have with it is Keith Emerson's solos, they just don't fit with the acoustics. And Carl Palmer's drumming is a little sloppy when he comes out of the drum fills. Overall, this album is a great debut. I recommend it highly."

Emerson's playing is, as always, spectacular. Also, Lake has one of the best voices in all of music. The songs are all coherent and go well together. Personnal favorites include The Barbarian, Knife's Edge, and the aforementioned Tank. Knife's Edge is particularly great. Such passion is used in Greg's singing, and the bands performance. Truely a great piece of music. There are, however, a few moments that keep this album from being five stars. For example, The Three Fates. Parts of this song are dull and unexciting. Also, the second \"part\" of Take A Pebble. I find this to be uninspiered, and it drags the song down. Despite these moments, this is really a solid album. Less pretenous than the rest of catelogue and not to be overlooked."

          "text": "In the mid-Seventies it took a while before I started to appreciate the sumptuous progrock from ELP. It's also totally different from the music from Genesis that I appreciated in the Seventies. But gradually I got into the virtuosic progrock and Keith Emerson, the 'Jimi Hendrix of the progressive rock', became one of my progrock heroes. His keyboardplay is so impressive, on this album I like the church-organ sound, the sparkling piano-runs, the fat Moog sound, what a stunning sound and what a sensation it must have been to hear this music in those days! The interplay between the three musicians is breathtaking (\"Take a pebble\" and \"Knife edge\" are timeless masterpieces) although Carl Palmer is not my favorite drummer, a matter of taste. Very special was the mellow song \"Lucky man\" because of the melancholic climate, the warm vocals from Greg Lake and the spectacular finale, based upon a perfectly build-up Moog synthesizer solo, even inventor Bob Moog was highly impressed! ESSENTIAL!!"

          "text": "This is a true masterpiece debut album! I like the more aggressive and artistic symphonic material which this band managed to create, but sadly many of their albums don't reach their full potential they could have managed to do. Luckily their fist album does it. The opener \"The Barbarian\" has quite cool fuzz bass on it, and it's a transition of BELA BART\ufffdK's piece. The following \"Take A Pebble\" is one of the most perfect progressive ballads. It's long, full of acoustic musical solo scores, which drift pleasantly from an idea to another like a summer day's dream. \"Knife-Edge\" brings back the violent moods with raw sounds, good riffs and fine rhythms. Two next numbers are solo scores, \"The Three Fates\" is for Keith and \"Tank\" for Carl. The drum solo is a difficult task, and this isn't very exiting, but OK performance still. \"Lucky Man\" is then Greg's composition, an acoustic ballad with weird synthesizers. As a total, these tracks create a real classic album!"

It still sounds fresh when listening today because the excesses of Keith Emerson are minimal here and Greg Lake is in full condition after leaving KING CRIMSON. Recommended even to those who don't like ELP."

          "text": "Incredible album which I would have tagged as a five-star masterpiece if it wasn't for one track. The album starts off with \"The Barbarian\", a dark and brooding piece of instrumental rock that kicks off the disc with gusto. Track two, \"Take A Pebble\" to me is their \"Moonchild\". A song that starts off very nicely with Greg Lake's beautiful voice and acoustic guitar but drifts into nothingness before returning to the beginning. Being the longest track on the album, it's just streched out for no reason, (did we really need to hear hand clapping?). Ahh, but the next track, \"Knife-Edge\" is classic ELP. Heavy organ and bass and singing from Greg from the netherworld. It rocks! A perfect prog song to blast from your car speakers with the windows down. How about that synthesizer bridge two minutes in. Awesome! A bonafide classic 5 minute prog song. \"The Three Fates\" is a showcase for Keith starting with the organ in part one, then the piano (I enjoy his piano work more than his organ), then the band joins in for part three. \"Tank\" is an excellent instrumental which showcases Palmer's drum playing. Very nice. Finally, the hit \"Lucky Man\" which includes, if you ask me, the most famous Moog solo/fade out in rock history. I'm not the biggest ELP fan, but you must admit after listening to this album that it's a fantastic first album with their best still to come. 3.75/4 stars"

          "text": "Emerson, Lake & Palmer were progressive rock's first 'super group', and their first album historically is a must have for prog rock fans. Musically, its merit is a bit more dubious. This album is enjoyable, but really just sets the table for ELP's much better works over the next three years. EMERSON LAKE & PALMER is mostly instrumental, and showcases Keith Emerson's brilliant keyboards playing. This is very much a heavy Organ and Drums affair, even flirting with hard rock, but Greg Lake manages to add enough soft touches to save this from being solely a Hammond Organ album. The album was an instant success, hitting number #4 in the UK and #18 in America (quite a feat, riding on the successful single Lucky Man).The album opens with an ominous tone, with \"The Barbarian\". This song features mainly the distorted (fuzzbox) organ of Emerson with some good drumming and excellent Bass lines from Lake. This piece is an (initially uncredited) adaptation of a composition by Romanian composer Bartok, and is an ambitious opening for the group. It is a very good dark instrumental in which each member shines and they really lay out their vision for the band. The next track is somewhat weaker. \"Take a Pebble\" starts off with rippling piano chords by Emerson and delicate percussion setting a soft but surreal mood. Greg Lake's voice enters the track, with typical pretentious ELP lyrical nonsense. It sounds good though. After the vocals we get some more piano, which is very good, but after this the piece deteriorates rapidly. This is ELP's first real 'Suite', and they have not yet mastered transitions between sections, so this piece comes of as rather disjointed, awkward and clumsy. It alternates between jazz piano from Emerson, too bizarre acoustic guitar and hand clapping. This goes on for a bit, and the music just kind of wonders with no real direction (reminiscent of KC another reviewer pointed out). It eventually closes out with the initial vocal melody full of typical ELP bombast. This is a very weak track in need of serious editing, and was utilized much better in the form of a medley with other more acoustic ballads. Luckily the next track an ELP classic, \"Knife Edge\", which adapts Janacek's Sinfonietta for Orchestra, Opus 60. This piece is similar to \"The Barbarian\", but is much more successful, featuring great vocals and decent lyrics from Lake. The piece even has a Fugue for piano in the middle, a real highlight. The repetition of the organ melody is excellent, coming directly after Lake's vocals. The next track is the worst, in my opinion, on the album. \"three Fates\" is really nothing more than a pure showcase for Emerson on piano and church organ. This piece technically is excellent but is completely devoid of emotion, and comes off as a rather good demonstration of talent, but not compositional skill. It plods along, but never picks up steam. The album closes strongly with two excellent tracks. \"Tank\" serves as Carl Palmer's showcases, and features on of the few drum solos on a studio album that works, and does not come off as overly indulgent. This is also the first real appearance of Keith Emerson's famed Moog work, which would have a much more prominent role in later albums. It sounds a bit dated now, but must have been spectacular in 1970. The album ends with the Lake ballad, \"Lucky Man\", a song Greg Lake wrote when he was 12. The song was included as filler, and surprisingly became ELP's first hit. It received decent airplay in the US. It is similar to much of Lake's other acoustic work, and features an excellent Moog solo by Emerson, taken in one take. The lyrics are some of the best Lake has written, telling the story of a warrior who lives an excellent life, and then dies. The story comes off as rather silly here, but is excecuted quite well, and makes a fitting end to the album.While ELP's 1970 debut is weaker than some of their other material, it is an incredibly brave, progressive and successful debut album, showcasing the collective talents of each member, who really were the cream of the crop. This album is highly recommended for historical significance to prog. It is also recommended to those who want the grit and talent of ELP without dealing with an abundance of synthesizers and pretension. 4 STARS."

          "text": "4.5 StarsThe first and their best album. Here it sounds fresh and very progressive while the following albums, it sounds like more of the same (except the groundbreaking Tarkus). Keith Emerson is easily one of the best keyboardists ever to exist, Greg Lake is a great singer/bass player and can play some mean guitar, and Carl Drummer is one of the best Drummers to exist. The problem with the band is that they are not good songwriters at all.BARBARIAN (9/10) kicks off the album with a very good start .. it is a very hard rocker dominated by brilliant hammond organ playing all over the song, it is followed by TAKE A PEBBLE (8.5/10) which starts with one of the most gorgeous vocal performances ever, and is followed by a good ELP jam. KNIFE EDGE (8.5/10) is an ELP classic, and it contains a songwriting style that reminds me of Black Dog (Zeppelin) .. all musicians shine here. The next song is \"THREE FATES\" (8/10) which is a good showcase of Emerson's talents, then CArl Palmer shows his talents in TANK (8.5/10) which is an ELP jam with old synths and a drum solo. The album ends with easily the best song of the album LUCKY MAN (9/10) which is a perfect pop song with one of the most exciting moog solos to ever appear on a record. It is also the first moog solo to ever appear on a record, making this song legendary.I highly recommend this album for anyone, yet it is no masterpiece.My Grade : A/B"

          "text": "A debut album from one of legendary progressive rock heroes. Greg Lake who was previously a bass player and singer for another legendary bandKing Crimsonfinally accepted Keith Emerson (exThe Nice) to form a new band. These two gentlemen met in San Francisco backstage at a show featuring both The Nice and King Crimson. During that meeting they did a lot of talking and followed-up their ideas when they came back to England. [1]. The early formation of ELP happened at the same time when King Crimson's recording of second album \"In The Wake of Poseidon\" at the Wessex Studios.When ELP finally got into gear, Lake did not return to Wessex Studios which left one track - the ballad \"Cadence and Cascade\" - without a vocal. For this Fripp contacted Gordon Haskell, hisl old schoolfriend who had no particular liking of Crimson's music but for a session fee of \ufffd50 was happy to come to Wessex and sing.[2]. Indeed, King Crimson's leader and guitarist Robert Fripp never considered Greg Lake as bass player. He's wrong as we know that Lake plays excellent bass guitar with ELP.Carl Palmer became a member ofThe Crazy World of Arthur Brownat the peak of their popularity. Returning from an 18-month American tour, Carl and Crazy World organist Vincent Crane split to formAtomic Rooster. Musically akin to The Nice, Atomic Rooster was Palmer's first real success as a band founder, and it took some persuading from Greg to convince 20-year-old Carl to leave the band and cement the ELP lineup in 1970. And . JRENG! Finally, what would later be a famous band was formed! And their debut album Emerson Lake and Palmer took the music industry by the storm.This album features six tracks including a song adapted from Bela Bartok's \"Allegro Barbaro\" (The Barbarian) and another song adapted from Janacek's \"Sinfonletta\" (Knife- Edge). The album starts off with a distorted music which brings Keith Emerson's dazzling organ / synthesizer combined with dynamic drum by Carl and bass by Greg. It continues to Greg's nice ballad \"Take A Pebble\" which features great piano work by Keith and melodic vocal line by Greg - reminiscent his style with King Crimson's \"Epitaph\". What comes after is a kind like improvisation music blending Keith rapid-fire piano work, Greg inventive bass playing and Carl drumming (mostly with high hats and toms). The long interlude part explores the piano solo nicely. \"Knife-Edge\" - which later became an ELP staple - continues with accentuated voice line, dynamic bass line combined with organ and drum.\"The Three Fates\" that contains three parts starts with a long sustain and multi layer organ solo with some classical music influence (Royal Festival Hall Organ). It continues with piano solo, broken down into two parts. This track is explorative in nature, written by Keith Emerson. \"Tank\" is another legendary track ELP has ever produced; containing Carl Palmer's excellent drum solo. The album concludes with a simple ballad written by Greg Lake \"Lucky Man\".It's a promising debut album that proved to be the hallmark of ELP's subsequent follow- ups\" \"Tarkus\", \"Pictures At An Exhibition\", \"Trilogy\", \"Brain Salad Surgery\". It's a must for any prog music lover.Keep on proggin' ..!Peace on earth and mercy mild - GWReferences: [1]. \"The Return of The Manticore\" ELP box set sleeve [2]. \"In The Court of King Crimson\", Sid Smith, Helter Skelter Publishing, 2003."

          "text": "A monstrous achievement, so far above anything Emerson did with the Nice it can't come as anything but a revelation. The dated psychedelic predilections and silly joke songs of the Nice were long gone. Moog synthesizer was in and, for 1970, this must have sounded very fresh and modern. This was not the first rock album to use a Moog, but it was probably the first one to really integrate it as a rock & roll instrument, as opposed to a mere sound effect or gimmick. The fire it brings to \"Knife-Edge\" and \"Tank\" is undeniable, and the textures on \"Lucky Man\" are, of course, the stuff of legend.But the Moog is not over-used. Emerson is still all about the Hammond, and applies what he learned in the Nice to stunning effect on \"The Barbarian\" and the aforementioned \"Knife-Edge\". He gets the opportunity to lavish some absolutely heavenly piano work on Lake's feature-length ballad \"Take A Pebble\".Most of the album sounds as though it could have been recorded live; the exception being \"The Three Fates\", which opens with a pipe organ solo and closes with Emerson playing three pianos at once, thanks to the magic of multi-track recording. There's even some Hohner Clavinet on \"Tank\". In all, this is practically an aural reference book for prog-rock keyboard players.Easily the peak of Emerson's career as a keyboardist and ELP's as a group simultaneously. For once in their life, the mating of rock and the classics seemed like a vital thing, rather than the campy kitsch it became on ensuing attempts. I think song selection (pieces by Bart\ufffdk and Janacek) has a lot to do with that. Choosing pieces that work well as rock songs as opposed to, \"Recognize this piece? Ha ha, aren't we clever!\"The most underrated ELP album for me, and also the best. Plays to all of the band's strengths and none of its weaknesses (I'll be kind this time and turn a blind eye to the drum solo in \"Tank\"). They'd never be so consistently inspired again."

          "text": "I love ELP, nevertheless I think this is their only really perfect album. As much as I love the others (at least those up to \"Welcome Back My Friends...\"), to be honest I have to admit there's always something missing, unlike, for instance, in albums such as \"Wish You Were Here\" or \"In the Court of the Crimson King\". However, this is not the case of ELP's eponymous debut: a bold, bombastic, in-your-face statement of intent, a prog masterpiece the band have been able to better in all their chequered career.When the record originally came out, its two sides were divided between 'group' efforts on the first and tracks showcasing the individual prowess of the three band members on the second. ELP took up the same idea in their 1977 \"Works vol.1\" double album, only much less successfully. Everything begins in style with one of my all-time favourite instrumental tracks, the magnificent \"The Barbarian\", a reworking of Bela Bartok's \"Allegro Barbaro\", an extremely heavy triumphal march driven by Palmer's drumming and Emerson's Hammond, complete with booming gong to signal the end of the quieter section and the reprise of the main theme. After that, things couldn't get more different with Lake's haunting, wistful ballad \"Take a Pebble\", undoubtedly one of his best vocal performances, with lovely piano and acoustic guitar in the middle section. \"Knife Edge\" is a rockier song that draws again upon a piece of classical music (this time it's Janacek's \"Sinfonietta\"), featuring beautiful Hammond work by Emerson and menacing, almost snarling vocals by Lake.The second side sees Emerson's three-part tour de force, \"The Three Fates\", where he plays a real organ in the majestic \"Clotho\", before laying into his piano for \"Lachesis\" and \"Atropos\". Palmer's showcase, the intricate and heavily percussive \"Tank\", follows, and Lake's Top Ten ballad \"Lucky Man\" (which, as everybody now knows, he wrote at 12) brings the album to a close. Though I've never been particularly fond of this song, I cannot deny its attractiveness, enhanced by Emerson's Moog solo a the end. However, as Lake's ballads go, I very much prefer \"From the Beginning\" and especially the much- maligned \"Still...You Turn Me On\". I agree that ELP may not be to everyone's taste, but I also think no self-respecting progger's record collection could be considered complete without at least this one album. As to myself, this is definitely one of my Top Ten favourites in any kind of genre."

An older cousin lent me this album then, and also other albums like ELP`s \"Brain Salad Surgery\" and others.Maybe the band was still trying to create their own identity in sound in this album, but there are very good songs like \"The Barbarian\", \"Take a Peeble\" (with a very good piano), \"Knife Edge\" (with a great \"Baroque music\" organ arrangement), \"Three Fates\" (with the use of a church organ) and \"Lucky Man\" (maybe the most known song of this album). The music in this album is maybe less interesting than \"Tarkus\", \"Trilogy\" and \"Brain Salad Surgery\", but it was a very good start for this band, IMO."

          "text": "The band Emerson, Lake and Palmer are arguably the first ever prog super group, comprising of members from already established British progressive groups. Keith Emerson was from The Nice, Greg Lake of King Crimson and Carl Palmer of Atomic Rooster, these three musicians joined together to create Emerson, Lake and Palmer, or simply ELP. The guys decided to name the band after each member's last names as they were all well-known musicians and this would grant the band immediate recognition. Luckily, something good came out of this supergroup in their debut album\" Emerson, Lake and Palme\"r which was the first in a string of successful albums. \" Lucky Man\" in particular was very successful and ELP gained a foothold so to speak on the musical public.The album opener \"The Barbarian\" is quite a heavy song as far as this band goes, entirely instrumental and almost completely dominated by Keith Emerson's moogs and other Synthesizers. Parts of said song are very swift and display great virtuosity from all members, but especially from Carl Palmer whose percussion is a driving force in this number. Following \"The Barbarian\" is \"Take A Pebble\" which originated as a poem and then as a blues tune written initially by Greg Lake. The song was taken and literally stretched out to around 12 minutes, in which Emerson and Greg Lake play solo on the piano and guitar respectively. When the \"pebbles drop\" a fast pace instrumental section beings which then leads into an ending much like the beginning of the piece.The calm brought on by \"Take a Pebble\" is completely thrown out the window with the next track, \"Knife-Edge. \"\"Knife Edge\" is quite a loud song with heavy keyboard, percussion and bass guitar lines. The lyricism of \"Knife-Edge\" is very catchy and the bass guitar echoing in the back round complements the vocals very well. The addition of instrumental interludes between vocal sections gives the song a, kind of repetitious feel. The band was taken to court over a keyboard section \"borrowed\" from a 20th centaury composer's song. Luckily the dispute was solved out of court and royalties were payed to the composer's family. Next is \"The Three Fates\", a song completely dominated by Keith Emerson.until the last two or so minutes when the whole band comes out with all guns firing.Next is another instrumental called \"Tan\"k which begins immediately with swift percussion from Palmer and thrumming bass guitar, which is soon joined by Emerson playing the main tune over the top. Carl Palmer's percussion solo in the middle of the song leads to another violent fusion of synthesizers, bass and percussion which in tern ends the song. Finally we come to \"Lucky Man\", which is probably ELP's most famous song. It's basically about a rich, lucky man who goes to war and dies. Acoustic guitar makes up the general feel of the song, with an electric guitar solo in the middle. The good-stuff comes towards the end of the song when Emerson plays probably the most memorable moog-solo in all prog. Great stuff.1.The Barbarian (4/5) 2.Take a Pebble (4/5) 3.Knife-Edge (4/5) 4.The Three Fates (3.5/5) 5.Tank (3/5) 6.Lucky Man (5/5) Total = 23.5 divided by 6 = 3.916 = 4 stars Excellent addition to any prog music collectionELP may not everyone's cup of tea, and many people dislike ELP with a bloody passion, but this album is one which everyone can enjoy along with 'Brain Salad Surgery.' This is real classic progressive rock, it doesn't come more genuine than this my friends. I'd recommend this album to everyone who enjoys classic 70's symphonic prog and fans of Yes, Genesis and to a lesser extent King Crimson should enjoy this album among the band's others."

          "text": "Even arriving a little later than King Crimson, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull and others to the progressive scene, EL&P is doubtlessly one of the\"Giants\". Well, their members were all in a way or another involved with prog-rock and the likes for some time then when the trio appeared. They are also called the first prog super-group exactly due to the previous musical contacts and experiences of Keith EMERSON, Greg LAKE and Carl PALMER. Uh, too many epithets for a bunch of three men and what about the music?EL&P were a very popular band in early 70s (not only for prog, but for the entire rock genre) who saw their prestige diminish since then except for some resurgent appearances, material re-issues and compilation releases. Unlike other 1st class bands which settled their record material on their own compositions, EL&P rotated around old erudite authors giving their opus new clothes and approaches. Yes, they produced their own stuff too, but the entire atmosphere sounded clearly imbedded in theclassics. In a span of few years, the scheme aged just when prog-rock was suffering its adulthood pains and the general audience was aiming to less contemplative and qualified genres, led by label managers and media promoters, not counting the excesses and pretentiousness of prog spearheads (EL&P amidst them) that initially amused/amazed the public only to leave a boring feeling as long as time goes by.Band self-titled first studio album is a fair effort, although unbalanced, with orchestral-like extravaganzas dwelling together with simple chord arrangements and with classical based songs joined by virtuoso keyboard exhibitions opposing soft and cool ballads. General production is half-way mainly if compared with band's output in years to come. The ever-present sensation is that for their first party together, members brought their own home-made liquors.\"The barbarian\", the opening track, is a powerful beginning, reminding King Crimson's openings in their two first albums, being the great difference the absence of a singing segment, which could be even more noticed since the singer is the same either for Crimson and EL&P, the notorious Greg Lake. The song is credited for the triad but in fact is based on a Bartok piece namedAllegro Barbaroand it sounds like an introducing card of band's philosophy.\"Take a pebble\" has all the progressive spices we all pleasantly admire and consequently grabs the honor of being the best album's track. Lake's voice is superb, Emerson's piano solo and accompaniment is glorious and Palmer does rightly his work here. After the smooth balladesque intro we hear a very bucolic and sometimes psychedelic guitar passage mixed with folk backings that gives room to the mentioned piano part broken only by drums and bass tunes, the effect is magnificent, a great prime mover of the prog-rock style. Song closure returns to the ballad part with a slightly different touch which is very convenient.\"Knife edge\", a song based on a Janacek composition, starts nervous and almost frenzy bearing the typical troika keyboards-drums-bass playing that should be a kind of band's signature. The following track, \"The three fates\" has a disturbing organ sounding a bit non-sense. Piano part is much more appreciable even resembling the previous track. The song leaps in quality when the band acts like a real combo. \"Tank\" has a rehearsal atmosphere which may have sounded fair when played live, however the final result is poor bordering asleep state.Final track, \"Lucky man\" is probably the most commercial feature in band's career. While the song is hearable and agreeable, it breaches totally album's nature and its inclusion was initially rejected - what an irony! The now famous and recognized moog ending was improvised and player Keith Emerson wasn't satisfied, although he probably changed his mind when the coins erupted in his wallet.As a first effort by EL&P, we should say that the this album is above average with prospects for higher flights (and that was the perspective back in 1970). Splendid \"Take a pebble\" track responds for the rating increases fromgoodtoessential. Total: 4."

But there's not really that much to fear about; yes, there's still dissonance, but it's digestable. A fault that many people find in this band is the lack of guitar. Lake fortunately fixes the problem, even if he doesn't do any \"Steve Howe\" or \"Steve Hillage\" (whichever suits better), he gets the job done effectively in both electric and acoustic. The guitar is still not omnipresent though.\"The Barbarian\" starts the album with a faithful reworking of Bartok's \"Allegro Barbaro\", even if it differs in format, substantially is the same feel.\"Take A Pebble\" is a Lake's composition, and it has Emerson trying to jazz things up, as the verse-chorus-solo fades, we're brought to a southern folksy passage with claps, and then Emerson sets the mark again for a jazz improvisation. After all that, we get back to the main theme. Although it might seem a bit stretched at first, it grows on you. I liked it on first listen.I really didn't care for \"Knife Edge\"; I find it cheesy in arrangements, and even if I haven't heard Janacek's piece, I don't think he'll be too happy to hear this. The song's melody is strong nonetheless.\"The Three Fates\" is for me the best opus on this album. It's mostly a showcase for Emerson alone, although the rest of the band enters at some point. The suite sets off with haunting organ chords that fits more in \"Atropos\" than in \"Clotho\" (past and present, respectively), but it doesn't matter. Lachesis is a grand piano segment very much in the vein of a true classical pianist, and yet it really evokes at some point a \"warp to the future\" (ironically enough). \"Atropos\" welcomes the entire trio to the piece and Palmer's beat is amazing here.\"Tank\" might be seen as a continuation of \"The Three Fates\" in which Lake employs vibrato in the bass notes at the beginning.\"Lucky Man\" is the pop song of the album. Terribly spoiled by the Moog solo in the middle, which by now sounds awfully dated.All in all, I still think that this album is an excellent addition to every progressive far, even if brought down by 0.5 stars."

          "text": "Maybe the most \"normal\" of the ELP \"elite\" records.Take that comment as you wish. Some will praise this record for maybe being the most sane, others will complain because it wasn't pompous enough. For me this has a very significant connection to King Crimson's first work primarily because of Lake's presence during the time period (released in back to back years).This album was surprisingly heavy, to me anyways. It's also got plenty of moments of virtuosity, which although might not be thought as such by some of today's elite, but certainly was for its time. The biggest problem I have with the record is a lack of balance and lack of identity. I hear ELP catering to many different audiences, as if to attract more listeners, but no definitive sound throughout. While such decisions may have helped them reach a broader audience, I am of the opinion that they are wasted and dull tracks which only serve to hurt the impact the record might otherwise have.For example, the rhyming lyrics in The Knife is pain to listen to, it's just awful poetry; maybe Ian Anderson could have helped them with some snazzy lines. I would say Three Fates is the best listen here, along with Barbarian. ELP certainly was one of the most experimental of early prog bands, and an extremely innovative band. This is a nice little start, and would be the best place to begin for those more accustomed to the other \"big\" symphonic prog acts."

          "text": "I was in my very early 20s when this album came out in 1970. But I was in no way, shape or form able at that time to fully appreciate the brilliance of the revolutionary music of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. (I dare say I wasn't alone among my peers in my immaturity, though.) I'm not telling you that I didn't become an instant fan or that I didn't enjoy it. On the contrary. It's just that I probably lifted the needle over the very best parts a hundred times in order to get to the \"heavier\" stuff that the headbanger in me craved. It's only in the many decades since then that I have come to understand just how amazing and timeless this album is. First things first, however. I have to point out the fact that the painting on the cover by Nic Dartnell is one of the all-time classics. But you already knew that.\"The Barbarian\" is a perfect four and a half minute introduction to ELP. They throw everything at you including a fuzz bass and a very intense, snarling organ from Keith Emerson. His piano interlude midway through is exhilarating and soon you know you are in the presence of a truly gifted keyboard virtuoso. \"Take a Pebble\" is one of those songs I would jump over in my youth but I was only cheating myself by doing that. Greg Lake's distinctive voice starts things off singing a nice melody with simple lyrics about how each individual act can have a rippling effect on one's entire life. Emerson's piano takes over and literally takes your breath away. Then comes a folksy acoustic guitar segment from Lake that is gentle and spacious, ending with handclaps and whistles as if they were sitting around a campfire. Next you get another dose of wonderful piano alongside Carl Palmer's jazzy drums before Lake finishes the song with another poignant vocal. \"Knife Edge\" more than satisfies the hard rock monster in us all with its hard, piercing organ and gutsy vocal over some very strong drums. And the cool meltdown ending is just what the doctor ordered. There's no excuse for my years of skipping over the apex of the album, \"The Three Fates.\" What was I thinking? Just testosterone-fueled impatience, I guess. The enormous sound of the Royal Festival Hall Organ is magnificent and the piece, \"Clotho,\" would be right at home in a gladiator movie soundtrack. And I mean that in a good way, too. It is epic in scope. Emerson next treats you to \"Lachesis,\" a truly outstanding solo piano composition and performance that blew away 99.9% of the keyboard players in rock at that time. It is nothing short of awesome. After a brief return to the cathedral organ the drums enter and Palmer and Emerson go into the stirring 7/8 time \"Atropos\" that would impress even the great Gershwin. It's fantastic. \"Tank\" is probably the least remarkable track here but that's only because of the obligatory (at that time) drum solo contained within. Even then the clavinet at the beginning and the Moog noodlings at the end are intriguing. All this being said about the album, if it wasn't for Lake's ironic anti-war anthem \"Lucky Man\" it's debatable as to whether the group would have attained the huge success that was to come. This song got them noticed. It's a very catchy ditty to begin with and Greg's unique voice is a definite plus but it was Emerson's Moog rising like a phoenix toward the latter part of the tune that made everybody reach over and crank up the volume on their radio. It wasn't the first time the public had heard this new instrument but it was the first time it was the STAR OF THE SHOW and even the most conservative listener couldn't get enough of it.The high fidelity of the sound is surprising until you notice that the engineer was none other than Eddie Offord (who would go on to produce most of Yes' finest albums). In particular, the piano sounds so crisp and clear it's like it's in the room with you. So, if you haven't procured a copy of this cornerstone of progressive rock by now, do yourself a favor and add it to your collection. It is unquestionably one of the greatest debut albums ever and the music is still as fresh and relevant today as it was when it first appeared on the record shelves. Just don't be like me and skip over the best parts."

          "text": "For the record I love ELP. I can still remember going to see them play live in 1972 at the Long Beach arena in Southern California knowing nothing of their music except Lucky Man. I came out of there stunned. Being a piano player I was completely blown away that Keith Emerson had replaced the guitar with his keyboards as the main focus of the music. So of course I went out the next day (or maybe it was the next time I had money. Fuzzy memory there. Well it was the 70's) and purchased all three ELP studio releases.I listed to them over and over. I still pull out this occasionally anfd I still listen to the whole albuim when I do. To me that is a mark of a classic. What strikes me first is the willingness of the group having such a great singer is producing so many instrumental songs. The Barbarian, Tank, Three Fates and the middle section of Take a Pebble make up for way more than half the album. Starting with t he Barbarian the band is stating to you this is no acoustic guitar singer album. They smash you in the face with an almost metal like violence. Then they turn 180 degrees to the acoustic Take A pebble with it's brilliant vocal and romantic piano lines, then turn back to the thunder with Knife Edge. The Three Fates show off Keith's side as a classical composer moving through three movements with varying intensity and instrumentation. Tank finds us in awe of Carl Palmer's drumming prowess until they leave us with Lucky Man kind of swaying pub song you might sing while drinking with your friends.Great album on progs earliest examples by three excellent musicians. It was one of my earliest introduction to what would become a long line of great keyboard players. 5 stars."

          "text": "ELP. Three letters which evokes all the extravaganza and exhuberence you can think of. They have been categorized as pompous, pretentious, bombastic. What is for sure is that those three guys are very gifted. Each of them playing his intrument (s) very well. To decide to not include a guitar player in their line-up in those days was rather bold.The opener \"The Barbarian\" is a true ELP song. Every aspect of their personality is represented here. It is a kaleidoscope of what ELP will produce durin the decades to come. One of my all time fave. Powerful, violent and bombastic. This is how I love ELP. This trio is extremely powerful, delivering incredible sounds thanks to each one's virtuosity.\"Take A Pebble\" is a showcase for Lake and Emerson. I quite like Lake's very smooth tone of voice; quiet, discreet, almost tranquil. His bass play in the first part of the song is really impressive. The song will evolve into a classic piece during which he will play a very subtle acoustic guitar piece. It is a very slow part, almost silent. Emerson will take up around the middle of the song, as if each has to have the lead on his own.This will probably affect the cohesion of the band sometimes (cf. Works). Each member playing his part to shine. I do not know if it was a compromise between them or just a fact that arose between them. The last section of the song, is quite jazzy and sounds more as an improvisation. Some nice drumming work as well during this part. IMO, this number lacks in cohesion : no real leading strand.\"Knife Edge\" is a difficult number, its dark mood reminds me of KC. It is a powerful track, like the opener. We are far from the subtility of \"Take A Pebble\". This track clearly announces \"Tarkus\". It also has all the typical ingredients of a classic ELP track. The trio is sensational : to combine such pieceful (almost religious) music with the heaviest one without transition is a remarkable tour de force. Keith is hitting his keys like a savage. Really good.The pompous side of the band is clearly illustrated in the intro of \"The Three Fates\" : sounds like the entry of the gladiators in the arena. Could have been the sountrack of a peplum of the sixties (Wakeman will also sound like that from time to time). These three movements are purely there to push Keith on the front line. This track is a bit annoying. It is again a real band track during the last third of it. Great percussion work again from Carl.\"Tank\" is, during the intro sounds more like a combination from the band. It confirms their maestria as a band but inevitably since he was somewhat discreet so far, this number will be the opportunity for Carl to be on the foreground. Great drumming (with a short solo) from one of the greatest rock drummer (all times, all genres).ELP were short of one song to make a decent lenghty album. So, they were still missing one number. Lake will come with a very old number he wrote while he was twelve (if I remember correctly). It will lead to this very nice little piece of music. The lightest on this album, and even if Lake is of course the frontman here, the band is wonderful in its complementarity. I like that song very much (even after such a long time).This is a very good debut album for the band. Of course these musicians have already played with big names before so it is not really their debut. What frustrates me on this album, but this is an ELP trademark, is the habit from the E, the L and the P to play each one's part as being more important as the performance of the whole. At least it sounds like this to my ears. Having said this, this album gets all the ELP quintessence. There are no weak numbers, it displays already what the band will produce later on and is, IMO, one of the best they will produce.Four stars."

I consider ELP to be the drunken frat-boys of progressive rock, since many of their later albums feature ecclectic (and overrated) songs which are neither very progressive or exciting; however, \"ELP\" is short and sweet, showcasing the band's legitimate talent with a classy set of songs that are a perfect example of the early '70's progressive sound.The heavy opening of the instrumental \"Barbarian\" starts things off great, while the soft textures and smoothness of Lake's vocals in \"Take a Pebble\" really demonstrate the band's range. \"ELP\" is heavy on instrumentals, but since each member of the trio is outstanding at what they do that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Highly recommended to the very few people reading this who don't already have it!Songwriting: 4 Instrumental Performances: 4 Lyrics/Vocals: 4 Style/Emotion/Replay: 4"

          "text": "ELP's debut is, for many, their best and it stands as one fo the finest debuts in prog. Prog rock's first supergroup wasted no time placing themselves at the top of the burgeoning heap, and they would go on to become more popular that Genesis and Yes in the early years. The members brought with them mastery of their respective instruments and would make some defining records. Keith Emerson is the only man who could ever outplay Rick Wakeman. Lake brings his wonderful voice as his incredible bass skill, as well as high competence with a guitar. The stand out, however, is Carl Palmer, who plays the most technical drumming that had ever been heard at that point.\"The Barbarian\" opens the album with heavy bass and organ from Lake and Emerson before mellowing out for a bit with piano, then coming back fiercer than ever. It's one of the more enjoyable ELP instrumentals, and it sets teh stage for the high musicianship of the album, especially Carl. \"Take a Pebble\" features Keith messing with the strings of a piano before playing liek a normal person (if you can call his phenomenal skill \"normal\"). Lake's voice is incredible, as is his bass. Emerson has some great improv in this song. \"Knife Edge\" is the best song of the album, and it obliterates the tranquility of the last song with crushing heaviness clearly influenced by Lake's stint with Mr. Fripp. This song is really the best glance into what ELP would sound like on the next few albums. Songs like this show how well these guys could gel, and it's a shame that so many of their arrangements serve only one member at a time.For example, \"The Three Fates\" lets Keith show off and \"Tank\" is Carl's drum solo. They are both very good, especially Tank, but it kills the togetherness by having essentailly two solos back to back. \"Lucky Man\" is the pop tune for the album. It's the only ELP pop tune I enjoy; later ballads would lack energy or even decent lyrics.Overall, this is ELP at their rawest. They act like aband, not three separate stars. The next three albums would show ELP conquering the progressive world, until ego and greed got the best of them and they released failure after dismal failure. This remains the only ELP album without filler, and prog fans must have it.Grade: A-"

          "text": "This debut album reveals a very human side of ELP, but it also shows where they were apt to go wrong. The human side is prevalent in the 12-minute-plus 'Take a Pebble'. This tune has simple lyrics and an attractive melody, but it's notable for its extended piano improvisation. Emerson may not be in the same league as Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett or similar virtuosi, but he is fun to listen to, and the interplay with his fellow musicians runs smoothly. I can't think of any other prog pianists who could have pulled off this sort of thing back in the early seventies - certainly not Rick Wakeman, Tony Banks or John Evan. (Perhaps the pianist from Renaissance? I must admit I don't really know that band...)\"ELP going wrong\" emerges in 'Lucky Man', which would have been a lovely ballad if only it had been sung by someone with true emotion in his voice (love that Moog solo though), and in 'Knife Edge', which is ruined by Lake's clever-clever lyrics. But 'Knife Edge' also demonstrates that Emerson was prog's unmatched Hammond organ hero! I didn't discover ELP until 1975, but back in 1970 this album must have raised great hopes.Rating: two stars and a half."

          "text": "Any normal new band can afford the luxury of making a good even when not great album but ELP not, they were the first Prog Supergroup, with members who came from great bands as The Nice, Arthur Brown and nothing less than King Crimson, so people should expect not only a solid but a mature album and they partially achieve the goal, even when it's evident we're not before one of their masterpieces.The album is very good, saying the contrary would be a lie and unfair, but it's far from being even close to the status of masterpiece. Some tracks are almost perfect but others too simple for them, most are well elaborate but as a whole it's a bit uneven, so without more subjective comments, lets check the songs.\"The Barbarian\" is an adaptation of \"Allegro Barbaro\" by the Romanian composer Bela Bartok, quite an ambitious task, but IMHO they fail, at the beginning you don't know if they remain in the Psychedelic era or trying to make some Classical oriented Hard Rock, then they step closer to Jazz and Neo Classical. If I had to say something positive, the drumming by Carl Palmer is quite impressive but nothing else, yes Keith is very skilled but it seems like not able to find a defined style, loud and frantic, but lost in the middle of nowhere.\"Take a Pebble is a solid improvement, Keith starts scratching the chords of the piano and immediately joins the wonderful voice of Carl Palmer sounding better than ever, absolutely impressive and strong, the piano background is incredibly beautiful, then the instrumental section gets even better, Keith proves how good he is in the piano and Carl makes a perfect subtle jazzy drumming, simply love this track.\"Knife Edge\" is another adaptation, in this case from Sinfonietta by Janacek, the result is amazing this time, Greg's incredible voice helps a lot and they can really Rock while making radical changes, then the instrumental section is Prog at it's best and the organ solo gives me goosebumps, another excellent track that never bores.\"The Three Fates\" simply leaves me cold, seems like Keith lost his path between Rachmaninoff and Debussy and could never find it, it's a pity that the only epic and the best chance they have to demonstrate what they are able is practically wasted, not bad but they were able of much more.\"Tank\" starts solid with Keith making his synth sound as a clavichord, the rhythm section works perfectly with Lake at it's best, but the two minute solo by Carl Palmer is way too much, it may be great in a concert to give the rest of the band time to take a breath and get an ovation, but in a studio album is a waste of time, yes we know Palmer is top notch, but this is not the way to prove it, playing perfectly with the rest of the band is better.After the boring solo, the closing section is also brilliant, Lake is again perfect with the bass and Keith knows what to do when he puts his hands on a Moog, now Palmer does a great job, if there was a way to eliminate the drum solo would be a perfect song, sadly that's not possible so we get a good one and not more.The album ends with the na\ufffdve \"Lucky Man\", yes I know people will say that Greg wrote this song when he was 11 or 12 years old, what is pretty impressive, but he was 23 and Keith three years older when released, so by this moment it was not a so impressive achievement.But being honest, the singing is perfect and every album requires a single and a chance for the audience in the concerts to sing along, so \"Lucky Man\" fulfills it's mission and it's pleasant, at the end the Moog performance by Emerson makes the track much better than the usual acoustic versions sung by the author lately.Now it's time to rate the album, not a masterpiece so 5 stars is out of the table, but now comes the problem, I'm not sure if it's an excellent addition for any Prog Collection and obviously is not essential from my point of view, but it's more than just good.This is one of the cases in which I wish there was half stars to rate it with 3.5, but being impossible, will have to go with 3 very solid and a bit unfair stars."

And you know who that hot chick in the front row went back to the motel room with; it wasn't the keyboard player. Well, Keith Emerson set out to change all of that.The opening shot was the first Emerson Lake and Palmer album (sorry, the Nice stuff, while admirable, doesn't count).The intention is clear right from the beginning: we're a power trio and we don't need no stinkin' guitar player! The Barbarian (never mind that it was an uncredited ripoff of Bartok) is absolutely brutal hard rock. Lake and Palmer -- no strangers to strange bands -- are more than up to challenge. Take a Pebble shows a softer, more contemplative and even experimental side -- I don't think anyone had played a piano zither-style before. Then comes Knife-Edge, which is more flat-out, take-no-prisoners hard rock. Emerson and the band are shoving it down your throat.With these three songs Emerson forever changed what would be expected of a rock keyboard player. It was no longer enough to be some competent mellotron player (e.g., Moody Blues), or organ power chord purveyor (e.g., Jon Lord of Deep Purple). No, you had best bring some chops to the table if you wanted to be counted among the best.What was side two of the LP is a bit of a disappointment. The Three Fates hints at where ELP would eventually end up, and Tank is the obligatory drum bit. But Lucky Man is a great vehicle for Lake, and at the end Emerson lays a little moogie-woogie on the king of rock and roll.The last half of this one runs out of gas, so I'll only give it a 4. However, do not underestimate the importance of this album: proof that a band with no lead guitarist could play devastating hard rock."

It could also be someone's last album, the only album or randomly generated sounds by some aliens, appearing on the Earth in 1970 by a coincidence. It's so unique. Where did these guys came from? Well, we know the story: THE NICE; ARTHUR BROWN; KING CRIMSON, but...where did the ideas originated? Obviously, Keith had a main role here. As a performer and as a composer. Now I know, notallthe material is originally Emerson's, but back then I wasn't familiar with Bart\ufffdk or Jan\ufffd\u010dek. They were not credited, and I heard they had some problems because of that...and as a sidenote, Greg was absolutely unaware of that musical \"borrowings\". I won't comment legal and moral issues - however ELP popularised a contemporary classical music to a wider audience (remember, this was recorded in 1970, when sympho rock was POPular). The album consists of six songs; six different ideas. Hmm, that sounds stupid. Of course they have to be different ideas if they are different songs...but what I'm trying to say is....they were new, fresh band. The direction that band should follow was not clear yet - so they were lost in different paths, different concepts...different ideas. In a word, they lacked focus. From that point of view,this is so typical debut. Of course, what makes a difference is the music. There is no bad song here, they're just all too different. Okay, now we are crossing that tiny line from concept (or lack thereof) to the substance...and here we are, grinded, mutilated by piano keys, stabbed by a church organ, while arpeggios are bleeding and drums are enfilading us.It's that powerful, and more. In the most furious moments (personally, my favourite moment from the album) we have a piano trio, with perverse chord progressions, evil rattlesnake percussion and 7/4 time measure that is vivisection of all things related to madness. On the weakest side, we have poppy folk balladry - which is not bad at all, with its clever usage of text (I dare say ironical). ELP were always touching the subject of battles, wars, madness...and that story started here. In \"Tank\" (sic!) we have detailed picture of a tank and his driver: scared little man, reluctant to go, drives a tank and slowly enters the battlefield as his madness is growing. Great clavinet and bass melodies here are making so plastic, tactile, humid picture of his brain. Drum solois nota show-off for Mr. Palmer; it's a middle of the battlefield, showing as machine guns, cannons and enfilades. The final of the song utilises heavy layers of synths: madness is here. The tank proceeds, but not intact. Blood-red are the eyes of the driver. The tank is advancing and crushing everything in front of him without mercy. Those high-pitched synth solo, don't they sound like weepings and screams? The story has no conclusion, since it's faded. The destiny is to be imagined. The closing song is explicitly criticising the aforementioned topic, plus with the music, the solo at the very end...isn't that the sound of bullet hitting the body? All these pictures will be developed further on, on the albums to come (please see my reviews), but the big idea started here. The debut is inconsistent, innocent, at the moments na\ufffdve. The song themselves are filled with monstrosity. Young, raging brains struggling to explode in all possible directions. How could I dislike it?"

          "text": "Review 1, 1970, Emerson, Lake and PalmerThis self-titled debut is, in my opinion, the progressive supergroup's best. Of the six tracks, only one (Emerson's 'The Three Fates') suffers from any doubtful taste, and even that has a beautiful section. This is an even more astounding accomplishment given the sheer versatility of the music produced: a great folk ballad with a moog solo that never ceases to amuse me, the essential acoustic masterpiece, the heavier Hammond-based Barbarian and Knife Edge, the drumming-dominated Tank, and the various noodlings that comprise The Three Fates. Even though ELP have produced several excellent prog albums, this is the one I'd call essential.Barbarian introduces the trio perfectly, with a growling electric guitar, a superb heavy Hammond organ, and tasteful drumming. The music's constantly shifting, yet retains all its rawness. And suddenly, there's an acoustic section with quirky, yet delightful, piano and drumming. And somehow Emerson escalates that back to the main tune's heaviness flawlessly. And it just gets better and better towards the end. Proof that a progressive masterpiece does not need to be long.Next we have my all-time ELP favourite, Take A Pebble. It's just three musicians on acoustic instruments working together flawlessly, with gorgeous, flowing classical-inspired piano supported by Lake's delicate bass and acoustic guitar parts, tasteful percussion, inspired use of watery sound-effects, strong vocals (most reminiscent of Epitaph) with beautiful surreal lyrics. The band shifts moods between optimism, anticipation, grandeur and surprisingly heavy, dark moods seamlessly. Emotion oozes from the piano and the vocals. There are no weak moments in all the twelve and a half minutes of beautiful music.Third in the album we have another heavier piece, Knife Edge. This took me a little longer to acquire than the previous two songs, but the excellent bass lines, mantra-like, almost-spoken vocals, slightly darker drumming with brief drum solos, and superb build-up and entertaining keyboard riffs and parts ultimately make for a great song. I particularly like the weird churchlike instrumental section in the middle. The lyrics are solid, and work very well with the music. It ends with a slowing-down effect and sort of clicks to a stop. As progressive as Barbarian, and though it doesn't quite reach the heights of the opener, it's still a masterpiece.The Three Fates is a little more mixed. The organ-opener Clotho hasn't really made an impression on me, but it's well worth listening to through to move onto the beautiful piano solo, Lachesis. Delicate, beautiful, tasteful, mobile, and fairly symptomatic of Emerson's piano on the album as a whole. Atropo is another entirely different kettle of fish, with a combination of the instrumentation used earlier in The Three Fates and a little percussion, if I'm not mistaken. The build-up to a final explosion sound effect is quite good, and has a bizarre dramatic atmosphere that goes down quite well. Overall, this track's not quite as good as the rest of the album, but still interesting, at times masterful, and well worth listening to.Tank is another oddity. Bass and drumming paves the way for another flippant keyboard (Moog, I think) part, sustained by the bass and brief bursts of solo drumming leading up to a longer (though not excessive), extremely good drum solo with a real sense of direction that many solos lack. It builds up extremely well and leads into the return of the bass and the moog. Yet another great, charming prog piece.Lucky Man rounds off the album soundly. It's in a much less progressive vein than the rest of the album, but that doesn't really matter to me. The basic melody and the bass part is good, Palmer's drumming complements it nicely, you get to hear more of Lake's voice. And finally, there's a hilarious moog part. Emerson was apparently not taking the solo entirely seriously when he played it, but it's still brilliant. Although it's really more folk than prog, I still love this song.In conclusion, I'm giving this album one of the easiest five star ratings that I'm ever likely to give. I love it. This is ELP at their finest, with electronic and acoustic instrumentation both used to their full effect. Accessible, yet a grower. As much loved as In The Court Of The Crimson King or Selling England By The Pound. Well worth buying, and also a good introduction to the band.Rating: Masterpiece. Five Stars.Favourite Track: Take A Pebble."

I knew this was the complexity and sound I desired for my sort of music. With this album, I loved the brutal fuzz-Bass (on the opener 'The Barbarian'), Hammond Organ/Piano play, also an early display of a Moog synthesizer, fully endorsed by its creator, Dr. Robert Moog....., and for Carl Palmer's beyond 'rock-music' approach to his drum-kit (he did display his amazing dexterity on Atomic Rooster's debut album, particularly on the track 'Decline and Fall'....), so, this record stands as an amazing amalgam of different styles of music, all rolled into one highly attractive and accessible offering on a musically hungry demanding public. Of course, this album came out well before I was born, but, I feel that these sorts of changes were quite revolutionary within music's development.....(please correct me if I'm wrong....). There's been recent evaluations on various ELP albums at this time, and I would just like to support their albums with my honest feelings toward their music. Sure, a 5 star Canterbury album means so much to me, in terms of quality.....but, ELP are totally amazing as well........I can understand why a certain amount of listeners don't dig these guys........"

          "text": "I have been looking forward to making this review as it has been a very long time since I listened to this album the last time and it\ufffds nice to come back with fresh eyes to see if it\ufffds really as good as I rememeber it. This is ELP\ufffds debut album. ELP consists of Keith Emerson ( The Nice) on keyboards, Greg Lake ( King Crimson) on vocals, bass, electric & acoustic guitar and Carl Palmer ( Atomic Rooster) on drums. A kind of supergroup. Both Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer are without a doubt virtuosos on their respective instruments while I have always had a hard time really appreciating Greg Lake\ufffds efforts. He\ufffds a good musician no doubt, but I never felt he was as brilliant as the others. Quite franky I never liked his voice much. It\ufffds hard to explain but it never touched me but it didn\ufffdt annoy me either. It\ufffds just there.The music is rock inspired heavily by classical music. There are only keyboards, bass, drums and vocals in the music but Keith Emerson dominates the soundscape with his keyboards, so you don\ufffdt miss any other instrument. This is truly a power trio. The music is mostly instrumental but there are vocal parts which is of course great for the diversity. There are some really good songs on this debut album and I would mention The Barbarian, Take a Pebble, Knife-Edge and Tank as the highlights of the album while I find The Three Fates to be too much noodling and Lucky Man too commercial.What I enjoy most about this album is the musicianship. Let me just state that it is outstanding and there are several breathtaking moments throughout the album.The sound quality is excellent. One of the best productions from that time.There are many positive things to say about this album and I have mentioned a few, but somehow ELP never really excited me much. Their musicianship has always been the most exciting thing about them while I always found most of their songs to be emotionless compared to other great bands from that time like Genesis, Gentle Giant and Yes. It\ufffds about the same feeling I have always had with King Crimson even though I like them a bit more than ELP. I know this sounds very negative but this is a good album and I do like it more than it sounds like when you read the above lines. I would have rated the album 4 stars but after some second thoughts I have decided that I will rate it 3 big stars."

          "text": "Emerson Lake & Palmer's eponymous debut hit the world in 1970 and started what would become a fruitful, yet at times trying relationship among these three talented musicians. Labeled as a supergroup at the time, and although unfortunate that they never got the chance to explore the incorporation of Jimi Hendrix into the group due to his unfortunate death, that supergroup label stuck with them ever since, even during their dismal return in the 1990s. It was well deserved nonetheless.Although the talent was there, much of the material off their debut was mostly solo-related. The only song where all three received credits was on the opening track The Barbarian. Lake was responsible for both ballads, Take a Pebble and Lucky Man. The latter track was originally recorded to fill leftover space on the record at the request of the record company. It was actually penned by Lake as a teenager, not well received by either Emerson or Palmer, and featured a one-take, improvised Moog solo at the end by Emerson. It became one of the band's biggest hits and a concert favorite.Carl Palmer is showcased on Tank where he shows off his virtuoso drumming style. The remaining tracks are Emerson's contributions. Incorporation of classical influences is easily noticeable with references to Bart\ufffdk, Jan\ufffd\u010dek, and Bach. In fact, many of these inspired pieces were note-for-note extractions placed inside a rock music setting, something Emerson is most noteworthy for. Original or not, it made for some interesting listening showcasing some beautifully played symphonic prog rock with many complex time signatures.My biggest issue with ELP is that each of their albums seems to have a couple of what seem to be unnecessary tracks just thrown in like they were there to fill up the space, maybe even precursors to what we all know as bonus tracks these days. For me, they tend to be the ballads and acoustic numbers written by Lake. When you have someone pounding away on the keyboards like a madman, although sloppy at times, and follow it up with a sleepy lullaby, the unevenness is glaring. Sometimes that can be put to good effect, but not here nor in any other ELP album that features this flaw. Furthermore, just from hearing these differences in style between Lake and Emerson on their very first album clearly shows the personality conflicts that would erupt between them for many years to come.An excellent debut with a perfect marriage of classical and complex rock, but with some flaws like the Lake filler and a question of being slightly unoriginal. Clearly very pretentious, but we all like that about ELP, don't we? Definitely a worthwhile purchase and easily worth four stars."

          "text": "It's both a surprise and an impressive statement that this first album by the symphonic supergroup is their best. The complicated relations of the three members and their individual talents actually work alongside each other at one-hundred percent here, creating a focus and determination one would have wanted for all the successive albums, but sadly is found only here.There has always been a deep schism in ELP's music, between top-class symphonic numbers and the more accessible songs, appealing to a wider audience. Heading off in your own direction, with the choice of combining these two styles, is by many considered the biggest flaw of the group. I'm often, but definitely not always, agreeing with it since it makes many of the albums feel like bags of wild ideas, without relation to each other and far from being in touch with the audience. It's an egocentric, introvert yet flamboyant style of music you often love OR hate. Stuck in a middle-ground between these camps, I find ELP's career to be an interesting mix of highs and lows. The self-titled debut is a definite high. It's definitely focused on sheer, brutal musicianship, leaving vocals and lyrics a little behind. If you find this hard to bear, be warned.With a menacing distorted guitar, The Barbarian opens the album in classic ELP style. Aggressive, loud and forceful, with technical and jagged keys from mr. Emerson and drum power from Palmer, you know you're in for a proper tour-de-force. Interestingly, the song develops into a nervous, paranoid theme with a compulsion that reminds me of Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso's Darwin!, only to return to more violent ground and the abrupt ending.Showcasing ELP's most prominent feature - the polarity - Take A Pebble is next. It's stunningly beautiful, sometimes reminiscent of the mellower King Crimson tunes, but with a lot more emphasis on piano. Soft-singing, Greg Lake delivers the first vocal line of this great tune. It's not sad, but reflective in nature. Mystical and enthralling, it's carried away on Emerson's delicate piano. The odd, cheerful middle-part with guitar feels very Yes-like for a while, but it's deceptive. In a matter of seconds, the piano is back, very classical-sounding this time. A real pleasure for tired ears.Lucky Man closes this phenomenal album, being the last jigsaw in the ELP puzzle. Simple in structure, light-hearted in ideas and concept and perhaps frustratingly accessible to some, it's a quality rock song nevertheless. Acoustic guitar as a textural backdrop, with a relaxed electric solo, standard drumming and Emerson surprisingly out of the picture. He delivers a Moog solo in the end, but it's actually not that mind-boggling. A fair, but not brilliant ending.Aggression is what prevails though, and most of the remaining songs wander off in that direction. The hard-rocking Knife Edge, a bit like something by Atomic Rooster, the chaotic and brilliant Three Fates, which I didn't like at all from the beginning, but which has evolved into an amazing display of Emerson's, but also Carl Palmer's disciplined frenzies as instrumentalists.It is absolutely an odd collection of songs. But they all work together, sharing one important thing: impressive quality. And sometimes that's all you need. There are some jazzy parts thrown around, there is a lot of arty pretension, stunning displays of skill, drama and fire. Borderline masterpiece.4 stars.//LinusW"

          "text": "Of their first four classic albums, this self titled debut is far and away my favourite. It's almost like it was tailor-made for me. Perfect fit. It's difficult to estimate how influencial this album became, but make no mistake it became a template for many bands who followed. I could heap praise upon each one of these three guys for their individual talents and no one would argue, but I think Palmer is the one who surprised me the most on this debut with his drum skills. I mean he's only 19 years old here but playing like a passionate, seasoned veteran.\"The Barbarian\" is raw and dirty to open. Check out Lake's filthy fuzz bass ! Meanwhile Emerson is ripping it up on his Hammond organ. Palmer meanwhile is simply incredible on the kit. Things change 1 1/2 minutes in as piano and drums take over. A gong sound signals a return of that fuzz bass and those nasty organ runs. Palmer is so good just firing off round after round. A knock out punch and they're just getting started. \"Take A Pebble\" is pastoral track with Lake's pleasant vocals as Emerson tinkles on the piano. The tempo picks up after 2 1/2 minutes with piano leading the way. A calm before 4 minutes with Lake on acoustic guitar. The tempo picks back up 5 1/2 minutes in with clapping. Back to a calm and acoustic guitar. Piano takes over 6 1/2 minutes in. Drums start to get more prominant after 9 minutes and bass joins in too. Vocals are back before 11 1/2 minutes to the end of the song.\"Knife-Edge\" features sinister sounding organ, and vocals that are darker. An uptempo organ/drum melody follows. These themes are repeated. Check out the organ and drums 3 1/2 minutes in. It becomes powerful 4 minutes in with vocals and killer organ runs. \"The Three fates\" opens with pipe organ. It's so powerful ! Piano 2 minutes in. Yes Emerson can play ! The organ is back 4 1/2 minutes in. Piano and drums follow. Great sound before 6 minutes. An explosion ends it. Appropriate. \"Tank\" opens with drums and a clavinet solo from Emerson. This all sounds pretty incredible. A collage of intricate sounds fills the air. Check Palmer out 2 minutes in until after 4 minutes when the other two finally join in. Love the synths 5 minutes in to the end of the song. \"Lucky Man\" was written by Lake when he was around 12 years old when he was learning to play guitar. He dreamed of what it would be like to be rich. To be a lucky man. I first heard this song when I was in my teens in the mid seventies and have never grown tired of it. It's a mellow song that tells a story. Acoustic guitar, vocals and drums to open. Awesome sound before 2 minutes. Palmer is so intricate, very Bruford-like here. Of course it ends with that famous moog synthesizer solo. Emerson didn't own one at this point, but there was one in the studio belonging to MANFRED MANN's Mike Vickers. He borrowed it and the rest is history."

Several of the album's tracks went on to become staples of the band's live sets and have appeared on several live albums and compilation.The album opens with the menacing The Barbarian (which, when I played it aloud today, frightened my cat so much it hid under the bed!). This is an adaptation of a piece by composer B\ufffdla Bart\ufffdk. This sort of adaptation of classical music was something that was to become a trademark of the band, and music composed by Leo? Jan\ufffd\u010dek and Johann Sebastian Bach is used on the track Knife-Edge.The Three Fates is an original three part composition by Keith Emerson in a classical vein while Take A Pebble and Lucky Man are written by Greg Lake in a more folky in nature and Tank shows Carl Palmer's jazzy influence. This mixture of Classical, Folk, and Jazz within a Rock context is the life blood of the band and essential to their greatness.The band had yet to mature fully, but they were already very good here. A very good start of a brilliant band. Highly recommended!"

          "text": "The trio of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake, and Carl Palmer, who created a few of the greatest progressive rock masterpieces imaginable, begin their adventure together weakly and rather disjointedly. It is hard for me to imagine the celebration of this album next to the reactions of horror that typically accompany Works Volume 1, particularly since what they seem to be here are three outstanding musicians who are completely apprehensive about working together. This album is a hodgepodge of classical and jazz piano music, singer-songwriter ballads, crunchy organ, and daring instrumentals.\"The Barbarian\" With a distorted introduction and some grating organ, along with wild snare-slapping and dynamic bass playing, the first one-and-a-half minutes of this piece is an excellent idea of what the band will sound like on forthcoming releases. What follows that, however, is a sudden piano interlude. It takes getting used to in the overall context of the piece, but it demonstrates Emerson's ability well. After this, there is more in the vein of what came before. It is one of the band's best instrumental tracks, and certainly the best instrumental on this album.\"Take a Pebble\" The opening to this one features alternating harmonious and discordant chords that makes one think of an autoharp played with only the benefit of a strumming hand. Overall, this is less like progressive rock and more like directionless meandering. The folk section that comes in later is apropos of nothing. Six-and-a-half minutes in, there is beautiful piano playing, some of Emerson's best, but again, it just seems capricious in context. Later, the band enters to make what sounded like classical piano jazzy. Lake's vocals bookend this unnecessarily long track, but just as the keyboard work up until this point has finely exhibited Emerson's ability, his singing displays what he will sound like during his finer moments with the group.\"Knife Edge\" The second of three vocal tracks, this song takes what was great about the first track and what was great about the second track, namely Emerson's organ and Lake's vocals, respectively, and blends them to produce a highly enjoyable listen. The song repeats themes without becoming repetitive, paving the way for further organ work. After the middle section (an ELP highlight in and of itself), Lake returns with more energized vocals. It's unfortunate the song fizzles out in the manner it does.\"The Three Fates (Clotho/Lachesis/Atropos)\" This is the point in the album where ELP begin to seem less like a ensemble, and more like a threesome of solo artists sharing studio time. Emerson has already shown how amazing he is at what he does, so why the need for an extended three-part instrumental exclusively featuring church organ, piano, and then more piano with some unwarranted drumming? While it's certainly understandable that ELP (and many artists in the early seventies) were not consciously trying to write progressive rock (the way many modern symphonic acts seem to be doing), Emerson's solo act is no more progressive rock than any classical or jazz pianist playing alone is.\"Tank\" Finally Palmer gets a real opportunity to show his stuff, with a drum solo both to open the song and two minutes in. The dual clavinets and piano are all over the place for the most part during the time before this, which is sad really, because the bass line is truly one of Lake's best. It is not until Palmer's solo is finished that Emerson finally breaks out the Moog, using it both as a solo instrument and to beef up the rhythm section.\"Lucky Man\" Almost an afterthought, it was this song that was largely responsible for taking ELP to the airwaves. Its chords are played on a twelve-string guitar and Lake sensitively sings the words. The improvised synthesizer solo at the end sounds out of place and can be annoying in parts. Overall, it's a good song, but nothing at all compared to what would come."

          "text": "We all know the story of these three guys so I won't take time explaining it. In my opinion BSS is the ultimate ELP masterpiece ( and prog rock masterpiece as well) , but this album is a high point in their career.When I think of ELP I tend to focus on the huge epics like KE9 , Tarkus or , The endless enigma but when I started paying attention to The Barbarian I realized what a great tune it was. Just 4 and a half minutes long but including every single aspect of ELP's career . OK no vocals this time , but you get: Classical influenced keyboards , versatile drumming and a fuzz bass that sounds like a roaring beast! I picture the faces of the ones who first heard this piece in 1970 , it must have been overwelming. There can't be a better way of introducing themselves in a record.The second piece settles a huge contrast to the previous one , it's a very relaxing one with an acustic interlude by Greg Lake , also I must add that his vocals in this song are among the best he ever did. This type of songs is what made me become an ELP addict , sometimes this song reminds me of Keith Jarrett and makes me wonder why Emerson did not release a solo album in the vein of the Koln Concert , I would have bought it for sure.Kinfe edge is a hard rock piece , much similar to the heaviest moments of the Nice and Atomic Rooster. It may sound weird on a prog rock site but the way this tune develops reminds me of Nirvana , Lake sings quiet the verse and then the song reaches a peak in intensity. If anyone has a doubt about ELP rocking or not just heard this tune.The second side of this album is their more exprimental one , in which hints of ELP's future records will be found. The three fates is a haunting instrumental featuring a church organ first , then a percussion movement and lastly several layers of keyboards by Emerson. i picture this song to be hugely influential to japanese symph groups like Ars Nova or Gerard , again if you have any doubt as regarding this fact just check The Goddess of Darkness by Ars Nova , there is Three Fates all over it.ELP was always about instrumental abilities. Tank features a Carl Palmer drum solo which is accompanied by Emerson's Moog. I really like the outro to this song because of Palmer's simple yet powerful drumming. As a negative aspect I have to say the production is not the best. Last tune of the album is hit single Lucky Man , which is a ballad that features very moving vocals by Lake , with the exeption of Emo's famous Moog solo at the end of it ; this song has no progressive elements around and it feels quite out of place in the album. However what would an ELP show without Lucky Man?Outstanding debut , 4.5 stars"

          "text": "Like this album needs another review, but heck with it! Emerson, Lake, and Palmer had already outdone themselves on their self-titled debut! The keyboard playing in each track is phenomenal! No wonder Keith Emerson is called the Jimi Hendrix of the Hammond organ, he's amazing! This really shows on the tracks The Barbarian and The Three Fates. On The Three Fates the organ is immediately noticeable and it only gets better after that as they go into the piano trio which is amazing! Lucky Man the hit single is an excellent track although it definitely could've done without the synth solo in the end which just doesn't seem to fit it. All the other tracks are very good and there is nothing just thrown in here which seemed to be the case of their later albums. It's a masterpiece ELP!EDIT:Gosh this album grows stale after awhile even with it's impressive passages. Guess it's not a masterpiece, but just an excellent piece."

          "text": "This self-titled debut of ELP's possibly represents the band at their most focused and most restrained...so is it any good?My answer would be just listen to the first thing you hear, that fuzzed-out bass thing at the beginning of ''The Barbarian''. That instrumental track is an all-out assault on the ears with the pounding drums, heavy bass and piercing organ. If that's not enough, they managed to reprise the assault on ''Knife Edge'' (add in some vocals) and ''Tank'' (with an astounding clavinet part). This heavy bass-keys sound is what I enjoy most from ELP, the band and the album.However, it isn't an ELP without even a slight degree of pretentiousness. ''The Three Fates'' is just that to the max, a chance for Keith to show how impressive he is on church organ and piano all the while not much impressing me either. Carl Palmer is also guilty by squeezing in a drum solo in the middle of ''Tank'', although that solo doesn't get on my nerves. My problem is that this is the first album to feature the ''obligatory Greg Lake sappy ballad'', one that will be copied several times throughout ELP's career to get radio play. Here, the ballad is ''Lucky Man'', and it contains some of the worst lyrics in the ELP canon. The catchy chorus saves the song though.All three kind of get out of hand on ''Take a Pebble''. While the acoustic guitar is put to great use in the form of a country-hoedown-esque solo (I rarely have complements for ANYTHING country) and Keith lays down some great piano solos (including the very beginning of which he plucks the strings inside the piano), ultimately, it's length gives me fits as many solos go on for longer than I desire.All fussing aside, check this out if you think excursions like ''Tarkus'' and ''Karn Evil 9'' are too much for you. Probably my personal favourite of the ELP albums I've heard so far."

Keith Emerson had used classical pieces as the basis for his rock songs while inThe Nice, but never with a band with this amount of talent. Carl Palmer's drumming and Greg Lake's bass, guitar and singing voice far surpassed their counterparts in Emerson's old band.Right from the start ofThe Barbarian, with a roar from Lake's guitar, and Emerson's might Hammond organ, the listener knew he was in for a new experience.Bartokhad never sounded so cool. Every song here, even the soft ballads, are classics of prog.Take A Pebblemay be ELP's most beautiful song, with Emerson's piano deftly describing the ripples created in the ocean from a tossed pebble.Knife Edgegives us a very heavy piece, based onLeos Janacek'sSinfonietta. This song would become a live favorite for the band, with Emerson throwing knives into his tortured Hammond.The Three Fatesis first an organ-heavy piece, that then turns to piano amazingness.Tankis a fusion piece, one of the few Palmer had a hand in writing. AndLucky Man, well, everyone knows that song. It still, to this day, gets plenty of radio airplay.While this does not have ELP's best songs, it is certainly their most consistent album."

Bands worldwide must have been envious of the debut that stamped authority on prog and a unique blend of symphony and rock. Every track screams to be noticed and are all bonafide classics in their own right.The Barbarian is a fabulous complex instrumental featuring chaotic drumming and a frenetic Hammond from Emerson. What a way to introduce the band! Take A Pebble is close to my favourite prog song with beautiful lilting vocals and an amazing melody line that is unforgettable. The lyrics are simply mesmirising. I love the piano interlude and acoustic instrumental. An absolutely brilliant piece of virtuoso music from end to end. You will find it on all good ELP compilations.Knife-Edge is a trademark ELP track and features Hammond stabs and wall to wall bass and drums. A very frenetic time signature and potent vocals. The 4 chord staccato stabs are powerful and aggressive.The Three Fates is the lengthy majestic Emerson showpiece that grows on you on each listen. It is perhaps the only track not found on compilations as a general rule.Tank showcases Palmers enimatble style, a drum time signature that made all other drumers sit up and take notice.Lucky Man became ultra popular and blitzed the charts showing the softer balladic style of the band and Lake's quiet approach to music. And there you have it. A master class performance. Not the best they will do but as far as a debut goes, it would be hard to find better."

Playing just in power trio format, they 're maiking impression of full orchestra added, Album songs are very different in melodies,styles and arrangements, so you wouldn't be boring during listening. Main album sound is Emerson keyboards,for sure, but pleasantly total sound is acoustic enough ( I hate all this over- produced sympho-rock bands filling all the space not with music, but with pseudo-classic keyboard's sound).The Barbarian is a gem, classic ELP song for years. Longest composition \" Take The Pebble\" contains Greg vocal ( I have nothing against it, but some people don't like his voice). Long construction contains classic piano sound mixed with jazzy drums and bass line, and I like it!Knife Edge and The Three Fates ... demonstrate nice neo-classic piano technicue both. Again, in combination with jazzy drumming and some synth effects it give really nice result.Tank is synth-based instrumental with characteristic sound of early seventies and long drums solos.All album is still not as bombastic as later ELP works ( for good). Palmer's drumming is more jazzy there,and it really gives some air to total sound. \"Lucky Man\" is traditional ballad ( many critics hate it because of simplicity and lyrics, but I prefer this naive song against complex songs about dragons and elves so popular between pseudo sympho-proggers).I am sure, that it is very strong debut and one of the best ELP album. Absolutely recommended to everyone interested in sympho-prog roots and one of the best bands for years."

          "text": "ELP is probably one of the most debated of all classic prog bands, praised to heaven by some, slated by others. I find myself in both camps really, often even simultaneously, one moment marvelling at their unique sound and musicianship, the next shaking my head in desperation at the pointless and emotionless drivel they churned out. Also their debut doesn't escape this ambiguity and contains both pearls of prog and annoying filler.The first track is essential, in so far that I would include it on a 'mixed tape' sampler of prog music - supposing someone would actually ask for that.The Barbarianis rock music full of classical influences, it's big, overstated, pompous, grandiose, swirling, epic, virtuosic, it's prog! And it only needs 4.30 minutes to make its point.Take A Pebbleshows another side of ELP, more lyrical, melodious and romantic. It's the Lake side of ELP, more classic rock ballad oriented, tasteful and more subtle then Emerson's extravagance. It's the other aspect of ELP's sound that makes them an interesting listen.Take A Pebbleis a beautiful piece of music; even if the middle part is a bit long-winded, (especially the piano section).Knife Edgeis another classic ELP track where all 3 forces in the band come together very successfully, the heavy organs from Emerson, the pumping bass and commanding vocals from Lake and Palmer's superb drumming.Side B of the original album has a whole lot less to offer, at least to me, when I want to hear church organ I'll put on Bach and when it comes to piano, there's a library full of more meaningful pieces from classic composers and jazz pianists.The Three Fatesis not bad by any means but it's a bridge too far for me. The last two minutes with the entire band make more sense.Tankis the desperation moment. There are worse examples but still this is where purposeless virtuosity for its own sake takes over, the drum solo is downright tedious. However, the last 2 minutes save this one again and demonstrate what this band could achieve when they set their minds to it. A great staccato rhythm sets the pace for one of the first moog solos on a rock album, and it's a great one, both playful, smart and dramatic.Lucky Manis ELP's campfire moment, unexpectedly ending with anther big moog party.Making consistent albums wasn't ELP's specialty and the debut suffers from their lack of consistency. Overall, I count a good 20 minutes of really great music here. The remainder is a bit average but nothing that's really poor.EDIT: I though I likedTarkusmore but upon reviewing that one, I realised this debut is my preferred ELP release after all."

          "text": "Masterpiece?When people talk about the classic progressive rock groups, ELP is always mentioned. While I won't dispute their significance in the progressive rock world, they have never excited me as much as other classic prog bands such as Yes, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, and Genesis.This was the third ELP album I had purchased afterTrilogyand thenBrain Salad Surgery. I find both of those albums moderately enjoyable (probably 3 star albums), but I did find them overrated. When I bought their debut album I was really expecting something great, but I was very disappointed. Whereas the two above mentioned albums have many redeemable qualities behind the excessive noodling, this album never really did much for me. I don't think I'll ever understand what is so great about ELP, and why I'm unable to discover it. This album certainly didn't do me any favors from that aspect, and makes me question their music even more.For those of you who have never heard ELP, this is progressive rock (though I wouldn't nessacerily label it \"symphonic\" prog) with many classical influences. There are some hard rock leanings mostly because of the heavy dependence on Hammond organ. The music has a lot of weak transitions, and is focused mostly on Keith Emerson's virtuosic keyboard abilities. The skill and talent is present on all of these songs, but the memorable melodies and consistency is only present for brief visits.THE MUSIC:\"The Barbarian\"- The first starts with a distorted guitar riff, that soon turns into heavy and dark organ chords. I remember the first time I heard this I was immediately in love. Keith Emerson's talent on the organ shines right here, and Carl Palmer does an excellent job as well. Almost out of nowhere, it turns into a classically-influenced piano section. I think the song would have faired much better without it, to be honest. The transition into this section is weak, and the section itself is nothing too memorable, and seems directionless. Luckily the original section soon returns, and Keith Emerson amazes me again. The organ soloing is truly excellent. Overall, this is a mixed bag, though. It definitely has its moments, but it is lacking in consistency.\"Take A Pebble\"- The first song opens up with a beautiful piano melody. The opening is really good and when Greg Lake's vocals enter it's pure magnificence. Soon a classical-sounding piano section enters. It sounds really good, even if it doesn't really fit. Soon a folky guitar section enters. This entire section (and trust me it's pretty long) doesn't fit at all, and seems almost pointless to me. It gets absolutely nowhere, even if the guitar playing is solid. When the classical piano enters again, too much of it seems like noodling for my tastes, but the musicianship is excellent. It builds well into the ending. Again, this is a very uneven song, and only about half of it is really worthwhile. This is much longer than it needs to be.\"Knife-Edge\"- After the fairly boring and overly long previous track, this immediately brought my attention back. After the bombastic organ opening, it goes into a bluesy-section with just bass, drums, and Greg Lake's vocals. Much of the song builds off of these two sections, and it does it excellently. This has some great soloing from Keith Emerson. This is my favorite song from the album, and I wish more of the album would be like this.\"The Three Fates\"- We all know the saying that good things never last. Well this is a perfect representation of that. After the magnificent previous track, this just strikes me as boring, pretentious, and unnecessary. The opening church organ solo is decent enough, but it does nothing for me. It goes into a piano section that is just pure noodling. Nothing more, nothing less. The church organ shortly returns and just plays the same chords over and over again. A weak transition brings us into a complex piano section with drumming. This whole song is completely pointless in my opinion, and it just seems like Keith Emerson showing off. Needless to say, it doesn't impress me.\"Tank\"- This is Carl Palmer's solo spot, and he shows his chops clearly. This is a weak composition, though. The musicianship is spot-on as always, but the songwriting does nothing for me. That's usually my main problem with ELP. Their talent is undeniable, but the music is often questionable. This is another fairly useless track.\"Lucky Man\"- This is often the most scolded track on the album, but I must say that it is one of my favorites from the album. Unlike most of the other songs, this actually has memorable melodies and it is consistent from beginning to end. I love the synth solo near the end especially. This is a great closing track, though I'm sure many will be quick to deny it.Conclusion:Emerson, Lake & Palmeris a pretty overrated album in my opinion. The musicianship is excellent, but the music often is directionless and leaves me cold. ELP's music just never interests me as much as Yes, Jethro Tull, or Genesis, and this album is no exception. I enjoy some of their later albums, but their debut is flawed in various ways. I don't consider myself an ELP fan much at all, but this is one of my least favorites from this era. If you're interested in ELP, I recommend going to their next couple albums, as I find them moderately enjoyable. This album is lacking terms in consistency and memorable moments. I know many will disagree, but I can't give this more than a 2 star rating. I don't think I'll ever understand what's so great about this album.2 stars."

          "text": "The first and the bestEmerson, Lake and Palmer got together from their three previous bands - Emerson's The Nice, Lake's King Crimson and Palmer's Atomic Rooster. They released their debut album - homonymous Emerson Lake and Palmer, to a dreat commercial success in 1970. In my opinion, this one will eventually remain their best album. The musicianship is perfect. These musicians are magicians, but regretfully their composer's skills are not of the same high quality as their musicianship. Despite that, all songs are memorable and interesting. The album is highly influenced by classical music, most notably in Take a Pebble and The Three Fates. Piano solos by brilliant Keith Emerson are exceptional moments all around the album. The voice of Greg Lake is of high quality, especially in vocal-oriented song - Knife-Edge and famous ballad Lucky Man. The opening track - The Barbarian contains darker themes as well as the third part of The Three Fates. Tank is captivating mixture between different ideas, including eastern influence and contains drum solo by Carl Palmer. It's quite experimental album, highly recommended for classical fans and quite recommended for prog fans with dynamic taste. 4 stars!"

          "text": "By 1970, when Emerson, Lake and Palmer released their eponymous debut, the infant progressive rock movement was really beginning to grow, and flex its muscles. King Crimson had established an influential prog blueprint the year before with IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING, and future top-tier progressive acts Yes and Genesis were each toddling to their wee prog feet with sophomore efforts TIME AND A WORD and TRESPASS, respectively.EMERSON, LAKE AND PALMER saw prog's most potent trio emerge fully-fleshed upon the developing scene. It's an impressive first effort, with all of the classic ELP elements in place. The band whose names would become synonymous with the genre -- for a few bright years in a positive fashion, but, during prog's 76 to 77 fall from grace, more often in a scornful manner -- had a firm musical identity, and knew their business right off the mark. Singer Greg Lake had already honed his grand, inspiring vocal style during his two-album stint with Crimson, keyboardist extraordinaire Keith Emerson had been wowing audiences with his prowess for some time with The Nice, and Carl Palmer now confirmed his burgeoning reputation as a drummer's drummer, having been the tour drummer for The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and a founding member (and studio drummer) for Atomic Rooster. The three ELP men were no smooth-cheeked neophytes, but seasoned musicians and recording artists.That deep pool of experience is apparent on EMERSON, LAKE AND PALMER's opening track, the instrumental \"The Barbarian,\" which is four and a half minutes of rampaging, head-hewing, pure prog power and majesty. Emerson in particular shines here, with some church-style organ and some lightning-fast work on the piano. The second piece, the magnificent twelve-and-a-half minute, multi-part \"Take a Pebble\" finds Lake delivering some typically stirring vocals, while Emerson and Palmer get to stretch out and show off their flashy, jazzy chops in perfect complement to one another. Next up is \"Knife Edge,\" another heavy number which encapsulates all of the quintessential ELP elements within its five minutes. Palmer's stellar performance on the skins and cymbals, and Emerson's mastery of the Hammond are again the highlights. \"The Three Fates\" is an instrumental, which takes the listener to some grandiose cathedral of prog, via Emerson's imposing pipe organ opening. Piano and drums also get a real workout here, and the high-ceilinged sound evokes the mythological motif of the title, before a literally explosive close. This, boys and girls, is the sound rock makes when it's progressing! \"Tank\" is another instrumental, and this initially nimble number at first belies its name. Formidable finesse is seen in Palmer's \"obligatory for the early 70s\" drum solo, before the slower main theme asserts itself for the closing half. Now one can readily envision the armoured killing machine of the title, lumbering along in smug, impenetrable might. Finally, the album ends with 70s FM favourite \"Lucky Man.\" (Only the cloying \"C'est la Vie,\" from the overblown WORKS, would ever garner ELP as much air time.) \"Lucky Man\" is a nice enough song, though its lyrics are somewhat school-boyish and didactic in their heavy-handed message that wealth does not bring true happiness, or even (gasp!) forestall death. Still, Lake's acoustic guitar is pretty, and dig that spacey synthesizer at the close -- far out! (Hey, it was a new sound way back then, and it impressed my shell-pink ears to no end -- even if it sounds a mite dated and corny as I listen today. Alas, fleeting innocence, I hardly knew ye! How dare I be so jaded?)Thus, EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER was a strong debut, which played no small role in solidifying the progressive rock template. Jazzy affectations, classical pretensions, \"deep\" lyrics, pompous musical bombast and complexity, along with sheer \"look what I can do\" ace musicianship, had constructed a gilded home. A growing, worshipful audience, eager for more such heady fare, soon came calling. These days, as prog's favourite whipping boys, ELP have fallen far from the Olympian peak of slavering adulation they once occupied. Still, here one can find out how they attained such rarified heights in the first place. EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER is must for all fans, and for any comprehensive collection of early progressive rock."

          "text": "Boy, did THIS album ever grow on me. When I first got it, I basically liked it, but probably would have given it only a high ***. Then it grew on me some more, and comfortably settled into a **** range. Then when I thought it would go no further, I eventually found something that basically shocked me - not only had this album managed to sneak its way into my top 100 overall (for a while, anyway), it had managed to be an important reason in my upgraded opinion of ELP as a great band. Brain Salad Surgery may be the focus of ELP's fame (for better or for worse), but THIS is the album that makes them deserving of that fame.Indeed, the first half of this album is just about PERFECT, one of the best sides of any prog album I own. \"The Barbarian\" is an astounding opener, an update of an old Bartok piece that takes on a life of its own here. If you're a cynic who says that Emerson's playing is merely self-indulgent tripe that cannot be easily enjoyed by a casual listener, you really need to give this track a listen or three. It took me a while to get into the rest of the album (to varying degrees, anyway), but this track sucked me in right away. The opening distorted bassline/guitarline is much moodier and \"tougher\" than one would stereotypically expect out of ELP, and once Emerson jumps in with his keyboards and begins driving forward theme after theme with his whole array of piano and organ tricks, any expectation of archetypical British \"wussiness\" on the album should fly right out the window. All three are at their very best throughout this track, managing to both demonstrate their huge talent AND make sure that the listener actually cares about what they can do with that talent, with the final result an unabashed prog classic.The next track is no slouch either, and quite possibly even better. \"Take a Pebble\" is based around an absolutely gorgeous ballad courtesy of Greg, and what truly makes the song magnificent is the soaring and powerful vocal effort that Lake graces it with. Now, I appreciate Jon Anderson's vocal approach as much as anybody, but I will admit that prog tunes benefit when the vocalist is able to (almost) convince the listener that the bombastic and meaningless ravings are actually relevant and, well, emotionally move the listener. And Lake does just that; not that the lyrics are all bad (\"the sadness on your shoulders like a wornout overcoat, in pockets greased and tattered hang the rags of your hopes,\" there's a good line), but they really need that extra oomph in order to make them work. In any case, there's also a really nice middle instrumental section. Parts are in typically bombastic classical motifs, but they really sound interesting (once again, Emerson is at his beautiful best, this time on piano), especially after we get to be enchanted with, of all things, a nice Mississippi-style acoustic ditty (which once again provides a perfect example of ELP's ability to deflate itself at needed times, at least in the early days of the band). As you might imagine, when they performed it in concert, they would stick tons of music between the bookends of the piece, often sticking several of their other tunes in the middle, but this 'miniature' seven or eight minute middle section is wonderful in and of itself.Next up is \"Knife Edge,\" which I once disliked for whatever reason, but I was a F-O-O-L. An adapation of a classical piece (the name and author of which escapes me at the moment), this track is a nearly perfect summary of all of ELP's talents, with almost none of the flaws (except possibly \"self-indulgence,\" but that's just something you have to accept with ELP, and besides, nothing about this track is particularly self-indulgent). The basslines RULE, Lake's vocal delivery is aggressive and forceful in a manner that he didn't use nearly enough in the rest of the band's career (yup, I actually prefer aggressive Lake to bombastic Lake, even though the latter is just great), Emerson's playing is a perfect mix of jarring organ dissonance and blazing organ solos (ALL of which are interesting), and of course Palmer is Palmer. I tell you, when Lake blasts out his, \"CAN YOU STILL KEEP YOUR BALANCE?!!\" vocal near the end, it's absolute meaningless (but not imageless, make the distinction people) bombastic prog bliss for me, and when taken all together, it's little wonder that this is the track (along with \"The Barbarian,\" heh) that I use to try to introduce people to ELP (and with a decent level of success, considering that it's ELP, heh).Unfortunately, the majority of the second half of the album doesn't come close to matching the sheer brilliance of the first, and for many people this is what causes the rating of this to come crashing down like a ton of bricks. The first two tracks of this side, you see, comprise a lengthy (about 15 minutes) instrumental suite, consisting of a multi-part classically- influenced keyboard piece (\"The Three Fates\") and a drum solo (\"Tank\"). Upon first (and possibly second, and third) listen, these will come across as a completely self-indulgent mess, and it's possible you may want to dismiss them outright (I know I basically did). On the other hand, though, by making the three sections of \"The Three Fates\" distinctive from each other in both sound and mood, not to mention actually somewhat memorable (even for somebody who doesn't spend all day listening to this sort of thing), Emerson found a way to make me enjoy the piece much more than theory says I should, and as such I'm not at all offended by its inclusion on this album. As for \"Tank,\" well, it's a drum solo, and I don't much like drum solos, so it does somewhat offend me. That said, I'm amused that the band employs one significant variation on virtually every other drum solo ever recorded, namely that the main riff of the piece is played by keyboards and not by guitar, and as far as the actual solo goes, I think that Palmer is better suited for \"show-off\" soloing than most others I've heard (just because of his incredible technical ability), so I don't hate it as much as I do other solos.Fortunately for all, the album ends not on an ambivalent note (regarding my attitude towards it), but rather on an extremely strong one, courtesy of the radio hit \"Lucky Man.\" The song does a wonderful job of reminding the listener that the foundation of the band's greatness lay not with all their instrumental pyrotechnics, but with their ability to create solid \"normal\" songs, with their playing abilities serving as an augmentation and not as a replacement for true inspiration and creativity. The ultimately tragic lyrics work well with the sea chanty-style melody, and while some might gripe that the ending synth solo (filled with all sorts of cool pitch-bending) is tacked on and completely inappropriate (not me, though), there can be no question that it leaves a major impression (for better or worse, depending) on the listener come album's end, and I'm all for leaving strong impressions. Besides, it functions well on a symbolic level as well, a sort of trumpet's call proclaiming the band's entrance into the pantheon of significant artists (at least for a couple of years).In short, this is a solid 10, and without a doubt my very very favorite ELP album. It's the one that entertains me the most, and furthermore it's the one that interests me the most - after all, even if it doesn't define an entire genre likeIn the Court of the Crimson Kingdoes, it does represent an intriguing projection of modern-classical values onto conventional rock ideas, and that's definitely worth something in my book."

          "text": "Most fans/listeners/people would agree that ELP's debut is probably one of their better releases, perhaps on a par with 'Trilogy', but not up there with 'Brain Salad Surgery'. And so I was surprised to see that on this site, it is the highest ranked album by the trio with a good forty places above their alleged magnum opus.It almost definately has something to do with the cloud of pretentiousness that has been thrust upon the band, because this is the only release where such a quality isn't present. And while some people have obviously underated the music on later albums due to the members' egos, that's not something I believe is fair. Sure, egocentricism is a social turn-off, but in order to even have any degree of success in the music industry you must showcase yourself. People might as well make music in private if others are going to criticise their attitude.Anyway, 'Emerson, Lake and Palmer' is a fine album regardless of such arguments, but is it deserving of its place in the middle section of our top 100? I'm not so sure. It's fequently good, but also frequently individualistic. There are plenty of moments (by which I mean, too many on side 2) where only one or two of the band members are playing. And albums such as 'Ummagumma' and 'Fragile' prove that this only works if the music has a point to it, which on both albums, it doesn't. And I'm afraid to say that it doesn't here either. 'The Three Fates' is purely a pianist's virtuoso display; fine, but the bulk of 'Take a Pebble' already proved that Emerson was a fantastic musician, not to mention being a vehicle for Lake's acoustic skills. And with 'Lucky Man' being self-confessed filler, the only neccesary song on side 2 is 'Tank', an actual song with a brief drum solo that makes it's point and leaves again. Carl Palmer knows the difference between a studio and a stage.I have no complaints about the group tracks; later albums would show significant development but these arrangements are good evidence that ELP was a band worth forming. In fact, despite my harsh remarks, all six tracks here are decent. It's just that 'Take a Pebble' and 'Knife Edge' sum up this band's sound enough between them to make the latter songs not needed. If 'Works' was too diverse, then this is too samey.In conclusion, this debut is a classy and dynamic album, but it had something important to say:\"Emerson, Lake and Palmer are a great band, but they've already run out of ideas\"Thankfully the impending 'Tarkus' would disprove such a claim..."

          "text": "I've been very patient when it comes to reviewing ELP albums. The reason for that is the fact that the first four albums strike a nostalgic chord with me that will probably effect my judgment. But after thinking about it I've decided to give it a go. I just what you all to know that you should take my ELP-reviews with a grain of salt since they're written by a fan.ELP albums have never, in my opinion, really been group efforts. That was until I discovered Emerson, Lake & Palmer's debut album. Here, I can actually hear Greg Lake's contributions on every track while still getting my regular dosage of Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer. It's clear that the band has a bunch of clever ideas, but those ideas wouldn't all be implemented with the same greatness as on their later releases. In other words, this album gives us a great group effort but lacks the maturity.Only the album openerThe Barbarianis great enough to be comparable with the band's later work.Take A Pebbledefinitely comes close to greatness but falls due to the very loose middle section of the track. My recommendation is to start withTarkus,Pictures At An ExhibitionandTrilogyand later work your way to this release and maybe evenBrain Salad Surgery. Although, if you ask me, you can probably skip everything that came afterTrilogyall together since it's all just an ego trip between the band members.The band's debut album is a good example of what these three individuals might have achieved if only they continued to collaborate as a band. Instead they only fell further apart from each other with each consecutive release. This, in no way, implies that they still couldn't write great music, even though it was never again the band effort that can be observed here.***** star songs: The Barbarian (4:33)**** star songs: Take A Pebble (12:34) Knife-Edge (5:08 The Three Fates (7:45) Tank (6:52) Lucky Man (4:36)"

That keyboards could be that expressive, and that dominant was totally revelatory to me. I had never before heard \"rock\" classical music--though with a jazzy flavor to it. Though I had not yet heard Aaron Copeland or Bach's compositions for church organ, I felt as though I were being introduced to the masters of old--Keith EMERSON provided a kind of bridge to classical music (which I would dive into whole-heartedly in the 1980s). 1. \"The Barbarian\" (4:33) is such an introductory bridge for me. (9/10)2. \"Take a Pebble\" (12:34) has some of the most gorgeous vocal and bass melodies in all music. To think that Greg LAKE could even conceive of singing his beautiful lines over such odd musical background is still astounding to me. (10/10)3. \"Knife Edge\" (5:08) is powerful for both keyboards and Greg LAKE's vocal. (Not much of a fan of the drumming here.) (8/10)The three-part keyboard extravaganza, 4. \"The Three Fates\" (7:45) starts off so majestic and pompously with the awesome church organ, then goes into the amazing piano part--which, incidentally, feels as if it has three distinct personalities--before moving into the trio section. Awesome ride! (Pre-dating RENAISSANCE's comparable \"Trip to the Fair\" by a few years.) (10/10)5. \"Tank\" (6:52). The world of electronic keyboards was so new to me, and this album had a lot to do with introducing me to the possibilities of said instruments. BTW, this song puts on display Carl PALMER's best drumming on the album. (Finally!) (9/10)6 \"Lucky Man\" (4:36) is to this day probably my favorite all-time prog radio \"hit\" (rivalled only by FOCUS' \"Hocus Pocus\"). As much hate as it gets around here I find myself mystified: It is such a cool, gorgeous song with one of the greatest instrumental exits EVER! Prog's \"Man of La Mancha\"! (10/10)I did not like this album--or ELP--so much when I first heard it but each and every successive listen to this album has helped to win me over and caused the band (and album) to grow in my esteem. I now feel that this eponymous debut album is one of the most important, foundational albums of all of progressive rock music. Amazing, start to finish!"

The playing here is fluid and the songwriting is barely existent, although it stands that I really don't like ELP's music and this review is only for review's sake.\"The Barbarian\" is heavy rock inspired prog jam that is quite energetic and fun to listen to. \"Take a Pebble\" is the first track that I had ever heard of ELP and it serves as a terrific introduction to the band. It's a calm track that starts with Emerson strumming the strings inside of his piano, creating a very nice atmosphere that is instantly memorable and gripping. The vocals are also strong here. The song goes through various passages that seem to be loosely strung together, but manages to come off as playful rather than overly serious. \"Knife-edge\" is another rock inspired song with a very solid bass line and strong keyboards. This track comes across as a bit too goofy for me, and I personally never enjoyed it. Most of \"The Three Fates\" is a jazzy and modern classical inspired piano solo, but the other instruments later come in at the end and manage to make quite a bit of noise. This only stands out as being the only incessantly noisy track. \"Tank\" is a noisy and random track that most people seem to enjoy, but I also find this track to be forgettable and incessantly noisy. After all the noise, \"Lucky Man\" is a classic acoustic ballad that is very accessible. It still isn't a song that I enjoy, but it is beautiful and a great break from all the madness that came before it.I recommend this to people who already know they like ELP, which I am not. In fact, I know that I don't like ELP. However, this is one of their best albums, and I recommend this as an introduction to the band."

          "text": "Emerson Lake & Palmer - st (1970)To be honest with you, listening to this album was a relief for me. I'm not that good at liking common 'masterpieces' and this ELP debut was actually quite extraordinary, especially when you place it on a time-line of progressive rock.Keith Emerson (the Nice), Greg Lake (King Crimson) and Carl Palmer (Arthur Brown, Atomic Rooster) formed this first super-group of progressive rock. With their music they changed the way progressive rock was perceived. From now on progressive rock didn't need to be music with strange atmospheres and innovative ideas, but the extreme technicality would ad both ego and some playfulness to the mix. ELP didn't embark on the spacey atmospheric passages, but they would play fast, thick, right in your face instrumental passages without to much delays and reverb.The recording quality & sound of this album is stunning for 1970. All instruments sound warm, clear and have a good place in the musical land-scape. Later on dozens of Italian symphonic progressive rock groups would try to get this sound again, and frankly, none ever did except for Banco (debatable topic though). Most of the time ELP has a bass, drums and two keyboards or a piano. The arrangements are exciting and bombastic, with many organ and moog sounds (with amazing bass) that would make you forget a band ever needed a guitar player. Though this album has many moments of great intelligent en technical compositions, the other big element of his album is showing of musicianship. Luckily there's also some good song-writing and I must say I even like the ending ballad 'Lucky Man'. I still think Greg Lake is one of the best vocalists of prog, though I don't like many ELP recordings.Conclusion. This is the best ELP album for me, and it's good to know it still sounds fresh after more then forty years. Though this album features all weaknesses of the band, it is dominated by the quality of the compositions and the song-writing. After this only side one of Tarkus would be of this quality IMHO. Four stars for this one, but I can recommend it to every-one on this site."

Not uncritically - although the performances are undeniably good, they don't reach the stratosphere, but then again they don't reach the depths of later work either. I would say, in fact, that if you want *consistency*, this is the best ELP album of them all - later albums would be much more up-and-down in terms of quality.The album starts with some rocked-out classics in the form of The Barbarian, with a down and dirty performance that proves that this supergroup can get heavy if it wants to (though it's no Atomic Rooster). Other highlights include Take a Pebble, in which the group proves that it can bring jazz into its formula as well as classical music, and the closing Lucky Man which binds a Moog solo to a folk-rock number with surprising success.I guess part of the reason I can't quite extend my rating to five stars is that the album feels directionless. Musically, the group are very diverse, but the consequence of that is that the tracks don't seem to flow together very well and it's hard to say what the band's identity or sound at this point really is - or even if it does have an identity at all beyond being a vehicle for the three named talents to strut their stuff. They would succeed in forging a unique sound for themselves in the title track of Tarkus... but that album, and subsequent ones, would continue to have the problem that the three musical personalities in the group just never quite gelled, resulting in all of their work having a similar lack of focus to this one. That said, even if I find their later work patchy, still *this* album turns me on. (See what I did there?) Four stars."

          "text": "Reviewing albums from 1970 on a progressive rock site without mentioning Emerson Lake & Palmers debut would be beyond foolish, so here it is. Concerning 1970, I actually would consider this the most important prog album of the year. Plenty of the major forces in prog were developing their sound and even releasing some fantastic albums, but most of those bands' seminal releases would not occur until the following few years. However, ELP did not waste their time churning out one of their highest regarded works from the get-go, packaged in an album cover that comes across like The Moody Blues in an uncharacteristically morbid and bleak mood.\"The Barbarian\" starts off with a mean distorted bass before the keyboards kick in and it is soon realized that this is pure keyboard driven prog rock without things like loud guitars getting in the way. Still, this does have some power and 'oomph' to it, and the song does not feel incomplete despite lacking ripping guitar solos and vocals.\"Take A Pebble\" is an interesting track with its gorgeous verses and long break in the middle with a bit of a hoedown tossed in. Odd, but strangely atmospheric. \"Knife-Edge\" has a bit of that Atomic Rooster sound to it and actually feels like all of the performers' previous bands contributed equal levels of influence to the overall sound of the song.\"The Three Fates\" is Emerson's \"LOOK AT ME\" song, and for what it's worth, I pretty much dig the 2nd part featuring the solo piano quite a bit. \"Tank\" is Palmer's stab at glory, and it starts off cool, but drum solos over a minute long on studio albums eventually bore me. There were a lot of these drum solos being pumped out on albums back then. \"Lucky Man\" gets slagged a bit, but Lake's contribution to this album remains one of their best known tracks, and is actually the best track on side two. Catchy chorus, friendly guitar solo, folksy vibe that was in vogue at the time. Yet there's still that wild moog attack at the tune's end that brings back the prog and keeps things interesting.ELP have never released a brilliant album in my opinion, but as an important one, this certainly deserves lots of regards. It sort of set the bar up a bit earlier than most in for the prog scene, and remains highly influential."

          "text": "I must confess that I was never a big fan of ELP. Too much keyboards noodling and too little guitar, I guess. However, I cannot deny their importance for rock in general and the prog world in particular. They were truly grounbreakers that merged classical, rock and jazz into a very new kind of sound that defined the 70\ufffds. There were groups that worked those styles before (among them Keith Emerson\ufffds own band prior to ELP, The Nice), but not in such scale of talent and style. Emerson was right when he finished The Nice and looked for the right line up to fit his ideas. So while he and drummer Carl Palmer were technical and trained,. bassist, guitarrist and vocalist Greg Lake (from King Crimson) balanced the sound with nice acoustic songs and warm vocals. This chemistry remains unsurpassed.I heard their debut album many years ago and I bought it again a few weeks ago. And I was astonished by how good it was. I mean, I didn\ufffdt exactly turned into a hardcore fan of them, but it is clear to anyone that their first work was a milestone in rock music when it was released in 1970. They impressed many with their instrumental virtuosity, but they also came with great songs to match, even for radio play. Several of ELP\ufffds more celebrated stuff was introduced here: Take a Pebble, Knife Edge, Tank, Lucky Man. Besides we have other fine epics like the opener The Barbarian and the surprisingly varied suite The Three Fates (I loved the caribbean rhythms included on one of the parts, with a great percussion work done by Palmer). The CD is incredibly well balanced and nothing is really overdone here (like it surely would in years to come). Such an achievement for such young band.It had a good production for the time and the new remasterd edition made it quite perfect.Like King Crimson\ufffds debut, ELP defined the coming of age of an era with its first release, a great promise that was totally fulfilled (all the future excesses included). This CD is not only a great record. It is, along Yes Close to The Edge, Genesis Foxtrot and the aforementioned Crinson\ufffds first, the quintessential work of a new time in music, no less. A classic, essential masterpiece fo progressive rock. Five stars with honours."

          "text": "The debut album of three non-debutants as this is one of the first supergroups in the prog history. Keith Emerson comes from the Nice and the first track of this album \"The Barbarian\" clearly demonstrates it \"from the beginning\". Carl Palmer is the powerful drummer from Atomic Rooster and Gre Lake is the man behind the Crimson's masterpiece 21st Century Schizoid Man.Can you expect a masterpiece from this band?Yes, of course.Reviewing an album of this kind is very hard because finding something that hasn't already been said by somebody else is very uneasy and unlikely to happen.However after the very \"nice\" opener, Greg Lake gifts us of his fantastic voice on \"Take A Pebble\". I'm one of those who think that Lake is one of the greatest singers ever. I think that his voice is the essence of how a prog vocalist should sound and this long song is for me the best of the album and one of the absolutely best songs released by ELP. It contains all the things which have made this band great: a great piano solo, the non-invasive but effective drums and a lot of ideas. Emerson harping directly on the strings of an open grandpiano while Lake plays a 12 strings guitar in an oriental performance that grows into a country-blues piece. An epic track which pays back for the whole album.\"Knife Edge\"'s bass line is something that's fixed in my mind since from the 70s. Sometimes these few notes pop up to my mind unexpectedly. Emerson's keyboards has here that sound that will forever be the band's trademark, so what could I ask more to a five minutes song?Let's switch to Side B (I have the vinyl, of course). The church organ which opens the mini suite \"The Three Fates (Atropos, Clotho and Lachesis)\" is pompous and dark as a church organ only can be and I think this is the track which gave to some Italian directors the idea of hiring Emerson for horror movie's soundtracks. After the initial organ part, the rest of the track is mainly based on piano as Emerson only can play it. I don't want to enter in the polemics about who's the best player between Emerson and Wakeman. I like both and they are just similar but different. This is another track that I love.\"Tank\" became famous in my country because it was used as end title track of a weekly TV magazine. It started from the last minutes of the drum solo until the end, but it was the version taken from Works. Here it's still one of the most famous ELP songs and on the album is followed by the radio-friendly one: Lucky Man.I loved that song but as all the radio-friendly things, I've got a bit tired of it during the years. What I still love of this song is the final keyboard riff that's not so much radio-friendly.The only \"bad\" thing of this album is the presence of very low volume parts, specially on take A Pebble (but even the following albums will have silences and low volume moments). This is a problem when you pretend to listen to the album while driving. It requires headphones and finding the right way to listen to this album was not easy neither cheap in the early 70s.However this is a masterpiece and I still listen to this ELP album (and not to this one only) even after 40 years."

          "text": "For me ELP was always one of the most inconsistent and uneven of the great prog bands of the 70's. Their albums seemed marred and at times unfocused, blending greatness with fillers. Often these fillers appear to have been great fun recording in the studio. A great laugh for all involved but less fun for people like me, having to bear through it or skipping songs, thus breaking the spell.Their first album, however, is interesting in many ways. First off it is sort of crude and raw, bringing forth a musical concoction based on distorted organ, heavy bass and thumping drums. One can easily see how the early phases of prog developed through the adaptation of heavy and hard rock of the late 60's, paving the way for ever more sophistication further into the decade.Secondly I find the first album to be the most consistent. The presence of classical influences are there but first and foremost it is an album of heavy, menacing and powerful prog performed on organ, bass and drums. Magnificent! Especially since I am a great fan of the hammond organ.The first track, The barbarian, hits you right in the face with it's distorted bass and rolls you over, feeling like you've been hit by a train. The second track is a marvellous, multi-part piece called Take a pebble. It seems to have been a live favorite and I can understand why. Very atmospheric and provides a great example of early prog's ability and willingness to expand on musical structure. Knife-edge is similar to The barbarian. It is a hard rock piece. Very heavy and certainly one of my favorites. The three fates is the track where ELP's fascination for classical music comes to the fore. It is a complex, daring piece which opens up with a majestic organ. The track Tank showcases Carl Palmer's amazing drum skills. The album closes with the ballad Lucky man. A nice song, deliverd with emotion and beauty.All in all ELP's first album is a starting point for what is to come later on. It is quite raw but not without sophistication and wealth of music. On this album the focus and concistency is never broken. The magic is there throughout, making it, simply, their best album, although not consisting of their all time best tracks, like Tarkus for instance. A great place to start and certainly a great way to end the day."

          "text": "This is the debut album from this supergroup of stellar musicians. This was to become the outlet for Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer to showcase their musicianship. But, at it's peak, it was more than anything a spotlight for Emerson's spectacular keyboard playing and composing. As you listen to this album, which has been reviewed plenty of times here already, you will notice that everyone gets to shine, but the balance of the spotlight is tilted quite heavily to Emerson, which is fine. His talent has inspired countless musicians and has influenced many people to explore other avenues of music that they normally would not have explored.This album is amazing, especially for a debut album. There is quite a mix of classically inspired rock. The mix of sounds you get here should not be too surprising because of the talent. You start off with \"The Barbarian\" with the full band doing their take on a Bartok composition from 1911; \"Allegro Barbaro\". After this somewhat bombastic instrumental where each band member shows off their talent, an epic track named \"Take a Pebble\" follows. This track has vocals from the amazing voice of Greg Lake. The sections where there is singing is performed by full band, but the very long instrumental break is surprisingly acoustic piano through most of it with a short break for an acoustic guitar solo and a return to the piano with drums joining in eventually. This is a very nice surprise because the sound is amazing and anyone who knows keyboards will be blown away by Emerson's playing. \"Knife Edge\" is another harder edged song again with full band and vocals and is very progressive. It is based on the first movement of Leo? Jan\ufffd\u010dek's Sinfonietta. with a organ solo during the instrumental break that follows Bach's Allamande from the French Suite in D minor.Following this you get two long instrumentals. The first being a suite called \"The Three Fates\" which is definitely another chance for Emerson to show off, of which I have no complaint. This is one of my favorite ELP tracks and probably one of the least known. You get a very cool organ solo on the first movement, and nice piano solo on the 2nd movement, and then the piano gets joined by drums and bass for the third. This is a very progressive number that always gets my heart pounding. This also demonstrates that Emerson is not only an amazing player, but an outstanding composer also. Next is \"Tank\" which is a full band instrumental which spotlights Carl Palmer this time. This is another excellent instrumental with a completely different feel from the last track and a very excellent drum solo in the middle which is not stretched out to a never-ending length. Palmer shares the spotlight with Emerson not only with the instruments but with the composition also. Great stuff. The album ends with the popular Lake folk rock ballad \"Lucky Man\" which features his vocals and guitar and ends with Emerson on synth that was overdubbed on the end so that everyone would know (on the radio) that this is not a Lake solo. Good song, but not very indicative of the rest of their sound and I'm sure a lot of people were surprised when they heard the song on the radio, bought the album and heard something they were not expecting. But it worked for the band and made them hugely popular and that popularity continued for several years.Anyway, this is an excellent album that introduced a lot of people to the challenging music of progressive rock. In that way, it is essential in that it helped bring a lot of rock lovers around to becoming interested in classical music and a more sophisticated style of popular music. The importance of this album in rock music can not be denied. ELP would go on to produce some other great albums and some trashy ones too, but their influence in progressive and popular music is still felt today. Essential album. 5 stars."

          "text": "Review N\ufffd 15This is my second review of an Emerson, Lake & Palmer's album. The first was their debut live album 'Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends'. I chose review their eponymous debut studio album 'Emerson, Lake & Palmer', released in 1970, as my first studio review of them, because is my favourite studio work from the group.The three band members came from three very well established bands, before they joined together. All of them were very talented musicians and very experienced too. Greg Lake came from a band that needs no introduction. He came from King Crimson and was one of their founder members. King Crimson are simply and undoubtedly, one of the best and most innovative progressive bands ever. He took part on their two first studio albums, 'In The Court Of The Crimson King' and 'In The Wake Of Poseidon'. Carl Palmer came from Atomic Rooster and he was also one of their founder members. Atomic Rooster is a British heavy progressive band. He has only participated on their debut eponymous studio album 'Atomic Rooster'. Finally, Keith Emerson came from The Nice and he was one of their founder members too. The Nice was a British symphonic progressive band who has combined classical, jazz, blues and rock music. Their music became the seeds of what will be the sound of Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He took part on all their four studio albums 'The Thoughts Of Emerlist Davjack', 'Ars Longa Vita Brevis', 'The Nice' and 'Elegy'.Curiously, Emerson, Lake & Palmer could have been called HELP or Hendrix, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, if Jimi Hendrix had adhered to the project. It seems that Hendrix was tired of his own band and wanted to try something different and new. So supposedly, he expressed an interest in playing with them. However, because of scheduling conflicts, such idea couldn't be immediately held, and unfortunately, Hendrix died shortly after. However, the history was never confirmed. It even was contradicted by Lake, saying that it was just a rumour created by the press.The front cover of the album depicts a fluttering white bird with a human ear in the bottom left corner. It was painted by Nic Dartnell and it seems that originally was for the Spirit, an American proto-prog band. It also seems that the figure man on the left of the cover is the Spirit drummer, Ed Cassidy. However, the artist denied, in an interview.'Emerson, Lake & Palmer' has six tracks. The first track 'Barbarian', despite being attributed to the trio, is a musical arrangement of a Bela Bartok's piano piece, named 'Allegro Barbaro'. Although, the original piece be only for piano, the band rearranged the song for organ, bass and drums. This is a great aggressive track with a hard rock influence. The second track 'Take A Pebble' is a beautiful ballad by Lake, and is the lengthiest track on the album. This is a magnificent song with the powerful vocals of Lake. His singing is simply terrific, with the final line of the verses building on the legacy of King Crimson's 'Epitaph', which sounds even better. The third track 'Knife-Edge' is based on the first movement of Leos Janacek's 'Sinfonietta'. This is another great piece of music with a great showcase by all the three band members, with particular emphasis to the great bass lines. The fourth track 'The Three Fates' is an Emerson's concept piece of music, about the meaning of life, god and evil. The suite is divided into three parts. 'Clotho', an organ solo recorded at the Royal Festival Hall, 'Lachesis', a piano solo and 'Atropos', a piano trio. This is technically an excellent piece of music that showcases the rare musical talents of Emerson. The fifth track 'Tank' contains a Carl Palmer's small and beautiful solo studio drumming. Basically, the piece showcases Palmer's unique drumming style and features one of the few drum solos on a studio album. It also marks the first appearance of the Emerson's famous Moog synthesizer. The sixth track 'Lucky Man' is a ballad written by Lake for acoustic guitar, when he was a schoolboy. However, at the beginning, the song wasn't well received by Emerson and Palmer. It's a song with acoustic guitar, beautiful singing and a great synthesizer solo towards the end. It's, for me, one of the best songs ever written by Lake, and it became as one of the band's most commercial and accessible tracks.Conclusion: 'Emerson, Lake & Palmer' is an excellent album, very fluent and very beautiful, with moody keyboards, memorable guitar lines, immaculate drumming, and above all, a great vocal work by Lake. It also still features very strong compositions and a magnificent and inspired musicianship. Emerson takes the band's music a little too strongly in his own hands on many occasions on the album. His virtuoso skills have become the defining factor on the band's music. However, fantastic musicians such as Lake and Palmer deserve certainly also a more prominent spot. Sincerely, and in my humble opinion, this album is with 'Brain Salad Surgery' the two best studio works from the group, only supplanted by their triple live album 'Welcome back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends'.Prog is my Ferrari.

          "text": "Emerson Lake & Palmer was formed by a keyboardist Keith Emerson, who departed from The Nice, Greg Lake, a bass player of King Crimson and Carl Palmer, who previously had played with Atomic Rooster and The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown. Needless to say, ELP have become synonymous with the term \"prog rock\" being one of the best known bands in the genre. What really is a proof of the \"chemistry\" between the musicians of the supergroup is that they released their debut slightly over half a year after meeting. This was intended as a collaborative recording session work, but ELP couldn't part their ways with just that. So, that's how the band was formed.Emerson Lake & Palmer have a distinctive style of their own that blends jazz approach to classical music. This is best visible on their variations on themes by Bela Bartok (\"Barbarian\") or Leos Janacek and J. S. Bach (both on \"Knife Edge\"). Their music is characterized by unbelievable amounts of vigour, energy as well as musical intelligence. The great late Keith Emerson is the wizard of keyboards and a phenomenal composer. Greg Lake's unmistakable tear-bringing vocals has become one of audience's favorites. In addition, Lake is a proficient bassist capable of moody grooves. Carl Palmer is an excellent drummer with great playing dynamics. Enough said, the musicianship of this debut album is outstanding.Emerson Lake & Palmerconsists of six tracks. The band seems to have organized the time perfectly. This work goes from English renaissance folk ballads like \"Lucky Man\", through Emerson's triple-movement suite \"Three Fates\" or jazzy improvisation over classical quotes on \"Knife Edge\" to almost proto-metal opening on \"Barbarian\". The variety is great, because it does not show the common inconsistence that many debuts have with too much of a variety. At times, the music loses itself and becomes a bit repetative and sterile, which is a shame.All in all, this is a classic prog album, so it's obviously a much needed addition to every collection of the genre's fan. This work majestically represents the early years of symphonic rock subgenre as well as progressive rock in general and despite being slightly flawed here and there, it is highly recommended, Many amazing and unforgettable moments!Four stars!"

          "text": "After an onslaught of Dream Theater reviews that honestly left me burnt out on everything to do with the band for the time being, I decided to just stop with them for the time being and move onto a band that I have extremely mixed opinions on, Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Overall, I find the band to have a very particular sound to them unlike much other prog at the time, with much more on the nose classical influence to the point of reimagining various classical pieces, an extreme focus on keyboards and drums, and an all around more energetic, chaotic, jam focused sound to them. Out of all the classic prog bands, this is easily one of the most pompous and excessive of them all, only issue being that it only works some of the time, an issue present through every one of their albums. Their debut is definitely their most restrained work by an extremely wide margin, but even here, there is still a lot of time dedicated to simply showing off the incredible talent of the band members, rather than on making enjoyable music. Both Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer are extremely skilled at their respective instruments, and Greg Lake is one of my favourite vocalists, but the music itself is quite a mixed bag, with a lot of it sounding like more work could have been done in order to polish things significantly.Despite the band largely providing its riffs and melody through the keyboards, The Barbarian kicks off the album with a sludgy guitar tone, before increasing in speed, starting off slowly before the beat evolves into a gallop. I love the way everything cuts out in order for the frenetic drumming and tense piano playing to come in, providing the mental image of being chased, at least to me. I love the intensity of this song, and it's without a doubt one of my favourite songs on the album, and is at the very least, what I'd consider to be the most perfect. Take A Pebble is a very different affair however, starting off very strongly, highly reminiscient of the earlier King Crimson ballads such as the first couple of minutes of Moonchild, with similarly amazing vocals and an overall powerful beauty to it. The issue here is that a lot of the middle instrumental section feels very unecessary, being quite dull with what I consider to be fairly unappealing country - blues section that feels as if it comes out of nowhere and lasts far too long. In a way, I guess I can compare it to Moonchild, both starting out excellently before devolving into pure boredom, with any magic the song contained being drained away. Knife Edge proves to fare far better, being a pleasant, bluesy song with much more restraint placed upon it, with nothing getting too out of hand, and some really great concepts explored, especially the baroque section, which is simply to die for. The song feels a bit stilted in placed, but is definitely enjoyable.The Three Fates feels like the polar opposite of Knife Edge, with it sounding like the band just decided to abandon all restraint and see how much punishment their instruments could take before they broke. What is created from this is a wonderfully chaotic instrumental that switches between mildly dull to downright awesome, the latter being much more prominent in the third movement of the song, and at the very least, it's simply more proof that Keith Emerson is incredible on his respecitve instruments (if it was somehow not already extremely obvious from everything else here), but once again, the song could have used a bit of trimming. Tank is definitely an interesting song, having some of the greatest instrumental interplay that the band has ever composed in my opinion, with an amazing driving energy behind it. The issue here is that once again, the excessive, pompous side of the band ends up getting the better of it in the form of a 2 minute drum solo which becomes almost painfully dull by the end. I honestly want a version of this song with a shortened version of the drum solo, as this would otherwise be one of my absolute favourite songs by the band if not for how much the energy is ruined. Lucky Man is definitely a beautiful track and one that I can quite easily see how it became the most popular, well known song by the band, as it's peacful, melodic, and absolutely beautiful. There is nowhere near the same amount of chaos and intensity as previous songs, but does close off in a way that sums up the whole album very well, with a poorly conceived moog solo that disrupts the beauty, although the song is still incredible despite this.Overall, while 5 of the 6 songs on this album are good overall (Take A Pebble, not so much), almost all of them are flawed in the same general way, with the exception of The Barbarian. Each of them could have used further editing and polishing to make for some really great listening, as the songs all have incredible potential in one way or another. As it stands though, while I do really enjoy listening to this album, I often end up becoming mildly irritated at the many flaws it has, which is definitely enough for me to knock this down to 3 stars. I'd highly recommend this album to those who enjoy heavily classical influenced music and also can get behind a lot of excess. This is definitely their most restrained album of their peak material, which is honestly a good thing in certain respects when looking at some of their later efforts where they allowed their pretentiousness to go unchecked.Best songs: The Barbarian, Knife Edge, Lucky ManWeakest songs: Take A PebbleVerdict: Highly technical, complex muwsic that has a habit of becoming too overtly complex for its own good. Songs can both have moments of genius, and moments of ill conceived noodling, but for the most part, it's an entertaining album overall, albeit very flawed in certain respects."

          "text": "After finishing the Nice experience, Keith Emerson joins the great drummer Carl Palmer, the excellent singer and bassist Greg Lake, and founds Emerson, Lake & Palmer, a group that since the name highlights the three singularities of the artists who are part of it, and who there will be some three soloists playing together. Their first Lp, definitely one of the most important in the history of symphonic progressive rock, is qualitatively controversial, let's see why.1) \"The Barbarian\". First instrumental song inspired by Bartok's Allegro Barbaric, it starts as a heavy metal piece, then Emerson gives vent to his virtuosity, and Palmer tends to overdoing, then comes a piece played by the piano more adhering to Bartok's original, then the heavy metal sound returns for the ending, that is too pompous. Beautiful reimagining, never monotonous, just a little repetitive and bombastic in some passages. Rating 7.5/8.2) \"Take A Pebble\". Acoustic ballad written by Lake, with country inflections, where Lake sings up to 2'30''; then comes a long instrumental piece of very nice pastoral atmosphere, dictated by Lake's guitar; then at about 6'30' is Emerson's piano to lead, joined by Palmer's drums towards 8'30'. At that point the song becomes prolish and jazzy. Lake's voice returns at 11'20'' and restores balance. It's the best piece on the album, the one and only masterpiece. Rating 8.5.3) \"Knife-Edge\". Hard-rock song, with a good aggressive beginning, quotes Janacek with the organ in the instrumental part. Repetetive in the ending. Good but not excellent. Rating 7+.End of Side A.Side B begins with a mini-suite in three movements: \"The Three Fates\", written by Emerson. A solemn beginning with the organ, then the piano arrives and the song improves; finally Palmer arrives, the song becomes jazzy and pedantic, too percussive and obsessively repetitive. It's a piece with some good ideas, especially in the middle, but overall it is not quite successful, the listening isn't very pleasent. Rating 6.5.\"Tank\" is another instrumental track led by Emerson and Palmer, more unpredictable than the previous one but also more spoiled by the style exercises played by Palmer and Emerson: decidedly the weakest piece (euphemism) of the album, which with the last two tracks has dropped dramatically in quality after the promising start (the first two songs). Ratin 5+.With \"Lucky Man\" fortunately Lake brings the music back to more relaxed atmospheres. Simple and linear piece, less beautiful than the second, progressive only in the arrangement. Emerson buns in the ending. Rating 7+.Qualitatively, this Lp is a long way from the masterpiece: this album can keep up with the best of 1970 only for the first two pieces, then otherwise it's mediocre. Rating 7+ (average 7,08); Three poor stars. If there weren't the first two pieces, it would take two stars."

In combining melodies and structures from classical music with rock & roll energy and instrumentation, they successfully brought together the European and North-American traditions of Western music and created a completely unique kind of music.Keith Emerson, the band's driving force who was nicknamed the Hendrix of the Hammond organ, originally rose to fame as keyboard player of The Nice, which can be seen as a \"proto-ELP\" of sorts. It was an innovative rock band characterized by the prevalence of Emerson's keyboards and his bizarre antics on stage. Live performances of The Nice contained lengthy, virtuosic organ solos in which Emerson would stab knives into his instrument to hold down notes, or jump over his organ to play Bach's Toccata & Fugue in D Minor? while standing behind his instrument.While The Nice's sound already contained a prototype of the rock/jazz/classical fusion that would become ELP's trademark, Emerson envisioned a far more ambitious project and left the band in 1970 before forming a new group with singer/guitarist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer. Greg Lake had been an unknown until he provided lead vocals and bass guitar for King Crimson's widely acclaimed 1969 debut album In The Court Of The Crimson King. His unique voice contributed to the celestial atmosphere of that album and would become a staple in ELP's sound. Carl Palmer on the other hand had previously made a name for himself as drummer in Arthur Brown's band, and later in the hard rock band Atomic Rooster. Aside from his skills at beating the hell out of his drum kit, he would also become known for his extensive arsenal of additional percussion, including a set of timpanis, tubular bells, two giant gongs and a bell that he could play with his mouth. The trio quickly acquired a record contract and kick-started their career by firing three cannons on stage at the Isle Of Wight Festival in August, 1970. Two months later, they released their first, eponymous, album, with which they wanted to smack their audience in the face and show them all that they were capable of at once. The album starts off right away with an example of the kind of rock/classical fusion the band would become known for: \"The Barbarian\". It's a cover of B\ufffdla Bart\ufffdk's \"Allegro Barbaro\" which is a piano solo piece, but you know you're in for something of an entirely different nature when you first hear the ominous fuzzy bass notes that open the album. Bart\ufffdk's original piece has been transformed into a roaring apocalyptic tune, dominated by Emerson's furious organ barrage that more than compensates for the absence of guitars, before giving way to the relatively quiet piano-driven midsection, which follows the original more closely. But the tension keeps building up until the introduction is reprised again, and afterwards the song ends with a \"call-and-answer\" duel between the screaming organ and Palmer's impeccable drum blasts.Too rough for you? Don't worry, cause the boys try to create a number of different moods on this album, and the next song couldn't be more different from its predecessor. \"Take A Pebble\" starts off as a beautiful piano ballad on which Greg Lake gets to shine with his heavenly vocals. However, the song is extended to no less than twelve minutes with some acoustic guitar plucking by Lake and a prolonged piano improvisation from Emerson. This might be one of the best showcases of Emerson's amazing keyboard talent: for several minutes, he plays the same eight-note ostinato with his left hand while playing masterful licks with his right hand, seamlessly varying between classically influenced chops and typically jazzy note sequences.\"Knife-Edge\" is much more straight-forward, as it actually has a verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus structure (more or less). The instrumentation is also much closer to conventional rock music, despite the fact that Emerson's organ is once again the dominant instrument. The main melody is borrowed from Jan\ufffd\u010dek's Sinfonietta, but it's presented in such a way that it becomes its own thing entirely. It rocks!Now, while the first three tracks perfectly capture the trio's strength as a group, the next three tracks are rather meant to display the individual talents of each musician. If you're an Emerson fan, you're in luck because he's the only band member who's present on the first two parts of \"The Three Fates\". This starts off as a purely classical composition, beginning with an introduction on organ before moving to another beautiful piano passage, less ethereal than the one on \"Take A Pebble\", but more complex and engaging. While the piece shows influence from composers such as Chopin and Ravel, Emerson refrains from directly quoting other compositions, plus he again incorporates chromatic jazz scales to avoid it sounding too derivative. Then, in the final part, Lake and Palmer finally join in to bring the piece to a chaotic ending.\"Tank\" puts Palmer in the spotlight, but it's sadly not as interesting as what came before. The focus of the song is his drum solo, which he uses in part to show off his aforementioned percussion set, but for the most part it's just an erratic collection of kicks and snares without much rhyme or reason. The song was mainly meant for live performances where the effect could indeed be impressive, and its inclusion on this album would be rather pointless if it weren't for the catchy, jazzy clavinet and synth solos that bookend it and turn it into a memorable composition in its own right.Finally, \"Lucky Man\" is an acoustic folksy song written by Lake when he was twelve years old. It's probably the most normal song on the album. Emerson doesn't show up at all until the last minute when he throws in a solo with the undiluted square wave oscillator of his newly acquired Moog Synthesizer. It doesn't fit with the rest of the song at all but it gives a pretty hilarious effect. \"Lucky Man\" was the band's first single and its most well-known song to this day, which is unfortunate because it does not represent the band's style very well. I even happened to hear it on the radio the day after Keith Emerson's death in 2016, and the station was nice enough to cut out the synth solo in its entirety, thus completely removing his contribution to the song. Maybe it was meant to be symbolic?...In all, the album as a whole feels a little unfocused, but the individual songs are just so strong. All of these weird rhythms and song structures will probably take some time to get used to, and I realize that many may shake their head at the prospect of listening to a twelve-minute song (look out, by the way: \"Take A Pebble\" is far from the longest track ELP ever recorded?), but if you allow it to sink in you can't help but be enthralled by it in the end. At the very least you have to acknowledge the talent and the ambition of the musicians and songwriters at work."

          "text": "'Emerson, Lake & Palmer' was certainly the start of something beautiful. The newly-formed prog supergroup, combining the forces of Greg Lake from King Crimson, Keith Emerson from The Nice and Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster, was set to champion the up-and-coming genre with their adventurous sounds and the classical crossover direction that was strongly influenced by their keyboard maestro. This first album by the trio was released in November of 1970 on the Island label, and was produced by their own Greg Lake.At this point, this is a seriously important album both for the band, and for the whole movement, massively influential and groundbreaking, the insane playing of Keith Emerson was what truly sets ELP apart from many of their peers. Writing rock arrangements for classical pieces, amongst some hard rock-influenced numbers, and occasional acoustic moments, the band already displayed an original and recognizable sound with their very first release.Some absolutely fantastic compositions on this self-titled debut, amongst them we have to mention the opening track 'The Barbarian', based on Bela Bartok's 'Allegro barbaro' - a beautiful and energetic rendition by the band, with everyone playing masterfully, the haunting 'Knife-Edge', that is the band's first tread on some hard rock ground, with the prevailing manic Hammond organ, and the enormous and menacing instrumental 'The Three Fates' - this is absolutely Emerson going crazy and displaying his full potential on the keys. 'Take a Pebble' is another very good composition, maybe a bit aloof in the middle section, eventually slightly prolonged, but nonetheless memorable and touching. 'Lucky Man' has to be one of the all-time most recognizable songs of ELP, a highlight of Greg Lake's charming writing. 'Tank', however, has some pretty ridiculous sounds that have hardly aged well; it must be noted though, that it is a mood that is often copied by other bands, some in the 80s and some 21st century collectives.All in all, this record is extremely influential, very menacing, and pretty impressive. It is hardly, however, a perfect album. It has its wacky moments, which you sometimes get with prog rock, but it also has some of the most excellent material that this musical genre has ever offered. The artwork is iconic, the band are playing their hearts out, and all this contributes to making Emerson, Lake & Palmer's self-titled debut a must-listen!"

          "text": "Taking modern classical music as their main source of inspiration and adding elements and nuances of their own, Emerson, Lake & Palmer debut with a solid album, with the trio's surnames as title, backed by their previous successful experiences (Greg Lake's participation as singer and bassist in the fundamental \"In the Court of the Crimson King\" by King Crimson in 1969 is very notorious).Virtuosos almost on the verge of a nervous breakdown, it is, however, the brilliant multi-keyboardist Keith Emerson the main protagonist of most of the pieces, both in the adaptations of classical music (the instrumental and over- saturated \"The Barbarian\" and the demanding \"Knife-Edge\"), as well as in those of their own label (the extensive and restful \"Take a Pebble\", surely on the podium of the best of the album), or the also instrumental and jazzy \"The Three Fates\" and \"Tank\", in both cases with the impeccable percussion of the remarkable Carl Palmer.The mole of the album was exposed when Lake, with his grave and serene tone of voice, describes an unfortunate story in the imperishable and beautiful ballad \"Lucky Man\". Created by the singer and bassist in his early teens and included at the last minute on the album, it unexpectedly became for EL&P one of their most representative songs, and the moog at the end of the song, an Emerson improvisation that remained as is after only one take, in one of the most celebrated passages of their discography.Emerson, Lake &Palmer developed their own particular style until becoming one of the great icons of the genre without any transitional albums, placing themselves at the top of the progressive Olympus with their 1970 album of the same name, something that they would confirm with their later works.Excellent4/4.5 stars"

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "genre": "Symphonic Prog",
      "country": "United Kingdom",
      "biography": "Formed in London, UK in 1970 - Disbanded in 1979 - Regrouped between 1991-1998 - Reunited briefly in 2010\n\nELP revolutionized the 70's rock scene by introducing a new line-up format. This fact really mattered due to each musician's geniality and unlimited talent that, put together, generated a level of music never achieved by anybody else as of yet. All of the musicians came from established bands before joining forces together:\n\nGreg LAKE\n\ncame from\n\nKING CRIMSON\n\n,\n\nCarl PALMER\n\ncame from\n\nATOMIC ROOSTER\n\n, and\n\nKeith EMERSON\n\ncame from\n\nTHE NICE\n\n.\n\nThey explored their capabilities to an extreme, even with the technology limitations of the early 70's, breaking ground, setting the new parameters for a new vein in the english pop music (at the time) which would be called progressive music. ELP released 10 outstanding albums during the 70's, and after a long break, they got back in the 90's with a new approach, but still making good music. In 1986\n\nCozy POWELL\n\nreplaced PALMER and they put together EMERSON, LAKE and POWELL, a good effort as well.\n\nThey've pushed their ambitions over-the-edge. On \"Tarkus\" the title suite was an inventive and edgy suite revolving around jazzy textures. Their most popular album \"Brain Salad Surgery\", was their most grandiose and refined. Next, the more adventurous listener might try \"Trilogy\" or ELP's self-titled first album. In my opinion, these four albums form the core of ELP's best material. Other good ELP albums include \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", their provocative, fiery and intense take on a classical work. and \"Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends\", a triple-live album (now on double-CD) with some absolutely stunning playing.\n\n2016 was a sad year for Prog fans, because Keith and Greg left us, Rest in Peace and thank you for everything\n\nBeing that some albums belong to a different band with only two members of ELP, we have to make this addition:\n\nEmerson, Lake & Powell\n\n(Active between 1985-1986)\n\nEmerson, Lake & Powell, often abbreviated to ELPowell, were an offshoot of a classic prog band Emerson, Lake & Palmer with Cozy Powell taking over the drumming duites in place of Carl Palmer which released one self-titled album in 1986.\n\nAfter releasing Love Beach in 1978 Emerson, Lake & Palmer became silent for a couple of years until Emerson and Lake met during summer 1985 inspired by Jim Lewis, a vice-president of Polydor Records, and discussed a joint project. Since Carl Palmer was still contracted to Asia and was unable to participate they had to find a substitute and after auditioning several drummers they eventually chose a long time Emerson's friend Cozy Powell. The band have always insisted that it was a coincidence that his surname also happened to start with a P, thus allowing the band to keep its original initials.\n\nEmerson Lake & Powell released their debut LP in 1986 and began rehearsing in England for a US tour. The band's sole album was reminiscent of ELP style, with long suites, mellow ballads and a classical theme (Mars, the Bringer of War by Gustav Holst). Studio outtakes, demos and rehearsals that didn't make it to the official studio album were offered as a mail-order, limited-edition vinyl album, titled Space Gospel, to members of the EMERSON LAKE AND POWELL FAN CLUB.  Most ordered copies of this were never delivered though, due to the bankruptcy of the fulfillment house used by ELP.\n\nThe US tour began in El Paso, Texas on August 15 and continued until October 30th. The tour was difficult and marred by a dispute which led to the band firing its management. Shortly after it ended the band disbanded without recording a second album.\n\nSome ELPowell studio rehearsals and live recordings were made available as bootlegs in the 1990s. The material was subsequently remastered and given an official release on two 2003 CDs, available via the ELP website: The Sprocket Sessions (rehearsal tapes) (2003), Live in Concert (recorded live in Lakeland, Florida, November 1986) (2003).\n\nDiscography:\n\nEmerson, Lake & Powell  (1986),\n\nSpace Gospel  (Demos 1985, limited edition for members of the EMERSON LAKE AND POWELL FAN CLUB),\n\nThe Sprocket Sessions  (rehearsal tapes) (2003),\n\nLive in Concert  (recorded live in Lakeland, Florida, November 1986) (2003).\n\nBartlomiej Slazak - Tuzvihar",

          "text": "If somebody wants to know what Italian symphonic rock was, this conceptual album is the perfect definition. One of the best of the prog music ever. The story tells about the people from two planets, one sad, another happy, but music -since the first second- can transport the listener to a full emotions world. Sometimes pompous, sometimes soft, and always emotive. Lots of keyboards, powerful drums, magnificent bass and impressive clear voice conforming a really beautiful work. \"Sospesi Nell'Incredibile\" open the album, and when you'll hear it by the first time, you'll know you are in front of a masterpiece. With \"Ritorno Al Nulla\", the last track, you'll confirm it. I don't have words to describe such beauty, I just can say that this would be one of those six stars rated albums. A must!"

          "text": "This is considered by many to be the pinnacle Le ORME recording of all time and I must agree. Gorgeous organ/mellotron led symphonic prog with great musicianship aka Le ORME. Like so many great recordings Le ORME use sound to its fullest creating some unbelievable proggy moments with a heavy emphasis on the classic sound of piano and song structure. Like all Le ORME recordings this is far too short in length and is really a let down when it ends. The songs are very well constructed and written which do not sound dated really considering the age of the recording. \"Felona E Serona\" is a moody piece and seems to cover a wide spectrum of emotions!"

          "text": "Another classic, with the contribution by Peter HAMMILL and the best dark imprinting by Le ORME; a beautiful suite, sometimes prolix, but often memorable too. The work at his bass guitar, well supported by the rhythmical section, is excellent and let Aldo Tagliapietra stand like an Italian version of Greg LAKE - among so many stars within the progressive scene - (except on the vocals which are different), whose production was aligned to those ones from the seventies and quite good anyway. However it should be worth as a \"4 stars issue\" once again, but its importance as a secure standard reference for such Italian \"Dark Progressive\", makes this album essential.Recommended dark \"GIFT\"...!"

          "text": "I remembered the first Le ORME album I ever bought. It was \"Ad Gloriam\", an odd pick given that album isn't what you call progressive (it was psychedelic pop). The next Le ORME album I got was \"Felona e Sorona\", and I couldn't be more surprised how different this album sounded. They had already released two albums in the prog vein (\"Collage\", which seems to only get a lukewarm response, and \"Uomo di Pezza\", where response is much greater), with just three guys, Aldo Tagliapietra, Michi dei Rossi, and Toni Pagliuca (the two guys from the early years had long since left the band). Without a doubt, \"Felona e Sorona\" is Le ORME at the top of their game, going for a concept about two opposing planets.The album opens up with \"Sospesi Nell'Incredibile\", which is by far one of the best things Le ORME had ever done. There are some lengthy instrumental passages here, plus some electronic effects played on Pagliuca's Moog, while Michi dei Rossi goes wild on his drums. The next piece is \"Felona\", an upbeat acoustic piece, with that tone, you can be sure the inhabitants of the planet Felona are upbeat. \"La Solitudine di chi Protegge il Mondo\" is simply a piano-oriented piece with Tagliapietra's unmistakable voice. I, for some reason, especially the piano section, got reminded of ENYA's soundtrack album to \"The Celts\" (her debut, that is), which is weird, since neither of them hardly sound alike, not to mention the more than one decade gap (Le ORME used Moog and string synths, while ENYA used lots of mid-80s digital synths, Le ORME being prog, ENYA being New Age with Celtic trappings). \"L'Equilibrio\" is the closest to them sounding like ELP on this album, especially the piano section.By the way, on this album, don't buy in to Le ORME as being an Italian ELP, as much of the ELP influences of their previous two albums have all but disappeared. \"Sorona\" has a more somber tone, every time I hear this, I can't help but be reminded of PULSAR's \"Halloween\", although that album wouldn't appear until 1977. You can be certain that the inhabitants of the planet Sorona tend to be downbeat and somber, judging on the tone of the song. \"Attesa Inerte\" tends to be a more experimental piece, with some disturbing use of synths. \"All'Infuori del Tempo\" is another acoustic piece in the vein of \"Felona\". A bit repetitive, I took me a bit to get used to. The final piece is the instrumental \"Ritorno al Nulla\" is an all-instrumental piece dominated by synthesizers. Without a doubt, \"Felona e Sorona\" is an essential Italian prog album, and definately the album to start if you're not familiar with Le ORME."

          "text": "I definitely can't care less about thinking over how many stars I'm supposed to give to this album and without hesitating, not once, I came up with the whole five stars. It's not about being relentless about my opinion, it's just that I just couldn't leave out a single detail from this masterful album.The first album I ever got from LE ORME was \"Florian\" and then \"Ad Gloriam\" came to my hands; \"Felona E Sorona\" is completely different from that psychedelic yet absurd style LE ORME seized upon to get known in the prog world. This album mustn't be compared to some other pieces from this band or other Italian prog bands whatsoever, I think this recording is a medullar point to compare most of the bands who encouraged themselves to play symphonic prog rock.\"Attesa Inerte\" is a gem within another, so moody and powerful, provocative and enticing. I usually end up my reviews recommending those bands appealed to the one I'm reviewing at the time, but for the first time I won't. LE ORME's work cannot be compared to anything, many of you will say maybe close to BMS or PFM, but I'll totally disagree. \"Felona E Sorona\" is outstanding, incredible, a must in any italo prog rock fan collection."

          "text": "What an interesting idea: a concept album about two contrasting planets, a sort of yin and yang (except that, from the album cover, the female is the lighter side and the male the darker side, which is the opposite of yin and yang). The fascinating cover - which has obviously had some thought put into it - clearly illustrates the contrast, with haunting blue-tint male and female figures shown from the front and back. Even though I understand very little Italian, the lyrics sound fascinating - I can clearly hear Aldo Tagliapietra telling a fluid story, and you really get the feeling of an epic being recounted.This is melodious keyboard-centric music, but the guitars, drums and other percussion provide critical support and on several occasions come to the fore. There is reasonably frequent, very electronic synth but it does not sound gratuitous or out of place, just atmospheric. Given the relative sophistication of the music, it's somewhat of a surprise that just three musicians were involved. It's not the sort of flowing, rich melodious music of LOCANDA DELLE FATE (which is also haunting, but in a more romantic way) or PFM though - the atmospheric melodies sounding deeper in the most part, but not depressing or heavy in my opinion.The first track ('Sospesi Nell'Incredibile') is often mentioned in the same breath as the album, and is touted as its best track. However to me it's just the start of the feast, as the rest of the album - to me at least - is just as good if not better. A long 'marching' intro on the first track preludes the pleasant, clear singing voice of Aldo Tagliapietra, which is not rough at all (unlike some male Italian rock and pop singers). Towards the end of the track the tune gets a bit repetitive and is less sophisticated.The short second track ('Felona') is brilliant - I just love it and couldn't care less that it was the obvious single. It's happy, bright, starts with a peel of bells, has lovely vocals with some flute coming in later, and sounds a bit like an Italian folk tune. I can more or less follow the lyrics on this one, and they're poetry. It's LE ORME's '\ufffd Festa'. This song makes me think of going for a walk on a sunny morning. I just can't help whistling along to it.The remaining tracks flow one into the other as the story is told, and it's just one long trail of good music which feels very tied to the story. I wish I could get my hands on a good English translation of the Italian lyrics so that I could follow it properly. I'm not going to analyse here each track individually, precisely because they feel so unified. But I will say that the keyboards (often synth), acoustic and electric guitar, drums and other percussion are just as pleasing and symphonic throughout these tracks as on the first track, with vocals usually right up front telling the story.Well, if any album can be called symphonic Progressive Rock, it's this one. It's not in the four-part format of a classical symphony, but it does have the feel of a symphony and the last track even ends in a drawn out, very classical symphony sounding way, albeit with lots of synth. If I had to compare LE ORME on this album to any of the Anglo-Saxon Progressive Rock bands then it would not be EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER, that's for sure, but early GENESIS - I'm reminded of \"Foxtrot\" in places, even to the mood of the music.How to rank this album? Although I like it very much, it's just a sliver short of perfect for me. Although there are several exquisite moments, I would have liked the music to have a few more memorable moments - a few more peaks, and there are just a couple of less sophisticated musical parts that I don't like quite so much. I would have really liked to rate this at 4.5 stars if such a thing were possible, but will go with 4 stars instead of 5 (probably regretting it later). Nevertheless, don't hesitate to get it if you want to experience really good Italian Progressive Rock. It oozes quality in my opinion."

          "text": "The Footprint (le orme) is a trio that souldn't be a quartet. We like it like that. Like Rush or ELP...you can taste the competence in every song. The keyboard is leading the march, but not like ELP. This is spacey, galaxianesque, interstellar keyboard. It reminds me the feel of old 70's movies with a spaceship in a travelling perspective (think of the beginning of Star Wars). I really can imagine myself in the cockpit of an intergalactical ship with a disco shirt. The drumming is superior and kinda flashy by moments, but it does not ruin anything, hopefully. The story, in my point of view, is interesting despite the opinion of everyone else. This is the first italian album that the singer's voice don't get on my nerves. In fact, he sings simply and from the heart. And his voice is a pleasure to be heard. He don't overdo anything and it's full of emotions. At many times, we feel clearly the urge or the despair or the joy from the singing AND the keyboards. The vocal part of the first track is heart-wrenching. But not sad...just melancholic. Talk about a joyful ride with the track Felona. Inspiring, to say the least. Simple but VERY effective. The last track is intense. Lots of emphasis on the synths and it feels like a countdown of self-destruction device on a spaceship, with a feminine voice informing you how much time you have to escape...just like in the first Alien movie."

          "text": "I fear for my life just being the first to give a three star to this album but I don't understand why everyone points to this album as Le Orme's ultimate and best work. It seems (I don't know their discography and history well ) that this is their sole album where they are down to a trio (Kb trio). And unfortunately for me, I am not a great fan of Kb trio (ELP, Triumvirat , Egg , Refugee , Nice etc...) so this is the reason for that rating. What I heard on this album is ELP-ish and requires too much my forced intellectual involvment (some more complicated and destructured music require less effort in listening for this weird guy) and actually this album slides-by without my noticing it if I let my attention slip away, si I decided to try one more album - but not as a trio - before making a decision whether to like this band or not. Progressive , this album is certainly and it is also full of virtuosity but is that last one used advicely?"

          "text": "This is Le Orme at their most chilling and mesmerizing: I am with the majority at indicating \"Felona e Sorona\" as this Italian former trio's masterpiece album. This is a concept album about two twin planets (the bright, joyful Felona, and the somber, hopeless Sorona), which stand located on both extremes of the Cosmos in order to keep the balance of the Universe the way that the Supreme God had created it. The metaphysical implications of this concept is perfectly related to the ethereal air conveyed by most of the synth sounds (for instance, 'Attesa Inerte') and the somewhat mystic drive that is used in some of the most explosive passages of the album (the best example is 'Ritorno al Nulla'). Being as they were a keyboard-based power trio, it is only natural (or almost) the ELP thing happened to be certainly influential in the maturation of Le Orme's sound, but the result was not properly ELP- ish. On the contrary, Le Orme managed to keep a distinct Mediterranean sensibility in their softer, bucolic numbers, as well as a homeland Baroque spirit in their most pompous ones - this is something they could call their own, while maintaining a link to the symphonic prog movement that was taking place in the British scene (I also notice some touch of Genesis as another major Anglo-Saxon influence on them). The superb musicianship and the fluid interplay that is continuously exposed help to build a strong connection between the repertoire and the listener: the inventiveness of the musical ideas and the cleverness of the arrangements are perfectly complemented by an emotional richness portrayed in both Tagliapietra's singing and the threesome's instrumental performances. My only personal complaint is concerning the sound production, which is a bit tiny: perhaps the strength of the material doesn't show its full potentiality. The opening track is one of the most impressive ones: 'Sospesi nell'Incredibile' comprises a combination of rocking energy, reflective mood, and an exuberant closure where power trio prog and jazz rock melt together in a sonic nucleus - amazing (but only moderately pyrotechnical) drum solo by Dei Rossi included. The folkish kind simplicity of 'Felona' and the dark melancholy of 'Sorona' serve as accurate portraits of the characters previously described. 'L'Equilibrio' and the spectacular, bombastic closure 'Ritorno al Nulla' are the closest thing to ELP that Le Orme ever created; on the other hand, 'Ritratto di un Mattino' and 'All'Infuori del Tempo' are constructed under a typically Italian-symphonic frame, creating an exhibition of sheer beauty. Not only because all tracks are linked in a continuum, but also and mostly because there is a unitary integrality functioning all throughout the repertoire, \"Felona and Sorona\" must be enjoyed as a whole. This wholeness is accomplished with a that makes this album a definitive classic in Italian prog - in Prog Archives language, this is 5-star material."

          "text": "During the Seventies Le ORME turned from a very ELP inspired band into a more refined prog rock formation with a distinctive sound. The concept-album \"Felona E Sorona\" is their acclaimed 'magnum opus' featuring nine alternating and elaborated compositions with lush and varied keyboards (piano, organ, synthesizers and string-ensemble), wonderful changing climates and a strong and dynamic rhythm-section. The final part is one of the most compelling 'grand finales' I've ever heard: slow and fat Moog runs, repetitive organ chords, a powerful drumbeat, again slow and fat Moog sounds, then a propulsive rhythm- section, culminating in a very moving sumptuous climated featuring dazzling Moog flights and great string-sounds, what a mind blowing experience, This is the amazing Italians Seventies prog rock at its best!"

          "text": "'Felona E Sorona' is pretty much flawless. I only wish there was a guitar in the mix, as their material would have benefited further from a Steve Hackett type player, but that's an obviously futile wish. Just a matter of taste. Not every prog/rock band needs a guitarist either-most of Van Der Graaf Generator's best material actually benefited from the lack of a guitar. And it's hard to hold anything against Le Orme, as this album is insanely good. This Italian trio has the same instrumental set-up as ELP: keyboards at the forefront, active bass holding down the foundation, and nimble, jazz-inflected, aggressive-yet-fluid drumming.with the bassist doing vocals. And sure enough, some of this stuff sounds like ELP's more eclectic moments on 'Tarkus' and 'Trilogy'. Otherwise, they forge a sound that bears minor similarities to Italian brethren P.F.M. and Banco.but you'll know every time you hear a Le Orme song that it's Le Orme. Delicate vocal lines, a huge array of keyboard sounds and approaches, unpredictable arrangements, shades of romantic/baroque music, crashing climactic elements, and a mastery of dramatic, theatrical songwriting.just another genius prog act from Italy!Like Banco's opening to the 'Darwin' album, Le Orme utilizes nearly every single element of their trademark approach on blowout opener \"Sospesi Nell'Incredibile\". This epic firmly lays down the atmosphere of the album, followed by two fairly short interludes before arriving at second highlight \"L'equilibrio\". A mixture of frightened panic and wide pastoral landscapes, this song is an excellent showcase of the chemistry between the three members, bass lines creating a sinister undertow, held in check by spellbinding keyboard sounds, not to mention the gorgeous vocals that lift this song up even higher. It ends too soon, but since the album flows as if one long song, the promise of \"L'equilibrio\" is concluded with the gorgeous ambience of \"Sorona\". Immediately after that, \"Attesa Inerte\" attacks with a combination psychedlic/sinister rhythmic interplay while the keyboards phase and shift and hypnotize. More cosmic journeys await on \"Ritratto Di Un Mattino\", which is yet another song in a connected, seamless string of songs that bring this album to a close. Genesis circa 'Selling England By The Pound' is loosely referenced on this track, full of triumphant melodies and piles of lush keyboards. \"All'Infuori Del Tempo\" is the most conventional song here, a gentle, folk-ish sway that gives way to a medieval feeling thanks to some well-chosen keyboard melodies from master Toni Pagliuca. The Italian language is one of the few non-English languages that was made to be sung, and bassist Aldo Tagliapietra hypnotizes with his gentle but confident midrange, showcased to good effect on this song. Things come to a satisfying finale with an orgy of keyboards and frenetic rhythms in album closer \"Ritorno Al Nulla\", a chaotic storm of cosmic beauty. All in all, 'Felona E Sorona' is a high mark in Italian progrock, probably the most consistently written and arranged album this band would ever offer."

And, I miss the guitars. I know there's two track with acoustic guitars, ('Felona\", \"All Infuori Del Tempo\") but overall, it's a fantastic keyboard fest with excellent drumming. But I still miss the coloring of the guitar. And, to make matters worse, Aldo's voice is in a flat tone practically throughout the album. I give it four stars for the super drumming and keyboards, but it misses the mark as a masterpiece because of the flatness and some dated sound. Although, if you're a keyboard fanatic, it's 5 stars."

          "text": "I had a tought choice to make when the time came to rate this album. Definitely more than a three stars, Probably more than a four, but not quite a 5. So this leads to a 4.5/5 But as the star system goes, you can only give albums full stars, and so I had to decide between afour and five stars. I felt that four stars was a better choice, as it is not perfect, but it tore my heart not to give it a five. Still, I went with the foru stars. Here is why.This album is pure Italian Prog and one of the most representative of the genre. The keyboards under all their forms are omnipresent, and as a power trio, Le Orme thrives. Of course, the ressemblance with Emerson, Lake and Palmer cannot be denied(The simple yet melodic bass, the overpowering drums and the huge variety of tone from keyboardist Toni Pagliuca), but they definitely have a sound of their own, maybe less bombastic than ELP, but a bit more melodic and even theatrical at times(it is, after all, a conceptual album).An excellent crescendo is created on the first side of the album, starting with Sospesi Nell \ufffdncredibile, a song that is highly influenced by ELP, maybe the most of the album, along of course the closer Ritorno Al Nulla but it is still excellent and creat a great feeling to the album. Than the nice acoustic felona enters, an absolutely beautiful little pastoral song. The vocals are as good as they would get on the album. This is the first problem of the album: the vocals are not always working with the music. Yet, on the 2 acoustic pieces of the album( Felona and All \ufffdnfuori Del Tempo), it works perfectly.As high as it is rated in the prog universe, you have to have high expectations when you listen to it. This is my advice: try to listen to the album for what it is than what you would want it to be. So, a great 4.5/5 for this great Italian album."

          "text": "\"No changes outside of time, two planets exist side by side. Neither aware of the other though they are intertwined like branches of a tree.\" (Peter Hammill's English adaptation).From the beginning to the end, from the form to the content, this 1973 album is really impressive! Great inventive concept about the Opposites' Theory! Le Orme imagine two planets (spheric form), Felona and Sorona, which are each the contrary of the other! The figurative representation is really catching and fascinating, quasi-ethereal with all those keyboards and mellotronic effects.also theatrical in the music's progression structure of drums and bass' parts! Many are the explanations listener often tells on this ambitious work! I think that intellectual reconstructions can be divided in two categories: philosophic one and sentimental one. In the second, always rejected as too simple, could be included all the opinions of whom think that the album is about man and woman relationship and uncommunicability! The first one theory could be divided in two further parts: reality's OBJECTIVE vision (metaphysical theory); reality's SUBJECTIVE vision (existentialist or psychological theory). These last two are not really excluding each other! The OBJECTIVE reconstruction has references with the ancient greek philosophers Parmenides and Heracletos. Parmenides was born in then greek southern Italy (in 515 B.C.) and was founder of a medicals-priests dynasty, submitted to the Apollos' cult! He thought Truth and To Be were, metaphysically, of a SPHERIC SHAPE! What's out of that SPHERE? The question is a non-sense question, for Parmenides, because saying there's Nothing, would be thinking at it as it's something!!! Heracletos was born in Ephesos (now Turkey) and teached that reality, in all its apparent motionless state and equilibrium, it's only the result of hardest and neverending conflict between the opposites!! Ying and Yang theory is the Far East's version!Sospesi Nell'Incredibile (eng. \"Suspended In The Incredible\" - Peter Hammill's adaptation: \"In Between\") is an impressive 8,40 mns long track with many shifting moods and classical influence. The lyrics introduce the listeners to that outer space worlds: \".two planets in harmony, of opposition. The supposition is that when one is serene, then the other is sad. What of the Man in between ? He smiles on one and it's life is happy. His back is turned on the other and a shadow is cast...\" (from the Peter Hammill adaptation).Felona (the first planet) is played in bells' starting happy sound and in nice acoustic guitar: \".the house - spheres are so mobile powered by the wind, they move without discomfort to the families within. Moving as the wind blows over hill and vale, bouncing through the countryside like elastic whales! And finally when evening comes and the winds die down, the spheres are left as villages and new neighbours are found... the wind creates communities tomorrow they'll be gone, but the people just make holiday and join in happy songs.\" (Peter Hammill's adaptation).La Solitudine Di Chi Protegge Il Mondo (Solitude Of Whom Protects The World - Peter Hammill changed the title in: \"The Maker\". Like the previous is a 2 mns short one, but with a soft played piano and sad vocals by Aldo Tagliapietra. The lyrics show good imagination from the band: \".it's serenity.Good makes forget who is at the origin, from whom derives. Solitude is a shadow revealing itself to all who feels himself unuseful!...\".L'Equilibrio (Equilibrium; Peter Hammill changed the title in \"Web Of Time\") is one of the best tracks, with stunning contribution from all the members! Thanks for piano and synth, Mr. Pagliuca! \".each one takes care of itself.\"; \".the soap balls disappeared. The land was scarred, no longer spherical. The houses became hard like the hearts of the men who walk the streets in despair...\" (Peter Hammill's adaptation).Sorona is one of my favourite songs.soft sad sound with the horrible description of the second unlucky planet: \".in this grey land there's place for nothing but dark marshes.rare trees by now with all the weight of Anguish.there's place for nothing but lava's rivers.bright reflections are changed into viscid scales.\".Attesa Inerte (Inert Waiting) has beautiful bass guitar from Aldo Tagliapietra (Cutstone, in eglish!): \". faces that neverending Trouble changes into masks, voices that ancient Silence makes without any noise, meet theirselves to say hello to the darkness!\"Ritratto Di Un Mattino (A Morning's Portrait) is another gem here! Warm instrumental passages, nice orchestral movements: \"happiness you'll not find in yourselves, but in all the love you'll give to everybody else.\".All'Infuori del Tempo (Outside Time): another wonderful acoustic based song with also good keyboards and angelic voice! \".but when Sorona's exulting, Felona's start its slow decline. Inexorable Night comes and Equilibrium soon finishes.\".Ritorno Al Nulla (Return To Nought) maybe the best track of the album, within the opener! Very strong, with a great chorus from all keyboards' such sounds! What an impressive conclusion to this album! \".Two perfect worlds for a moment exist. Sorona of happiness, Felona of bliss. If there is an ending, it surely comes here. Sorona in happiness, Felona in fear...But endings are circular and life is the line, it goes on for ever, no change outside time !\" (Peter Hammill's adaption).Felona and Sorona.don't kow exactly what they represent, probably we'll never know it ('till the moment we'll ask it to Aldo), but together in this album are the main characters of such a sublime music, such a deep concept prog album!!! The five stars are the natural consequence!!"

          "text": "\"Felona e Sorona\" was released in 1973 by Le Orme's \"classical\" line up featuring Aldo Tagliapietra (vocals, bass, acoustic guitar), Toni Pagliuca (keyboards, organ) and Michi Dei Rossi (drums, percussion) helped in studio by producer Gian Piero Reverberi. It's usually considered the highest point in the whole Le Orme's career and one of the best releases of the Italian prog movement in the seventies: it's absolutely magnificent and it is still regularly performed in concert (often the band plays the whole of it!). It's a concept album and it's structured as a long suite telling the story of two planets. The lyrics are very poetic and I think you have to understand their meaning to completely enjoy this work.The long and complex opener \"Sospesi nell'incredibile\" (Hanging in the incredible) sets the atmosphere. The incipit is powerful and tension immediately rises. Close your eyes and set off on an intergalactic journey, imagine another solar system where two twin planets are spinning... \"Where the sky hides behind a jewelry of a thousand stars, behind the gold dust of another universe / Two planets in harmony are spinning together in their kingdom / Where everything does not change but Time...\". Well, the twin planets are very different from each other. On the first one a perennial happiness rules while the other one is a gloomy place where you can't find anything but sorrow and hope. Their destiny is like sand running through the bulbs of an hourglass... \"Behind forests of coral, behind sighs of true lovers / Two twin roses do not die together...\". The final section of this track features an intense drum solo. Light spreads a breath of life and tears melt at the sound of bells...Tubular bells announce that you have just landed on \"Felona\", the planet of dream and happiness. The track describing this place is a lively ballad featuring a strummed 12 string guitar. A clear light slowly rises and you can see many big white bubbles. The people who live in the bubbles go everyday from party to party. There are no secrets in these transparent spheres, joy seems to be contagious, serenity rules, women and cicadas talk about love all day long. The crystal houses move carried by the wind, they run down the valleys, fly over the mountains and bounce on the sea leaving behind them trails like comets... \"At sundown the wind takes a rest / The spheres stop and form a village / People meet again and run towards each other for a new party / While the day is dying...\".\"La solitudine di chi protegge il mondo\" (The loneliness of the one who protects the world) is a short ethereal interlude featuring soaring vocals and delicate piano patterns. Happy people frequently forget to pray and to thank God for what they have. \"The good makes you forget who is at the origin, who is the maker...\". Beware! Even the maker, the one who protects the world, can feel the burden of loneliness if no one addresses to him. Well, loneliness is a dark shadow which turns out to those who feel useless...\"L'equilibrio\" (The balance) is tense track full of dark energy. There's a big void between the two planets. Felona ignores the existence of Sorona and vice-versa. The enormous abyss separates the two worlds and everyone minds his own business. The destinies of the two planets are different as well, one doesn't know the night, the other doesn't know the day... Then tension melts. The maker ends up to turn his gaze to whom is waiting for his acts to give a meaning to his life... \"The balance has its focus in time / And it will be established sooner or later / When Sorona will light up from the sky...\".\"Sorona\" describes the gloomy planet of eternal sorrow. Here you can find old cities without gardens lost into oblivion, enveloped in a thick fog as between the threads of a silkworm. Life seems trapped into the dark and even the rare plants carry the burden of anguish... \"From days gone by, lost in time / In this grey land there's no room for anything but black swamps...\".\"Attesa inerte\" (Inert waiting) is another track describing the life on the dark planet of sadness. Faces that an eternal pain has transformed in masks and voices that an ancient silence has made soundless gather together in a peculiar concert to greet the darkness as in a never ending ritual. Sorrow rules but in everyone there's faith and hope for a miracle. Helpless people rise their hands towards the sky waiting for better times, hope keeps them alive... \"A sudden light is getting closer / Now it's here!\". \"Ritratto di un mattino\" (Portrait of a morning) begins with an hypnotic keyboards pattern. Then soaring vocals and a warm organ sound show up... \"You can't find happiness in your ego / But in the love that one day you will give to the others...\". Sometimes hope and faith make dreams come true...\"All'infuori del tempo\" (Except time) starts with a joyful strummed guitar pattern. Now in the kingdom of darkness the light shines. In every body a blaze lights up and love shines all over the land. The sun rays dry a frightened fog while early leaves greet the wind. The future on Sorona is not so dark anymore! For a while the two worlds are both happy and a new life can begin. But as Sorona is still celebrating the new light, Felona begins a slow decline and darkness starts spreading on it. Soon the balance comes to an end and what is joy for Sorona is death for Felona. \"The end is a circle, the circle is the life / You have to destroy and then to build up / We are all waiting for our day / Nothing changes but time...\".The instrumental finale \"Ritorno al nulla\" is like a wild ride into the space leading to an explosion. The intergalactic journey ends here. Open your eyes and wake up now. Try to face your day with a new awareness...A very suggestive story indeed. Peter Hammill was charmed by it and wrote an interesting English version of the lyrics in 1973 (very far from literary, indeed) for an English release of the album on the label Charisma. None the less the English version, \"Felona & Sorona\", in my opinion is not at the same level of the Italian one. The music is the same since the only difference are the vocal parts sung by Aldo Tagliapietra but the singer does not seem at ease with English and the final result could appear almost clumsy..."

          "text": "Until I joined the Prog Community on Internet I believed Italian Progressive started with PFM and ended with BANCO DEL MUTUIO SOCCORSO, how wrong I was, probably the country with more Symphonic bands is Italy and one of the best is LE ORME (The Footstep) and their masterpiece is \"Felona e Sorona\" the peak of Italian conceptual albums that tells the story of two planets controlled by one same God that lives in the middle of both, almost as the center of a sand clockBoth have opposite realities, one represents the light and happiness, the other the darkness and sadness, some sort of Mediterranean version of the Ying & Yang (Aldo Taglapietra seems to be influenced by Eastern culture and is a great sitar player so I believe it's clear where the influence comes from).If most Italian bands are soft and warm with splendid melodies, LE ORME goes further, of course the melody has great importance but is much more aggressive than bands like PFM or BANCO, you can clearly perceive the influence from YES, GENESIS and ELP but also of less friendlier bands like KING CRIMSON. Not as easy to get into as the other Italian icons, but once you capture the interest is absolutely rewarding.I will try to use the real translation (Of course limited by my rudimentary Italian knowledge) of the titles not the ones used by Peter Hammill in the English version.The album starts with \"Sospesi Nell' Incredibile\" ( \"Suspended in the Incredible\"), a song that starts extremely complex and reminds me of \"Lark's Tongues in Aspic) with radical changes not only of timing but also of mood and volume, the keyboard performance by Antonio Pangliuca is outstanding, around the middle the haunting voice of Taglapietra surrounded by an atmospheric organ marks a first radical change is absolutely creepy and full of drama but that's not the only change, the song ends in a more melodic mood reminiscent of ELP with some keyboard pyrotechnics clearly inspired Keith Emerson.The second track tells the story of one of the planets \"Felona\" almost the paradise, people lives in transparent spheres that float with the wind during the night and touch ground in the day for the people to gather and celebrate because all their basic needs are provided. The music is absolutely descriptive, warm and happy almost as a feast with bells and drums, an almost Folk Medieval flute helps to get the idea better, typical example of Italian Symphonic, not as complex as the previous but important for the concept.\"La Solitudine di chi Protegge il Mondo\" (The Loneliness of He Who Protects the World\") is a very short an oneiric song with dreamy vocals surrounded by a soft piano that describes the loneliness of the maker.\"L'Equilibrio\" (The Balance) Is a track about how in certain moment the things will be balanced, Sorona was happy once, now is the turn for Felona, an excellent track, vibrant, strong again with heavy ELP influence and an excellent drumming by Michi dei Rossi but ends softer and calmed as telling us that things may and will in some moment change when God turns his face to the other side, but the secret of the balance is that none of the planet knows the existence of the other.\"Sorona\" is the story of the other planet, once happy, now sad and dark, the people have tormented faces because of the suffering and the music is simply perfect, one of the most obscure pieces of music I ever heard, almost a shout of desperation, fear and loneliness.\"Attesa Inerte\" (Inert Expectation) is a song almost in the dark vein of the previous but almost narrated instead of being sung and describes how the inhabitants of Sorona gather to pray for the miracle but without doing anything, the organ sounds almost religious to make the perfect atmosphere.\"Ritratto di un Mattino\" (Portrait of a Dawn) starts as another somber and dark track with keyboard effects and in the middle a short verse that says something like \"You can't find the happiness in yourself but in what you give to others in one morning\" and in that moment the music dramatically changes into a soft and beautiful melody with a classical Italian flavor.\"All' Infuori del Tempo\" (With the Exception of Time) starts with an acoustic guitar performance by Aldo Taglapietra that soon is joined by the keyboards and drums, describes how the things are getting better in Sorona, but to keep the balance the happiness also starts to vanish in Felona. The music describes this situation perfectly, the first part is soft and gives a sense of tranquility as things change in Sorona but the second part of the song despite it keeps the same melody has a darker mood, slower and ends completely haunting with a magnificent organ solo.\"Ritorno Al Nulla\" (Return to Zero), I guess the things are balanced for one instant in time, Sorona returning to happiness and Felona in the way to the dark fate that once had the other planet, the song is incredible, surely one of the best closers I ever heard, the band hits us with everything the have, the Baroque sound is glorious and pompous, hardly heard anything so spectacular, Symphonic Prog at it's best.I have only heard part of the English version, but please stay with the original and search for a translation, as in the case of Classical Opera, Felona E Sorona shouldn't be listened in other language than Italian, the phonetic structure is absolutely perfect.There's absolutely no problem in rating the album, 5 stars without any question."

          "text": "\"Felona E Sorona\" isn't an album for LE ORME beginners - for those trying to initiate with the band I recommend their two previous albums, much more accessible, of course. Anyway, it doesn't mean that \"Felona E Sorona\" isn't great or even tasteful - it is, but if you know the band history and backgrounds it'll sound better and much more appreciable.Here we have a typical concept album where songs/tracks work better or in their plenitude if heard along the context, I mean, when hearing the album from one point to another. It's hard to pick an individual song and play it separately - \"Felona E Sorona\" could even have no groove to divide the tracks. Also a bit astonishing is to realize that some of the most ingenious sound achievements are found within the shortest tracks herein (taking in consideration the track division provided for the album).'Sospesi nell'incredible' opens the album in a weird, astounding and sometimes thrilling approach: a cornucopia of different sounds ranging from symphonic rock to space-psych, with traces of experimental, avant-garde, jazz, folk and erudite tunes. Vocals are soft and cool like doing a kind of introduction to the tale of the two entities to be told, but counterbalanced by strong and decisive drumming and remarkable keyboard action.'Felona' is short and delicate, with its flutes and acoustic guitars, spinning totally the feelings proposed by the previous track while 'La solitudine di chi protege il mondo' brings a beautiful melodic line which is able to carry the listener to a dream in less than 2'. With 'L'equilibrio' the impacting sensation left by the opener track returns grandiosely; evidence of EL&P and YES influences isn't capable to demean the work.'Sorona' is sorrowful and poignant standing musically much like a romantic song. 'Attesa inerte' continues the balladesque melody of antecessor track but soon the atmosphere is replaced by odd sounds that catch the hearer attention. Ritratto di un matino' acts like a symphonic interlude where the nice tunes heard in 'La solitudine.' return briefly to decorate the scene. 'All'infuori del tempo' brings back the delicacy seen previously this time impregnated with more powerful arrangements but the tenderness is lost somewhere along the way making this track a bit boring. 'Ritorno al nulla', the ending track, starts with excessive synth presence very reminiscent of the EL&P features which provides a feeling of d\ufffdja vu that contributes few to the track and the album in general. Anyway, the massive and imposing final segment supplies the album with a fine last impression.\"Felona E Sorona\" is truly a great output and once one is used to LE ORME I'm quite sure that the amusement will be attained. However, when talking about rating my heart swings between the pure masterliness and the excellenceper se- this time I'll choose the last one. Total: 4 stars."

          "text": "Underwhelming and lacking substance.This is one of those occasions where my opinions go against the generally widely accepted ones of an album, Felona E Serona just feels as if it is lacking to me, it does have its share of good moments but they are few and far between. The album starts off strongly with the 8 minute Sopesi Nell'incredibile with some compelling synth and organ work but it is spoiled somewhat by the weak high-pitched vocals, the song ends well though with some appropriately 'incredibile' (couldn't resist) drum soloing. From there on things are fairly mundane with a more pop based approach plagued by poor vocals and boring acoustic guitar, 'Attese Inerte' is a definite highlight though with strong harmony and a triumphant chorus. The album ends on a fairly strong note too with the instrumental Ritorno al Nulla invoking emotion with a classically inspired dramatic approach.Felona E Sorona is decent but it is quite flawed, it lacks depth, the vocals are weak and it departs a little too often from the symphonic prog parts into pop territory plus it is a mere 33 minutes long. Recommended only to fans of Italian Symphonic Prog."

          "text": "Le Orme released a succulent album a year prior this one. Uomo Di Pezza surely belongs to their best work ever writtenI feel that this one lacks some of the grandiose vocal harmonies, poignant songs of its predecessor. This is also a very much less ELP oriented album (actually it is not). Of course, I'm missing some more guitar work (but I felt exactly the same during Uomo.).There are really too many short songs on this album. Not the ideal format to develop powerful ideas and to demonstrate how great a prog songwriter you are. But this cost already the five star rating toUomo..There are no weak song featured on this album, but I am lacking the brilliance, the extremely melodic feeling, the excellence of Uomo. It was of course difficult to do better.Felona & Sorona is a good album but I am somewhat disappointed with this work.I know that comparison is no reason, but I really believe that Aldo Tagliapietra was much more lyrical, passionate and truly phenomenal during their previous album. He added so much feeling to this work. In this release, he is good. No shivering track, not that same emotion that could be felt on Uomo.Of course there are some great moments on this album (the finale of Ritratto Di Un Mattino for instance. But so short...There are no highlights as such IMHHO on this album. Just a sum of good track. Iam not very sensible to the concept that is supposed to drive this effort either.Three stars for this good album."

          "text": "It may take you a while (as it did me), or it may be instantaneous, but eventually you'll come to appreciate this fine album from Le Orme. As the black-white contrast on the cover hints, there are impressive contrasts in moods, from happy, major-chord-dominated songs, to spacey and menacing bits. This album still has that cute, unmistakable charm of Italian symphonic prog, but some of the happier parts seem quite folksy to me (similar to Harmonium perhaps). Either way, Felona e Sorona is a fine album.The highlights: Sospesi Nell 'Incredible, L'equilibrio, Ritorno al Nulla. These songs are the faster and heavier songs on the album, and Sospesi and Ritorno open and close the album, respectively. Based on my limited exposure to Le Orme, they apparently know how to put their best material in the most important places. Sospesi opens with classic prog playfulness and countermelodies, and then merges into a grandiose chorus, and finishes with an excellent spacey freak-out. L'equilibrio may be the highlight of the album for me, particularly the inspired, 5/4 piano bridge. Closing out the album on a high, Ritorno cranks up the intensity with a key and synth-dominated, menacing build. If the whole album was equal in quality to these three tracks, it would be a five-star in my book any day.The rest. I must emphasize that there are no bad songs on this album, as you might expect. These songs are generally simpler, and to my ears largely less interesting, than the others. For those whom the charming aspect of Le Orme is a highlight, then you will be very pleased. Of course, even I have to acknowledge the remaining brilliance of this album, including the irresistibly catchy Felona and the gorgeous climax of Rittrato di un Mattino.In short, I prefer music with a little more bite than much of this album offers, but objectively I certainly appreciate the beauty of this album in its entirety. I certainly don't mind that it's relatively short: if it's consistently good and coherent, then it's much better by me than an album packed with filler. Although I would not consider these guys to be virtuosos, they have created an alternatingly beautiful and eerie album that really works."

          "text": "Continuing with my exploration in the world of RPI, the turn has now come the second of its three giants, namely Le Orme. Blinded by the light that PFM turned out to be, I was eagerly anticipating more Italian prog, and in retrospect I might have expected just a little to much. At first I actually found Felona E Sorona hugely disappointing, and I constantly lost attention during the first listens.But with so many glowing reviews and recommendations, you're always left with this feeling that you must be mistaken, that the rest of the world stands laughing at your ignorance, leaving you confused and frustrated wondering what's wrong. So luckily, I gave it more time. And that changed, if not all, at least a great deal of my opinions considering the album.Le Orme plays a very keyboard-oriented kind of prog and just as with ELP, the occasional guitar is more an exception than a rule. But the sharp angularity that often riddles the works of Keith Emerson is transformed into a more mellow, melodic and melancholic form by Le Orme. Being a mixture of darker and lighter songs, it still is the melancholia that stands out. Compared to PFM's Per Un Amico, this is a very, very gloomy album, almost disturbing at times. Lonely. This is something the band achieves with great skill and success, making use of all you can get from the keys at that time. Pompous, soaring organ for atmosphere and texture, intricate melodies, classically arranged piano and spaced-out effects form the basis, or rather, IS Felona E Sorona. Even the sometimes flamboyant, skillfull and heavy drumming of Michi Dei Rossi or the times when Aldo Tagliapietra's bass enters from its place somewhere down in the massive keys' undergrowth can't prevent that.When listening to the album you realise that there are very few highlights among the nine songs. And since this equals consistency and sticking to the concept of the album it is in some way a good characteristic. But it's just the same thing that, together with the clear, smooth voice of Aldo's that make the album very concentrated and hard to grasp. It seldom rises from the mellow mid-tempo, songs lack clear hooks and crescendos and it just gets a little blurry after a while. Aldo never reaches emotional peaks, his phrasing remains innocent, emotional and sad, even though he's got a fantastic voice I immediately accepted and praised. It's no wonder then that my two stand-out tracks are the opening and the closer, Sospesi Nell \ufffdncredibile and Ritorno Al Nulla respectively. Because these tracks are the ones that adds some true dynamics to the album, with some much desired action and surprising changes. The latter of the two is one of the most stunning album finals I've heard so far, which says a lot. Ending with an unrivaled feeling of feverish uncertainty.Just as with PFM's L'Isola Di Niente I feel some amount of irritation and slight disappointment after hearing Felona E Sorona. Perhaps with more time and in the right mood I'll learn to appreciate it fully, but as it is right now, it doesn't stand out as a masterpiece. 3,5 stars, going for 3.//LinusW"

          "text": "This is probably Le Orme\ufffds most prestigious record ever. And rightly so. It took me a long time to get this album, although it was very popular among progheads in Brazil during the 70\ufffds. Even though I share with Sean Trane a certain dislike for this kind of trio (Keyboards - bass - drums), Le Orme\ufffds work is so powerful I always had to make an exception (along with Triunvirat).Le Orme\ufffds greatness lies basicly in the fact that the band has a unique chemistry: band members are extremely skillful, but the sum is bigger than its parts. And the songwriting is the focal point: far from just fooling around showing off their technique, they are much more concerned in producing fine music together. Besides, the group also have in Aldo Tagliapietra a stunning singer, which makes all the difference from many other trios.The Music in Felona E Sorona is not as accessible as their earlier work, it takes some time to get used to, but once you get it, you\ufffdre hooked. The melodies are memorable, it\ufffds a labor of love and inspiration. The arrangements are great and the band\ufffds sound is very tight. It\ufffds really hard to believe it\ufffds only 3 guys playing. It may be a little short for today\ufffds standard (only 33:39), but what a beautiful short piece of music! The quality is absolutely top notch. The right production also helps a lot.One of the best releases of the 70\ufffds, no less. It helped stabilish Italy as one of the best sources of prog music in the world. Even today Felona E Sorona stands as a major piece of world\ufffds prog rock. A classic album that anyone interested in symphonic prog music (italian or otherwise) should have."

          "text": "Colliding universes, the realities of a life that has conflicting emotions where the fine, fine line between pleasure and pain seem to keep the blood flowing, forever on the verge of falling down the endless abyss. Alter egos, yin and yang, polar opposites and Murphy's Law, it's all about the simple complexities that can be found when art imitates life. Le Orme really soared to celestial heights when putting this concept masterstroke together, deliberately choosing the epic battle between light and dark. \"Felona e Sorona\" are two planets at extreme ends of the universe and can be a metaphor for a vast quantity of players, from man and woman to good and evil. The musical tone can also go from somber and aggressive symphonics to sweet and pastoral quasi-Italian folk music, befitting the story of the never-ending feud. Few records anywhere will initiate such a rush as the first notes of \"Sospesi nell'Incredibile\", a spooky and dense sonic holocaust with Toni Pagliuca's devastating organ and synthesizer, initially with a similar feel to Ange's Le Cimetiere des Arlequins, Aldo Tagliapietra poking massive bass markers and the savage drum assault by the \"Bonhamesque\" Miki Dei Rossi. When Aldo introduces his instantly recognizable voice, the piece luxuriates in such a groove, that it's hard not to swoon in delight, his reptilian bass slurping malevolently as the synth whistles in frenzy. There is a slight ELP hint which should come as no surprise but the pastoral contrasts take this into another galaxy, as \"Felona\" sounds more like a \"canzione\", a brisk, joyously limpid ballad that elicits a sense of \"insouciance\". \"La Solitudine.\" is a brief piano propelled interlude, with Aldo's voice ascending to a higher plane introducing the shimmering \"L'Equilibrio\" with slashing organ blasts, bubbling bass, dancing synths and incensed drumming , all conspiring with the rollicking jazzy piano. \"Sorona\", the reverse mood to the bucolic \"Felona\" is created by proposing a somber dirge, with Tagliapietra's beseeching vocals evoking a sense of despair and harrowing melancholia. \"Attesa Inerte\" gradually returns to more overt symphonics, the elastic bass whooping sardonically and the buzz of the synth jousting with the strident organ. \"Ritratto di Un Mattino\" has a more pious feel to it, with a grandiose theme adorned with some electric guitar, piano and tubular bells. The gentle touch of \"All'Infuori del Tempo\" suggests a simpler almost medieval melody, acoustic guitar and flute-toned organ endowing the theme with a halo of peace. \"Rottorno alla Nulla\" is exactly that, the hypnotizing loop is complete, the full orbit is done, back into the clashing synths and the thrashing cymbals universe of the two planets at opposing ends of the spectrum. A short blazing supernova and a necessary monument in the ISP landscape. 4.5 moons"

          "text": "While the cover art has you expecting some stimulating music, you will find that such is not the case with Le Orme's masterpiece, Felona e Sorona. While the band possess a charming Italian sound with a plesant vocalist, their work lacks some musical depth. Ideas tend to be underdeveloped and instrumentals tend to be foregettable. One glaring exception is \"L'Equilibrio,\" which in a mere 3 and 3- quarter minutes flows from a rockin' synth lead with impassioned vocals to another rockin' synth lead backed by a solid tom beat which unexpectedly moves into jazzy instrumental section and out into a melodic and climactic ending. It's hard not to sample that track and not buy the record (such was my mistake).The band does have a nice balance to their sound. They have heavier passages among passages that approach pop territory, and it all feels natural. They have some good hooks, and the opening number gives them a lot of room to strut their stuff, which indeed they have. The problem is the album lacks development. All of the songs seem to end without closure, or without really expanding on any good ideas the band presented, and next thing you know you're on to the next song. However, while they may have stuff to strut, that opening number is actually overlong. It's almost 5 minutes longer than the next longest song on the record, but that time difference is mostly due to a large jam section in the second half. It has a couple of cool basslines, but the solos are unfortunately forgettable. To make matters worse, the production is semi-fuzzy and devoid of any punch.Fans of the Italian prog rock sound will be swept up at the start of this one, but a closer look at this album will reveal incompletions, though it may not bother some. Obviously a multitude of prog fans love this disc, but for those not as easily taken with the Italian symphonic sound, ownership of the album may result in a dusty case and a pristine disc."

And so we get a lavish array of synths on this one.\"Sospesi Nell'Incredibile\" is a song that cannot be propery described because of how moving and uplifting it is. It opens with a very impressive drum / organ passage before that section stops 2 minutes in and then those gorgeous vocals of Aldo come in with waves of organ. Gulp. Stronger vocals 4 minutes in are followed by some great drumming and synth work. This is truly amazing ! The drumming is just so impressive. It gets spacey after 7 minutes. \"Felona\" features strummed guitar with vocals.This is fun and light until the fuzz organ arrives a minute in. Flute late. \"La Solitudine Di Chi Protegge Il Mondo\" is spacey with distant sounding vocals to open. Aldo then sings beautifully as piano joins him. It's spacey again to end it.\"L'Equilibrio\" features organ, synths, vocals, piano and drums that all come and go making this song a great and interesting ride. \"Sorona\" is a 2 1/2 minute song that features mournful vocals with synths and gentle guitar. \"Attesa Inerte\" opens with orchestral-like sounds before string-synths come in with vocals a minute in. I love when the beat comes in before 1 1/2 minutes. Organ 2 minutes in. This is such a cool track. Themes are repeated. \"Ritratto Di Un Mattino\" is spacey to start with. Vocals join in around 1 1/2 minutes. A gorgeous melody comes in before 2 minutes. This is so uplifting. It settles right down with piano 3 minutes in to end it. \"All'Infuori Del Tempo\" opens with strummed guitar as reserved vocals join in. Organ comes and goes. Drums and a fuller sound after 3 minutes. It's spacey to end it. \"Ritorno Al Nulla\" is the closing instrumental. Synths and drums dominate in impressive fashion.I do prefer \"Uomo Di Pezza\" (I think) but both are masterpieces in my opinion."

          "text": "This is a masterpiece Italian progressive rock album by Le Orme (one of three progressive acts from Italy with other acts were Banco & PFM). The music is original in style even though there are styles that remind me to bands like The Nice, ELP, Refugee, Genesis and Yes. The key elements of the composition comprising keyboard as major act while bass guitar is also quite dominant, followed with drums. They wrote the music with tight composition, dynamic time signatures, quite complex yet the melody has been maintained catchy and there are heavy influences of classical music.Melodic Symphonic Prog, in Dark Mood ..The album opener, \"Sospesi Nell \ufffdncredibile (In between)\" (8:43), is an inspiring and challenging to observe. It starts with ambient yet energetic organ work in symphonic style reminiscent of ELP or the Nice or Refugee followed with drumming in dynamic way plus bass guitar work. The first 2 minutes plus, the music deals with acrobatic nature of organ work until at approx minute 2:25 when the vocal enters in dark mood. The organ follows the music at background. In the middle of the track there is stunning organ work augmented by tight bass lines .and later, the drumming enters dynamically and combined together they make great progressive sound. It's one of my favorite tracks.\"Felona\" (1:58) is basically an acoustic guitar, accompanying vocal, while the next track \"La Solitudine Di Chi Protegge Il Mondo (The maker)\" (1:57) which has catchy melody demonstrated by vocal, backed up beautifully by piano touches in classical music style. The organ solo at the end of the track is really a great embarkation point to higher energy track \"L'Equilbrio (Web of time)\" (3:47) which flows brilliantly at the end of previous track, seamlessly. This is another great composition as the music style changes from one segment to another. The keyboard work at approx minute 0:38 demonstrates symphonic nature of the song. And the bass guitar plays dynamically here. The keyboard work at minutes 1:22 is quite similar with Genesis \"The Fountain of Salmacis\". Influenced? It might be . as \"The Fountain of Salmacis\" is from \"Nursery Cryme\" album released in 1971. But overall, this track is superb!\"Sorona\" (2:28) is a very melodic and nice song in acoustic version, no drumming, with dark mood. I like the way how simple keyboard work augmented by simple guitar fills provides great foundation for \"melodic\" vocal to enter the music. It's so sad in nuance, dark, but it's truly a nice melodic vocal line. Especially, because it's said in Italian language and I think Italian is the best language for progressive music. It's better than English, really. Just compare this track with ELP's \"The Sage\". I think you will honestly say that \"Sorona\" is much better. Don't believe with me? Try it now!\"Sorona\" flows wonderfully to next track \"Attesa Inerte (The plan)\" (3:25) which starts ambient with great symphonic multi-layered keyboard sound augmented by nice bass guitar work. At 0:48 the music changes the style and .. oh my God! The vocal line enters brilliantly here, in similar vein like \"Sorona\". Again, the use of Italian language has made the song sounds so solid. The music turns to ELP-like with its keyboard-driven work. The song moves seamlessly to \"Ritratto Di Un Mattino (The Balance)\" (3:29) which the first half is an acoustic keyboard work and the later half comprises drums and other instruments.\"All \ufffdnfuori Del Tempo (Return to naught)\" (4:08) sounds like different style than the previous tracks even though still in the corridor of Italian typical prog. It uses acoustic guitar and vocal in straight forward composition. Full music only appears at the end of the track. The album concludes with \"Ritorno Al Nulla\" (3:34) through the sound of long sustain keyboard followed with brilliant organ work and drumming that reminds me to The Nice or Refugee. This last track is a nice instrumental.Overall, what can I say about this masterpiece work with killing melody in almost all individual track? Considering the year of release, you might compare this album with Genesis \"Selling England By The Pound\" or ELP \"Brain Salad Surgery\" and this album is at par excellent with those two legendary albums. I consider the music of this album is a melodic symphonic prog with dark mood.Keep on proggin' ..!Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW (i-Rock! Music Community)"

          "text": "A masterful composition of mood and colorReview #600 should be marked by something special. We finally arrive at the pinnacle of the Orme brand, or so we've been told. I admit to being in a state of great anticipation over this album after reading the reviews and soaking up the wonderful album cover, wonderful not because of the nudity but because the style is so European. I love the profile view of the face at the right side of the cover which reminds me of an old Antonioni film.... \"L'Avventura\" anyone?While their previous album was a huge advancement over \"Collage\" this album does not make the same grand leap in quality or technique over \"Pezza\", but it does make changes in mood and composition. You still have the dependable and formidable Orme attributes: the warm and melancholic vocals, the comforting bass presence, the keys over guitar paradigm, and the crisp and fluent drumming. But here some of the arbitrary bombast and obvious melody of the previous album is replaced by a murkier, artier, more esoteric listening experience.As Linus brilliantly noted this music is\"lonely\" and also distant.....detached somehow. Yet it remains full of the substantive intricacies that make Orme so appealing.Tommy Sch\ufffdnenberg from VintageProg.com calls this one\"their most original-sounding album, as Pagliuca now had taken full advantage of the synths (both Moog and string-synths) and made them one of the most important features in the sound of the record. Even many of the organ-chords had been layered with the synths, often making it hard to distinguish the two keyboards apart from each other, resulting in a very unique sound.\"I am mystified at reading several reviews that suggest \"Felona\" has no highlights to be found, as I hear them in every track. The entire work suggests the highlight of a career, and to date I've not been more impressed by an album from the \"Big 3\" of Italian prog (although there are still some Banco titles I need to hear.) You will also read that this album is an ELP clone and while there are stylistic similarities, Orme succeeds by focusing on mood and detail over fireworks. I've never been moved by ELP melodies to the extent I've been here.For me this is the best Orme title I've heard thus far, very close to a masterpiece by any measure. Whereas \"Uomo di Pezza\" seemed a more benevolent face for Orme, at turns nostalgic and beautiful, \"Felona e Sorona\" gets under your skin in a less comfortable but more seductive way. I'll agree this one takes longer to fully assimilate, but once your brain begins to dissect the layers here you will never lose your appreciation of this music. Layered and intelligent, nearly perfected arranged, and flawlessly constructed songwriting. Much more than the previous two albums, here every note from the first track seems destined and engrossing.I believe Orme learned much from the experience of the prior albums and were able to combine that experience with what was still a firm commitment to the majestic and flowery progressive epics of the moment. They had not yet switched gears in musical thought and the result is that \"Felona\" is the album where it all came together for this band. Listen to the way Aldo's bass takes over as lead in the mid-late sections of \"Sospesi Nell 'Incredible\" or the way they can drop gears from that ferocious opener right back into a folksy, light acoustic number like \"Felona\" without missing a beat.Both \"kinds\" of tracks are equally and lovingly adorned with much care around the edges, delicate piano twinkling, bells, the crispness of the strummed acoustic, the floating mellotron. The perfect transitions of tension and release, such as from \"La Solitudine\" to \"L'Equilbrio\", and the achingly beautiful melodies throughout are so impressive to me. The quiet guitar, the spooky drapery of melancholy that opens \"Sorona\" on side two will stop you in your tracks, makes you close your eyes and listen. The heavenly melodic conclusion of \"Ritratto di un Mattino\" has to be among prog's most beautiful moments---if it doesn't move you, your heart must be offline.Another perfectly ascending, long transition follows from \"All 'Infuori\" into the final track which is the most extroverted of the set, a true finale! The scant 33 minute running length is often decried by people as a negative; in fact, it is never the quantity but rather the quality that we should focus on. \"Felona\" plays very much like one continuous suite and the length is more or less perfect to me. It also has aged very well and sounds positively fresh. While many bands have claimed on Orme influence over the years, none get close to capturing the balance of factors that made the original so great.\"Felona\" in some ways is more modest and less grandiose, less \"over the top\" than the period giants like Topographic or The Lamb. And yet it is every bit the masterpiece because it is so perfectly adorned in its moods, composition, and superb performance. It is not the prog-rock album for those looking for excitement and guitar thrills, of that much I will give its critics. It is one for fans who prefer a more thoughtful, subdued, yet enormously fulfilling experience. It's almost a cinematic experience, like the musical equivalent of 60s European modernist film. A must for RPI fans and essential for any well-rounded collection."

Perfect melodies ( as usual for Italian prog), very soft and warm sound, enough complex technique.So, we have here one more synth/keyb driven trio, but in italian manner. Not pompastic with heavy drive as ELP, but more dreamy and well-rounded, as early Genesis. The vocal is strong enough, as well as rhythm section. I think that main problem with their music is absent of guitar sound on record. So, dominated synth-sound ( with competent bass/drums support) makes music a bit liquid, in some moments remain even new age nightmares.Overall, the album is strong enough. Not masterpiece ( because of too high viscosity), but really pleasant. Happily, having enough sympho elements, didn't become baroque piece played by rock-band. It's important!"

Le Orme is quite different band, than it's italian fellows - PFM, BMS and others. Especially their fourth album - Felona e Sorona doesn't contains typical symphonic style of most f the italian bands and albums. And this different and uncommon style of Le Orme makes them highly interesting and attracting band. Felona e Sorona is very well structured album with perfect expressiveness collected in only 33 minutes. It tells about two planets with totally different mood and existence. It could be felt everywhere in the first and second part of the album. The sound is highly keyboards-saturated with mainly synthesizers in there. As a tradition for italians, drumming style is from outer space. Highly recommended album for space and crossover fans. Treasure of irregular prog sound from this latitudes. 4.5 starsItalian genuine piece of progressive rock"

          "text": "The best progressive music acknowledges the dark and light sides of humanity and of our existence on this earth and beyond. In that sense works like \"The Wall\" and \"Tales From Topographic Oceans\", as significant as they may be, are flawed in their consistent pessimism and optimism respectively, and LE ORME's oft regarded pinnacle represents the archetypal expression of life's perennial dichotomies. This is a tale of two planets, one radiant and the other eternally bitter, so far apart in space. The story itself may hardly be headline news, but the music herein and the manner in which it communicates the schism certainly are.While the individual track lengths are mostly modest, each leads into the next such that \"Felona and Serona\" flows like a suite, or two suites, the first 4 tracks more or less depicting Felona and the last 5 Serona. The black cloud over the better of these 2 (Felona) is that it was reprised even more potently in 1997 at LE ORME's Progday appearance, so I only ever listen to it in that rendition. But the silver lining is that the original studio version still eclipses 99% of what was and is out there for sheer clarity of musical vision, not to mention rapturous vocals conveying scintillating melodies and keyboard, bass and percussive histrionics to draw the emotional well up within any red blooded symphonic progger. The 9 minute opening segment and the epilogue \"L'Equilbrio\" are the best of the best.On the flipside, the music is more maudlin and subdued, appropriately so, but just doesn't plumb the depths one would wish to contrast with the heights of part 1. The \"Serona\" part is reflective and profoundly sad but doesn't draw one in enough. However, the acoustic oriented \"All'infuori del tempo\" and the organ and moog frenzy of \"Ritorno al nulla\" do come close to, and in some aspects surpass what we experienced on Felona.LE ORME demonstrates in barely 33 minutes how the sweet loving lady and her dreary self obsessed twin each need the better part of each other for completeness, which is all but achieved in this landmark effort."

          "text": "Produced with the woolliest sound you could possibly obtain that far from Canterbury,Felona E Soronamanages to surpass the level of excellence that Le Orme had achieved onUomo Di Pezza. The warm sad sound of this album gripped me from the first time I heard it and has only continued to grow over the many regular listens I gave it.In just a bit over 33 minutes and 9 unique pieces of music, Le Orme builds a strong case that prog can rock without any guitars or other harsh sounds. Instead, they do it with smooth, melodious keyboard-driven compositions. The secret sits in the solid rhythm section that sustains their dark-romantic sound. Both the drums and the bass guitar are delicious throughout. The instrumentation is kept quite sparse at times, such as in the second half of the opening track. It makes the organ and mellotron heavy outbursts all the more powerful.Apart from the lengthy opening track, the songs are very short, but they make up a nice suite that offers plenty of variation and still makes for one fluent listening experience. There are a number of tunes that flirt with how much mellowness and sentiment I can handle on an album. It makes me regret again I haven't got to know this music earlier when I wouldn't have minded the woolly sound and could have appreciated as much as my favourite classic Prog albums.Le Orme deliver very convincing proof that a focused 33 minutes of constant excellent quality is so much more satisfying then any 60 minute album of which only half of the material is good. Of course 33 minutes of this continuous quality are passed before you realize it. The solution to this issue? Put it on instant repeat or continue with another vintage Le Orme album. You won't be disappointed."

          "text": "It's a close call as to whether I preffer Felona E Sorona or previous release Uomo Di Pezza as my favourite Le Orme album, but perhaps this does have the edge. The question is perhaps of little importance as both capture one of the finest Italian prog bands at their best.At this time Le Orme were a three piece (they would expand to four in the mid-nineties) with a Keyboard, bass and drums line up with occasional guitar. One look at the year of release (1973) and it will not surprise vintage keyboard lovers they're in for a treat.Felona E Sorona is a concept album based on a story of two planets, one flourishes, one doesn't and down to my ignorance of the Italian language I'm afraid that's all you're going to get on the lyrical themes. Musically the album is sophisticated symphonic prog. Whilst not the most bombastic of bands, there are nevertheless powerful moments but where Le Orme really score is in the strength and beauty of their melodies, aided by the vocal delivery of Aldo Tagliapietra who's melancholic tones are perfect for job. Felona E Sorona is an album best digested as a whole, whether you can understand the concept or not as the music flows from one track to the next, ranging from the longer opener Sospesi Nell'incredibile (In Between) with some fine instrumental work between vocal sections to shorter interludes like the acoustic guitar led Felona. A little more off the wall is the wailing siren effect that underlies Attesa Inerte (The Plan). However, it's the more melodic sounding moments, littered all over this album that really hit the spot. They save their most bombastic moment for the grand finale that is Ritorno al Nulla, a fine way to close for sure as it builds to powerful climax.It's difficult to find fault with this masterpiece of Italian prog; while the musicianship is always of a high standard, it's always sympathetic to the requirements of the song, band members never overplaying for the sake of it making it a very mature recording. Hardly surprising, there's some fine keyboard playing from Toni Pagliuca in particular with use of piano, synths and organ overlaying the dextrous rhythm work of drummer Michi Dei Rossi and Tagliapietra's bass.If you were to only ever buy ten RPI albums then Felona E Sorona would easily make that list of essential purchases and due the accessible and melodious nature of the material makes an excellent early entry in discovering the fascinating genre of Italian progressive rock."

          "text": "\"Felona E Serona\" by Le Orme is an infamous RPI album that has so much to offer it is impossible to ignore for serious progheads.I was introduced to the band by those melodic keyboard strains at the beginning of Sospesi nell incredible. And what an introduction it was, such an ambient uplifting sound. The vocals are pleasant sounding and clear and Italian so I do not know the lyrics but it is positive in tone with an enriching atmosphere throughout. I was reminded of PFM or Banco del Mutuo Soccorso but Le Orme still are original in their own right. The basslines are incredible and the lengthy pads on keyboard sound similar to Rick Wakeman from Yes at times. There is a wonderful lengthy instrumental with keyboard effects with a futuristic feel, even space rock in one section. I love when there is just a bass, keys and drums, the band are really in full flight in these passages. The music seems to transport you to another place, like all good prog, and there is even an accomplished drum solo in this opening track.The clanging bells herald the arrival of Felona and an acoustic guitar. The melody is quirky and accessible, almost like a pop track. 'Nothing really matters except to be alive and that is taken care of by the symbol of the sky'... uplifting, as I said. Although this is not as wildly experimental as the previous track, I like this a lot. There is a lilting flute at the end of this too.La solitudine di che protegge is very melancholic and serene, with twinkling piano flourishes and soft Italian vocals. Each track is so diverse and unique it really is quite a journey that Le Orme takes the listener on.L'equilibrio is a quiet ambient piece that capitalises on the keyboard pads and high falsetto singing.Sorona begins very slowly with very atmospheric music and falsetto singing. It is a short piece that works as a transition between tracks and leads to the next. Attese inerte has a very intriguing bass line and begins with pads then builds to a strange ascending synth line. This feels a lot darker than the previous tracks particularly due to the droning synth motif. An agreeable Hammond sound ensues over the ascending drones. The vocals continue in time to the rhythms. A high pitched whine sounds creepy but works well and we have a passage with all these elements working against each other that somehow gels together.Ritratto di un mattino begins with an ethereal keyboard sound that builds like a stalker creeping on its prey. The album seems to have become darker as it progresses. The clear echo vocals are very estranged over the long keyboard pads. A slow melody phrase locks in and very nice guitar work is the feature.The next track, All infuori del tempo, is a return to master class performance with a strong acoustic rhythm. The vocals are melodic and there are some eclectic time sig changes. The minimalist approach of chords on a guitar and impressive vocal performance hold the track together, but it launches into passages of keyboard brilliance and erratic drumming. The closing track Ritorno al nulla is majestic and instrumental based. There are some incredible keyboard passages on this that lift it into the stratosphere. Of particular note is the repetitive motif that rises and falls throughout; it enters into a new level for Le Orme as one of the best instrumentals you will hear.As musical virtuosos they were unsurpassed in their time. The drumming is frenetic at times, and then it all ends on one long note. A wonderful track and an incredible album that you should hear at your nearest convenience. 4 solid stars."

The occasion calls for an unavailing of another one of my all time favorite albums. This one is a bit different but in order to figure out the details you'll just have to keep on reading my400th review!After being pleasantly surprised by the 1972 releaseUomo Di Pezzazit was only natural for me to follow it up by the 1973 successor titledFelona E Sorona. Unfortunately it took a lot longer to get my hands on this album but ever since March 2010 I've been playing it like crazy. According to the play count on my MP3 player I've played the opening trackSospesi Nell \ufffdncredibile49 times so far and it definitely deserves the attention that I've given it. Spanning for almost 9 minutes, the opening track takes up almost a third of this album's space and it's a gorgeous ride from beginning to the end. Just like the predecessor,Felona E Soronaopens with a lengthy instrumental section followed by a vocal introduction. Although this time it's almost like if the opening ofUomo Di Pezzazwas fused together with the album's concluding instrumentalAlienazionebut with even more power to it.The album marks the first time when I really appreciated a concept album without actually comprehending a single uttered word. After trying to translate the lyrics from Italian I soon gave up this attempt realizing that the album's strength was primarily in the composition work and not the themes. This album is much darker and experimental in its tone than anything else that I've experience by Le Orme. I don't know if this has to do with the period that the band was undergoing or if this mainly has to do with the album's theme but it really creates an entirely different aura surrounding the release. To me it basically sounds like a soft and beautiful Rock Progressivo Italiano release but with a lot more mystery to it.After the lengthy first track that felt like pure bliss, the album gets even better with the dramaticL'Equilbriofollowed by the sad balladSorona. Still it's the album's final act that completely steals the show for me, most notably with the excellent keyboard effects onAttesa Inerteand the melodic guitar solo onRitratto Di Un Mattinowhich might even make Slash feel jealous! The concluding sections gives us another great instrumental outro, which at times sounds like Steve Hackett'sPlease Don\ufffdt Touch, completing the album's short cycle on a high note that makes us want to hearFelona E Soronatime and time again!This is a gorgeous piece of Symphonic Prog that you'll want to have in your collection in order to give it quick half hour spins which will ultimately result in hours upon hours of indulgence. This is a quality that I definitely don't take for granted and award it the highest possible recommendations on my part. Simply a must-have album for all fans of progressive rock music!***** star songs: Sospesi Nell \ufffdncredibile (8:43) L'Equilbrio (3:47) Sorona (2:28) Attesa Inerte (3:25) Ritratto Di Un Mattino (3:29)**** star songs: Felona (1:58) La Solitudine Di Chi Protegge Il Mondo (1:57) All \ufffdnfuori Del Tempo (4:08) Ritorno Al Nulla (3:34)"

          "text": "Heralded as one of the major Italian progressive rock albums but actually rather limited when compared to PFM's gorgeous 'Per Un Amico' or Maxophone's brilliant self-titled debut, 'Felona E Sorona' is an impressively-played but fundamentally flawed concept piece which starts strongly but never regains the momentum of it's imperious opening track. Featuring an almost funky, rumbling bass, stabbing keyboards and a haunting synth melody, 'Sospesi Nell'incredible' is a truly remarkable beginning that belies Le Orme's indebtedness to King Crimson and Van Der Graaf Generator. From then on, however, the album seems to lose focus; none of the following eight tracks set the pulse racing, and it is only the epic album- closer 'Ritorna Al Nulla' that generates any excitement as the frenzied organ combines darkly with yet more thuddering bass-lines and classically-influenced piano to create a suitably epic ending. Fans looking for the real Le Orme experience will do well to seek out the excellent double-live album 'Live Orme' instead, a release that shows just what an inventive, eclectic and hard-rocking outfit they could be. 'Felona E Sorona' demonstrates the group's penchant for complex harmonics and ambitious themes, but it doesn't fully showcase Le Orme at their very best. Both Interesting and worthy then, but this is by no means the pinnacle of Italian prog. STEFAN TURNER, LONDON, 2010"

          "text": "The fourth album from Le Orme is both the group's most popular and their greatest. This is one of those rare occasions where I agree that a certain artists' most well loved album is also their best. Some people refer to these guys as an Italian ELP, which is neither accurate nor fair. Being a trio of keyboards/bass/drums, they do sometimes sound similar to other trios with that line-up. Besides this album, I have only heard the previous album and the one after this; both are good, but not as good as this. The synths sometimes sound like they are polyphonic. 1973 seems too early for the use of them, but since there is only three members maybe the synth parts were heavily overdubbed.I don't speak Italian, so I'm not sure if there is a story to the album or not. Anyway, the first song is \"Sospesi nell'Incredible\". This has a nice buildup at the beginning. I like the overdubbed keyboards you hear all over around a minute in. Music changes a bit. Later on some organ and then vocals. Like the groove they go into halfway, the drumming is great here. Love the synth that comes in towards the end. Spacey. Ends with a mini drum solo. \"Felona\" is a short folky/poppy song. Nice but nothing special. I love the synth here though, even if it's only for just a few seconds.\"La Solitudine di chi Protegge il Mondo\" is another short song. Basically classical piano and vocals. \"L'equilibrio\" gets back to the symph prog. Great keyboard playing here. Love the jazzy section they go into halfway. \"Sorona\" has a cool tremoloed bass sound. Basically a ballad with mostly vocals and keyboards. \"Attesa Inerte\" is a highlight. It really sounds like polyphonic string-synths at the start. I love the repeated synth drone which sounds like an engine revving up. Then an almost disco beat comes in. This sounds close to techno, very ahead of it's time. The other parts that contrast with this section are great too.\"Ritratto di un Mattino\" starts with some cool horror film sounding keyboards. Then gets more anthemic and symphonic with vocals. The whole band joins in for some symphonic rock. \"All'infuori del tempo\" is another poppy folk song. Nice mix of organ and synth. The beginning of \"Attesa Inerte\" is reprised at the end. \"Ritorno al Nulla\" is an instrumental. Starts with a great buildup and later some Moog soloing. I wish these guys were 100% instrumental.A classic RPI album from this trio. I really like the instrumental parts, but I'm not so big on most of the parts with singing. This would be a 5 star album to me if every song was as good as \"Sospesi\" and \"Attesa\". Highly recommended to those just starting their journey into RPI. A great album and good addition to your collection. 4 stars."

Aldo Tagliapietra's vocals sound sterile and emasculated.On the plus side - the instrumentation is pretty good with plenty of space between players. They also sound far larger than a three piece band. The tunes themselves are pretty standard fare for the early 70's and are nothing to get excited about. In fact, it's really all quite forgettable by the time you reach the end of this album.There are one or two adventurous passages in \"Felona E Sorona\" in the form of Toni Pagliuca's keyboards - but you'll forget what they sounded like as soon as the record ends. It really is one of those albums you've heard so much about, want to like, but basically goes in one ear and out the other.A dull listen but a well recorded album that understandably has an army of followers. It just doesn't cut the mustard for me at all. I find it really dull..."

Though it is a great little album, I don't quite consider it a full-on masterpiece - not only do I mildly prefer the group's previous album, which is a slightly fresher take on similar musical territory, but the group seem to be grasping for ideas a little here, to the point where some of the keyboard work on the opening track seems to recall Watcher of the Skies a little too closely for me to consider it a coincidence. It's still a great little listen, but I wouldn't say it's the sublime, definitive Italian prog album it's often put forward as; give it a go, but don't just the whole RPI genre on its merits."

          "text": "This is the only album I've heard from this band, and therefore I can't judge it against their output, but it is easily the best known internationally, helped by the fact that it was released also with English lyrics penned by Peter Hammill. Dealing with two doomed planets, it attempted to be a concept album (a fashion at the time) but it's debatable how well it succeeds to be a coherent and unified piece of art. I get the emotion of the music but not the narrative level as I don't speak Italian. (But I believe it could be possible to sense the story better than this without understanding lyrics, with the power of music alone.) The tracks remain more or less separate instead of flowing seamlessly. The running time of 33\ufffd minutes is sadly short (not rare with RPI!) but the music has truly deserved the classic status. Probably this would be among Top Ten of the most classic RPI albums - I mean this both objectively and subjectively.Often Le Orme (meaning 'footprint') is described as Italy's ELP, due to being a keyboard trio featuring a singing guitar/bass player. This doesn't give credit to their genuinely Italian nature. For instance Triumvirat is Germany's ELP as much as anything can be without being a mere clone. Le Orme has an aura that couldn't be anything else than Rock Progressivo Italiano. Besides Tony Pagliuca is not at all the same kind of an eccentric keyboard virtuoso as Keith Emerson. This is a compliment, mind you. The sound is for the most part very loaded with keyboards but in a different way than ELP's. Also Aldo Tagliapietra is far from Greg Lake. He's more or less typical RPI vocalist (now forget the operatic tenor of Banco!), comparable to PFM.The long and gorgeous opening track is followed by the sharp and bright song 'Felona' which gives the leading role to acoustic guitar. The rest of the album is mostly rather sad and dark-toned in a fine way. Even for a non-speaker of Italian the deep emotion is strong on this album. Michi Dei Rossi's drums are perhaps too buried in the mix; he's a sophisticated percussionist. So, solid four stars from me! Not five because it could be better in many levels (concept unity, production, length, even compositions that are a bit uneven against such shortness). By the way, great cover painting. I have a book \"A Romance of the Equator - Best Fantasy Stories by Brian W. Aldiss\" with almost similar picture."

          "text": "Standing somewhere between plain, boring and underwhelmingFor a very long time, since the inception of progressive rock itself, Italy has been a powerhouse of that genre of rock on continental Europe, giving birth to a considerable number of well-regarded bands on these circles. Le Orme is one of such bands. Starting as a psychedelic/baroque rock band in the late 1960's and evolving to a power trio formation in the vein of Emerson, Lake and Palmer on the turn of the decade, the band experienced some moderate success during their early days.As a lover of progressive rock music, I, of course, go in search of good music wherever it's from and, with the due time, Felona and Sorona reached my hands as I was shuffling through a second-hand shop. It is quite an old CD, by the way, being manufactured in Italy back in the late 1980's, but it is still in great shape overall. In spite of all that, I approached this album with some caution because I had no idea what was waiting for me and, even so, I was left disappointed. Actually, the only thing that did impressed me about this album is the fact that it is the best rated release by Le Orme, one of the best of the genre reserved for the (most part) symphonic bands from Italy and among the 100 top rated album of Prog Archives.Since the introduction is finished, let's get to the good (or should I say bad?) part: the music.First of all, Le Orme's formation, despite being exactly the same as other power trios such as the mentioned ELP, Triumvirat and Trace (and somewhat also related with Finch), the Italian band's music has no relation, nothing at all to do with mentioned bands because, for one, their music has no energy at all, it is impressively stagnant, having very littleprogressandinnovationat all; for two, which is related with the former reason, they take no risks with their instruments: with so many possibilities and \"what if\"s, they manage to keep it at the most basic form of progressive rock composition; for three, if they don't make an effort toinnovatehow they use their instruments, everything will (as it does throughout the album) get immensely boring because that formation (rhythm, bass line and melodic line), albeit being dome with other instruments, has existed since the inception of the most basic forms of music, so nothing will sound quite new,Second of all, the vocalist's voice is quite plain, average and indistinguishable from the voice of every other Italian singer. There is not anything redeeming about his singing abilities; he does not sing out of tune or anything in the like, but there is nothing quite positive about how he sings as well: it's just simple, unoriginal, it simply can't stand out from the crowd. Coupled with the equally underwhelming music, everything becomes one mass of uninteresting sound.Third of all, the compositions are also far from being anything close to entertaining. Every songs seems like a collage (pun intended) of different melodic lines with close to no transition at all. their music sounds quite disjointed at many times, specially in the only song (besides All'Inuori del Tempo) they were able to write that clocks over 3 minutes. The opener, actually, is the hardest song to sit through exactly because of that reason, only individual melodic lines sound coherent within themselves, but they have no relation among themselves. The other songs do suffer from this problem, but in a lesser degree because, after all, justhowcan you make a 3 minute song as disjointed?Moreover, the individual parts of each song, with very few exceptions, are not inspired as well. You can see their next move (within each part of each song, because you can never know what will come next since there is nothing between, there's no transition of musical ideas) even before they play it. Before this album, I imagined that one could only feel that one album lasts less than what it does (because it is so good you don't want it to end), but Felona e Sorona was able to prove that even an album with barely half-an-hour in length seemed longer than theQUADRUPLE ALBUMSabout Dante's Inferno released by Musea. Truly an outstanding feature that few can do, even more in the progressive rock circles, where music is supposed to be interesting and innovative.With all that considered, I must say that not everything is lost.Eventuallya glimpse of a redeeming moment appears. However, a split second later they change the melody completely, with no transition, allow me to make myself clear, and then everything goes back to sounding bland. It really strikes me as unbelievable how can they drown their interesting ideas in oceans of musically uninteresting ideas; interesting content is indeed few and far between.Rating and Final ThoughtsThe Italian prog scene never struck me as being quite special and even though it has some very powerful and notable exceptions, such as Premiata Forneria Marconi, Quella Vecchia Locanda, Locanda delle Fate, among others, most of the scene has nothing interesting to present at all. In my search for good progressive rock, however, I always tend to make concessions, try new bands, give an album many spins in order to cement my opinions about it, anyway, I try and evaluate it the best I possibly can.Having listening to this piece for a little more than two years, I don't believe my views on Felona e Sorona will change any time soon, so I believe it is time to put it out. It is all around a truly bad release. The only memorable thing about it for me is how terrible it sounds, how difficult it is to listen to it. For all that, 1 star is the most appropriate rating for it."

          "text": "Felona e Sorona from 1973 is considered the peak of Le Orme most creative period - first part of the '70. If previous album was a great one, this album tops it, is even more complicated, the arrangements are very well performed and the musicianship is top notch, but in same time very romantic in aproach, like on most italian prog bands. Some killer instrumental parts on opening track Sospesi nell'incredibile nearly 9 min of pure beauty, incredible organ passages, very reminescent in some parts with Genesis (Nursery cryme or Foxtrot era) but combined with Le Orme finest song writting and dexterity on instruments. Another highlight and probably my fav track from the album and one of their best from first period is L'equilibrio, impressive musicianship here, the ekyboards, bass lines, the druming is more then excellent, top notch piece that rivals with best from Genesis , Yes or other big names from this field. The multy keyboards layers, differse organ and mellotron parts with symphonic twists combined with great voice of Also Tagliapetra make from this album a treasure in prog world and together with previous album two of the best italian prog rock albums ever made. 4 stars easy and recommended."

LE ORME released FELONA E SORONA in both Italian and English but I have only heard the former. A fairly well known concept album about two planets revolving around each other but never making contact. Felona is the planet where everything works well and all is good while Sorona is darkened and suffers from plagues and catastrophes. In the second half of the album the planets experience a reversal of polarity and their fortunes become inverted.A very pleasant listen but to me this seems like a lofty concept for just over 33 minutes of music. I'm not fluent in Italian so i'm not sure what the lyrics represent. The music is great and I really like this album but it's not really dynamic enough for me to consider this a masterpiece. If the whole album was more like the last track \"Ritorno Al Nulla,\" I think i'd like this album more."

          "text": "I loved LE ORME's Uomo di pezza upon first listen and continue to do so to this day. But, try as I might, the magic that so many prog lovers feel for Felona e Sorona has completely eluded me. The recording of the electronic keyboards is unusually bad--almost painful to my ears. I have listened to this album for almost six years. I even went so far as to buy it about a year ago--in hopes that the physical presence might help win me over. But it just doesn't work. The drums and bass are so elementary. The vocals don't have any of the melodic hooks that I fell for in Uomo di pizza. Sure, there are awesome, memorable moments or passages, but overall, in my opinion, it does not maintain the highs of a prog classic. The opening number makes me feel as if I'm at cheesy county fair--though it does have a wonderful final two minutes. The second number is best for its recorder at the end. The third song is best in its sparseness--the piano accompanying Aldo. The upbeat fourth song is most remarkable for its keyboard beginning--which is similar to, and predates, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway by a year or more. The fifth song is sparse with guitar supplanting keyboards but really goes nowhere. \"Attesa\" is scarred (to my ears) by the odd sliding bass riff repeating itself over the disco drumming. \"Rittrato\" is simple and anthemic (and has the album's best drumming and best overall mix--until the L channel el gtr starts to get louder). \"All'infuori\" is the most daringly experimental on the album with its unusual drum opening, quick organ flourish and then guitar foundation all eventually coming together in a very medieaval sounding presentation--and then breaking down into a spacious gap of nothingness mid song. Again, simplicity and procession seem to reign here. The album's best song is its finale, \"Ritorno\" (from which, understandably, La Maschera de Cera found their inspiration to create their 2013 Felona e Sorona 'continuation,' La Porte del Domani), an instrumental which finally uses all of its band members' sounds in interesting and innovative fashion. Anyway, perhaps if I knew Italian the impact of the lyrics would boost this one for me. Otherwise, this is but a three and a half star production for me: better than good but not an album that I'm going to rave about on a \"highly recommended\" list."

          "text": "I knew that someday I would have to discover for myself what all the fuss was about with Rock Progressivo Italiano. That day came about two years ago now when I decided for my first foray into RPI \"Felona E Sorona\" would have to come home. From the first listen I was impressed and pleasantly surprised. For an album that is basically keyboards, bass and drums along with vocals (only some acoustic guitars and no electric guitars), I enjoy this album quite a bit.The concept has been discussed before but in brief it is the story of two planets, one prosperous and glorious the other destitute and plague-ridden, whose fates become inverted. Though I don't understand Italian more than the odd word, I like Aldo Tagliapietra's vocals and so I don't care about the language barrier. More so, I'm glad to hear him sing in his native tongue.Largely keyboard-based, there's an array of sounds produced by synthesizers, organ, and piano. The drums are also pretty intense at times, especially near the end of \"Sospesi nell'incredibile\" where I swear the drummer is seeing ants crawling over his kit and trying to smash each one!Acoustic guitar makes its appearance on \"Felona\", a cheerful song describing, I presume, the glorious planet. It's a short but very uplifting song that segues into \"La solitudine di chi protegge il mondo\". Most of the songs are pretty short, around three minutes or even shorter, but there's a variety of music and good use of keyboard sounds (I find \"Attesa inerte\" interesting for its 1980's video game synthesizer effect).The whole album is actually rather short but well thought out. I have found that my enjoyment depends a lot on my mood. Sometimes I think this is an exciting and brilliant piece of work while other times I find parts a bit vacuous with rather empty parts. It's all part of the mood in some of the songs. From every bit of sparseness comes something beautiful or rewarding.I don't know if this is the best album to hear for an introduction to Italian prog but it impressed me enough to go out and check out two more bands. Recommended!"

          "text": "After the settling step of \"Uomo di Pezza\", Le Orme aim higher, that is to combine music and lyrics in a real concept album (the previous two were not in all the respects) on a universe made up of two planets and a creator.The first piece, \"Sospesi nell'Incredibile\" (Suspended in the Incredible), almost nine minutes, the only long track in the whole Lp, is an absolute masterpiece (vote 9), thanks to the technique of the three musicians and the compositional skills of the trio (always helped by the master G.P. Reverberi). Pagliuca bases an engaging melody, playing, in some passages, four types of different keyboards (I suppose: organ, synth, electric piano, mellotron), two for each listening channel. After about three minutes comes the voice by Tagliapetra to introduce the theme of the concept album, centered on the two planets of Felona (always illuminated) and Sorona (always in the darkness). First there is a strophe and then a progression that leads to a more acute melody, which would be the refrain if it were not that \"Le Orme\" don't respect the conventional song, preferring to give space, in this first track, to instrumental excursions and in fact after the singing by Tagliapetra comes a melody dictated by his bass, which is deep while De Rossi performs a work of absolute value, unstable, to the drums. Finally comes the synth by Pagliuca that plays a variation on the theme, which slowly fades, leaving space to the gigantic work of De Rossi, uncontanaible. Masterpiece.Following are three songs linked together (Felona; La Solitudine di Chi Protegge il Mondo: The Solitude of the One Who Protects the World; L'equilibrio: The Balance; overall score 8). The first starts with the party bells, it's a simple folk acoustic ballad dominated by guitars. \"Donne e cicale discorrono d'amore\": \"Women and cicadas talk of love\", is a phrase that well represents the piece. After about two minutes there is a melodic passage on keyboards that leads to the next song, with a very dreamlike atmosphere that soon gives way to a melancholy melody; after another two minutes the fourth track arrives, which involves an aggressive rhythm, like the initial one, to underline the void between the two planets, the abyss that separates the two worlds. The music is perfectly in line with the text. This section lasts almost 4 minutes and has a beautiful instrumental tail, first conducted by the synth, then by a classical piano, then again by the synth, until the melodic, angelic part of the ending arrives. End of the first side. Applause.The second side opens with another short piece (Sorona, two and a half minutes), which with a sad, subdued tone, talks about the death of wheat and plants on the planet Sorona. The austere, almost church-like vocals by Tagliapetra gives a sound that is always very Spartan, Catholic, to the piece. It looks like a litany of a penitential act. Mixed to this ethereal mood, comes a more aggressive sound to the keyboards, \"Attesa Inerte\" (Inert Wait) withot a melodic development. The sequence of these two tracks is the weakest of the album (vote 7+). It joins an atmospheric piece (\"Ritratto di un Mattino\": Portrait of a Morning: vote 8), suffused, in which the voice of Tagliapetra sings the maximum of the album: \"La Felicit\ufffd non puoi trovarla in te ma nell'amore che agli altri un giorno darai: You can'not find happiness in you, but in the love you'll give to others one day\" followed by a melodic piece in solemn, triumphal \"crescendo\", with lots of final bells. The piano finally mixes this track with the next one (\"All'Infuori del Tempo: Outside of Time\", vote 7,5) \"that overlaps with the acoustic guitars reminding the second song for arrangement and mood and melody, which is serene but less festive. Again it's an acoustic folk ballad. The voice tells the happy ending: \"Due Mondi Felici Vibrano Insieme Nell'Arco del Cielo e Del Dolore Non c'\ufffd Ricordo, Soltanto Oggi Comincia la Vita: Two happy worlds vibrate together in the sky and there is no memory of sorrow, only today begins life\"... Then the music stops, the acoustic guitar starts again and the bitter end arrives: \"but while it still rejoices Sorona, Felona begins the Slow Inexorable Decline the Night Goes Down and the Balance Soon Ends, the End is the Circle, the Circle is Life, and is Destroyed and then Build Always Waits for Our Day, Doesn't Change Anything Outside of Time\". Very inspired lyrics. The last part is narrated with the same serenity of the beginning, as the end of a fable, which however bitter must be accepted knowing that life is a circle where it is destroyed to rebuild. Final moment with keyboards and bass. The ninth track, \"Ritorno al Nulla\" (Return to Nothing/Nowhere, vote 8+), is a titanic final piece, to seal the return to nothingness. Led by Pagliuca with the synths, without the beating on the snare, it seems the end of the world is coming... And in fact it's an end of the world!The concept album structure makes \"Felona e Sorona\", compared to \"Uomo di Pezza\", and especially to \"Collage\", an album much more narrated by the voice of Tagliapetra, formed by so many short sequences that don't leave much room for long instrumental digressions, which only focus in the last and in the first piece. The Lp almost seems like a theme music (Hector Berlioz) or a symphonic poem (Franz Liszt), where the lyrical part is sung. In any case, compared to Collage, what \"Felona e Sorona\" loses in surprise and originality and musical improvisation, it gains in homogeneity of arrangement and in the synergy of the union between lyrics and music that is really inspired and completely in unison. This album is the second small masterpiece signed \"Le Orme\".Medium quality of the songs: 8. Vote album: 9. Rating: Five Stars."

          "text": "Le Orme is considered to be a major '70 symphonic prog group from Italy. The band uses almost every keyboard sound from the ELP pallet. Yet, Le Orme ends up sounding more authentic because of the cultured Italian footprint that relies less on virtuosity, but on beauty and sensitivity. The airy vocals by Aldo Tagliapietra are among the best of the Italian prog genre and the band uses the short song-burst to great effect between the electronic & symphonic interludes. Though there are some folky bits with acoustic guitar, the band mostly uses organ, synths, bass guitar and drums. On this album the band uses more electronics then usual, sometimes adding a spacey layer to the music. Whilst the atmospheres change between dark and melancholic to optimistic and energetic, most of the album is actually quite dark - which I like. 'Felona E Serona' is a concept album mostly made up of shorter songs. It does however sound more like a single multi-part epic, also because of the short running time of 34 minutes. In Italian progressive music I usually get bothered by the slightly out of tune synths and 'Felona E serona' isn't an exception. Otherwise, this would have been a masterpiece - for it clearly has that memorable edge to it.The remastered Universal vinyl reprint has a nice warm sound to it. I couldn't find any of the problems with the production sound that others have described in such detail."

          "text": "While \"Uomo Di Pezza\" had solidly displayed Le Orme's progressive credentials, the conceptual \"Felona E Sorona\", their fourth album, went a step further, reaching the band's creative peak. The fanciful story of two planets, Felona and Sorona, opposing and at the same time complementary, contrasting the prosperity and happiness of one with the gloomy despair and sorrow of the other under the supervision of a superior entity, serves as narrative inspiration for the instrumental deployment of a proposal that metaphorically and without stridency or labyrinthine developments conveys the circular concept of life. The extensive and introductory \"Sospesi Nell'Incredibile\" masterfully describes the coexistence of both planets in the universe, making use of the cosmic keyboards of Antonio Pagliuca accompanied by the percussion of Michi Dei Rossi with a final solo included and by the melodious and welcoming voice of Aldo Tagliapietra in between; while the festive \"Felona\" with Tagliapietra's luminous and comfortable acoustic development and the sorrowful \"Sorona\" with Pagliuca's dramatic and thick keyboards, differentiate the two realities. That troubling disparity is observed in the vaporous melancholy of \"La Solitudine Di Chi Protegge Il Mondo\" and the reflective \"L'Equilibrio\", and leads to the discontent of Sorona's inhabitants reflected in the tense \"Attesa Inerte\", dissipating with the light of hope that the mysterious \"Ritratto di un Mattino\" brings and that \"All' infuori Del Tempo\" with Tagliapietra's acoustic guitars and Pagliuca's keyboards transforms into happiness for Sorona just when Felona starts the reverse process. The instrumental and overwhelming \"Ritorno al Nulla\" with the growing drama that the moog and the rest of the keyboards and percussions bring, closes the work epically.Although Le Orme kept the trio format similar to the referents E,L&P, \"Felona E Sorona\", one of the cornerstones of Italian progressive rock, follows a path with more melodic components and less grandiloquent structures than those of the British, shining with its own light, and projecting the band to the Anglo-Saxon market by releasing the English version of the album afterwards.4.5 stars"

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "name": "LE ORME",
      "genre": "Rock Progressivo Italiano",
      "country": "Italy",
      "biography": "Founded in  Marghera, Venice, Italy in 1966 - Hiatus from 1982-1986 - Still active as of 2019\n\nExcellent early-70's Italian progressive trio (still around today) with classical stylings, featuring keyboards to the fore and a unique dreamy/powerful style. Le ORME was one of the three major Italian groups, the other two being PFM and BANCO. This band is usually considered as the Italian EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER and even BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO by the Italian singing. Its music is based upon organ developments and soli reminding Seventies groups which works are essentially built upon keyboards parts.\n\nThe band's truly classic period begins with their third next releases. \"Uomo Di Pezza\" (1972) is one of Le Orme's definitive Italian progressive rock albums. Although there is definitely an significant EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER influence here, as in the bombastic Moog and Hammond workouts countered by mellow balladry. It's not quite as integrated a feel as would characterize their next two albums, \"Felona E Sonora\" and \"Contrappunti\", though its fantastic nonetheless, and one of Le ORME's three essential albums. \"Collage\" and especially \"Florian\" offer a music tinged with classical music. \"Felona E Sonora\" (1973) is probably one of my top favorite Italian progressive rock albums. \"Contrappunti\" (1974) is another fantastic Le ORME album, and really the close of their classic trilogy. This album would effectively close out the band's streak of success.\n\n\"In Concerto\" is an excellent live album from 1974 with many unreleased tracks. \"Piccola Rapsodia Dell' Ape\" is more recent, an excellent mixing of Progressive and Italian baroque music. \"Collage\" and especially \"Florian\" offer a music tinged with classical music. In 1993 the Japanese progrock label Crime Records released the 2-CD \"Live Orme\" with live-material from '75-'77. A far more captivating document than \"In Concerto\" from '74.\n\nTheir story goes on. After \"Piccola Rapsodia Dell' Ape\" (1980), in 1982 the band decides to break up. In 1986 they rejoin only for concerts but in 1990 a further work is issued (\"Orme\"). In 1992 Tony Pagliuca leaves the band, replaced by Michele Bon. That year they obtain the title of best Live-Act band seen in Italy. They never give up symphonic prog and their further works show it clearly. In spite of the success obtained by their live performances, in 1996 they publish a suite (\"Il fiume\"). After obtaining a great success at the Los Angeles PROG FEST and at the PROG EAST in Quebec, they commit themselves to the new work which will be finished in 2001 (\"Elementi\"). This latter, together with \"Il fiume\", will be part of a trilogy completed, in 2004, by \"L'infinito\". The trilogy, a mix of songs and instrumental pieces, tells about the mankind through the 4 elements of the universe. In 2005 they are invited at the NEARFEST concert in Pennsylvania. Their music may well be considered as a continuous commitment in PROG ROCK: over the last 42 years they never gave up their passion. They also tried to convey PROG Rock to the people by participating to song contests such as Festival di Sanremo, a very popular TV music happening in Italy. LE ORME is one of the few foreign bands who have been produced by a British label. The Famous Charisma Label issued \"Felona e Sorona\" in English, lyrics by Peter Hammil, after their tour in England in 1973.\n\nSee also:\n\nAldo TAGLIAPIETRA\n\nHERE",

          "text": "The Swedish progressive metal band PAIN OF SALVATION is a band in constant progress and with a very personal approach to their music. They're becoming more and more complex and the compositions gets better and better with every new album. It's no exaggeration to say that they're marching in the forefront (together with DREAM THEATER), breaking new grounds and stretching the boundaries of progressive metal again and again. Their new concept album about a fractured relationship, titled \"Remedy Lane\" is no exception. Their previous album \"The Perfect Element Part I\" from 2000 was as good as a progressive metal album can ever get, so it's hard to say which is the better one of these two.The musicians are surpassing themselves and that goes for the vocalist, guitarist and composer DANIEL GILDENL\ufffdW too. DANIEL is an outstanding composer. Just listen to masterpieces such as \"Fandango\", \"A Trace Of Blood\", \"Rope Ends\", \"Dryad Of The Woods\" and \"Beyond The Pale\" and you'll know what I mean. Music like that has to come from a real genius. There are lots of rhythm & mood changes, complex arrangements and lengthy intricate instrumental passages. It sounds as if every note is there for a reason, and not for the individual musician's need to show-off. This is far from easy listening, and it takes a lot of patience and time to fully understand and appreciate the music and the lyrics.\"Remedy Lane\" was released in January, but it's already obvious that it's one of the highlights of 2002. Even though I'm a big DREAM THEATER fan and still consider them as the kings of progressive metal, I must confess that PAIN OF SALVATION is the worthiest successors to the progressive metal throne. I'm proud of being a Swede!"

          "text": "This album has successfully created a superb stream of music that flows beautifully from track 1 right through track 13 and .. provides the true and \"ultimate\" satisfaction to the mind of music buffs [my view]. After the success of Perfect Element Part 1, the band returns with thiswonderfully craftedalbum. As for comparison, this album is at par excellent with previous one. For my personal taste, this is something new for me as I have never heard the kind of music both albums have produced. But I would say now that I'm totally hooked to the band. They are really geniuses that have created unpredictable, never imagined before, but amazing music.The album kicks off with \"Beginnings\" with guitar fills, vocal and augmented with a keyboard sound at background in mellow style. It turns into higher register notes with full music. It flows almost seamlessly with a melodic \"Ending Theme\". The simple guitar fills have created excellent nuance of this track and have projected a trademark of the band's music.\"Fandango\" opening part provides a spacey mood with some symphonic touch. It sounds like the music and voice line do nit move in the same direction but it creates powerful harmony before the chorus line.\"A Trace Of Blood\" intro sounds like (nuance-wise)Peter Gabriel's tune \"On The Air\" [my taste and my view; you may disagree with me - it's okay, this is prog world, my friend .]. Of course both of them have different textures. When guitar solo enters the music with riffs at background, it provides a nice platform for vocal to enter the music.\"This Heart Of Mine (I Pledge)\" starts completely mellow. Halfway through, the music turns in higher register notes with excellent guitar solo. It then ends up in a mellow style. \"Undertow\" - this track has subconsciously penetrated firmly into my mind, because I was struck when listening to the acoustic version in 12:5 album. When it enters this track, the melody really rang me a bell that I got used to hear it. And I went back to previous albums of PoS and found out in this album. Yes, this track is very easy for listener to emulate as it's a kind of ballad song, composed and performed in simple structure.\"Rope Ends\" has a very strange opening where all instruments played at the same time but \"look like\" each of the instrument has different direction (melody wise) with unusual time signatures. When voice line enters the music, its melody is catchy and memorable. The tempo changes are also composed nicely with smooth transition. When it enters interlude part with guitar solo, there's a kind of eastern music nuance. The guitar solo itself is stunning. After interlude part, the music goes to an excellent transition before it finally returns to original tagline melody / harmony. It's a superb track! One of my PoS favorite tracks.The opening guitar fills and also the tagline melody of \"Chain Sling\" is catchy and has become something that I always emulate whenever I'm with no sound of music (be it in the business meeting, or other occasion where listening to music is impossible and/or inappropriate). That's the beauty of having prog mind - prog music has always flown in my mind, every time! Oh man, I love the kind of music Pain of salvation plays.\"Dryad Of The Woods\" closes the chapter brilliantly through the exploration (and improvisation) of acoustic guitar augmented with symphonic keyboard style. Fantastic! If this track is enjoyed as a stand alone track, you may perceive it as neo progressive rock vein but as it happens with this album that it's part of four-piece song under a chapter 3 of the track. So, it projects different nuance if we put it under this perspective.\"Remedy Lane\" is a short track exploring keyboard, guitar and strange drum beats / percusiion work. It provides a sound atmosphere for next track to enter our zone of musical enjoyment through \"Waking Every God\". This track is performed in relatively fast tempo with high tonal voice.\"Second Love\" opens with a mellow style with excellent guitar fills and low register vocal. It's kind like a ballad / slow rock song for this album, with strong melody - of course. Piano accentuates the harmony and melody really well. This track is accessible to most music buffs, I think.\"Beyond The Pale\" concludes the album. The guitar intro is performed in strange fashion with repetitive chords - but . it's not boring at all. It's probably thee vocal line that comes with it has made the piece has a terrific sound. Amazingly this repetitive chords happen for a long period augmented with riffs and energetic vocal. When the voice turns higher, the music changes in another musical landscape. Believe me, this track is amazing!Highly recommendedalbum that you should not miss at all. It has a crispy musical concept, tight and powerful songwriting, and flawless delivery. This kind of music would set the future of progressive music [my view].Keep on progging!!- GW, Indonesia."

          "text": "A depressing rock opera like 'The Wall' except that this one is metal!But not only metal, this really defines what progressive metal should be like. Dream Theater plays lots of solos and extended pieces, but this album fuses many elements (rock, metal, ballads, pop, rap, jazz), is very complex and difficult, and has great lyrics. Daniel composed all of this on his own which interests me how gifted this musician is. Not to forget, his vocal range is phenomenal!! He decided to write a concept album based on his life, and unfortunately ... it is very depressing and dark in tone.Beginnings and Ending Theme begin the album in a very heavy way, full of electric distorted guitars and heavy rhythms. Fandango changes the pace of the album and is probably the most difficult song to get into: All of its rhythms are done in very strange time signatures and styles. At the end, Daniel screams in extremely high notes (how does he do it?). This Heart of Mine begins with a great instrumental intro and leads into a very sad song (read the heartbreaking lyrics about a miscarriage). This Heart Of Mine is a nice love song with very nice melodies. Undertow is one of the big highlights of the album : A repetitive, yet never boring, dark melody is played on the guitar, then sung, then screamed desperately. Rope Ends is another depressing and anxious song about a mother (maybe his own mother) attempting suicide 3 times : the first two times, she doesn't take her life; the third time she dies. Musically and melodically, this song is another standout of the album. Chain Sling deals with breaking up with his loved one. Dryad of the Woods is a lonely soft piece that is very well arranged with piano, and acoustic instruments (another big highlight of the album). Remedy Lane has very strange synthesizers for two minutes, yet it sounds good. Waking Every God is a typical metal song and is my least favourite track of the album. Second Love is another love song (But this one is sad) and Beyond the Pale ...... Sums up the whole album and it is a masterpiece lyrically and musically. The lyrics basically add up all of his feelings of hate, pain, sadness and confusion. Musically, this song goes through all these feelings. The introducion is constructed in a similar way to Pink floyd's 'High Hopes'. IT contains a strange acoustic riff repeating itself for over a minute while Daniel sings in amazing melodies in a mellow and dark tone. It is magnified with very heavy electric guitar riffing and explodes in a symphonic riff heard in 'Chain Sling' with some sharp 'one-word' growls. The climax is hit in the middle part of the song when the singer brings back references of the past songs in a heavy metal passage. The style of singing is between rap and numetal. After the climax, verses/choruses are repeated and the song ends with the 'We will always be so much more human then we wished to be' lyrical line.1. Beginnings (7/10) 2. Ending Theme (7.5/10) 3. Fandango (8/10) 4. A Trace Of Blood (8/10) 5. This Heart Of Mine (8/10) 6. Undertow (9/10) 7. Rope Ends (8/10) 8. Chain Sling (8/10) 9. Dryad Of The Woods (9/10) 10. Remedy Lane (8/10) 11. Waking Every God (6/10) 12. Second Love (8/10) 13. Beyond The Pale (10/10)My Grade : Brecommended!!"

          "text": "One of Sweden's many fantastic bands, PoS has repeatedly blown away listeners with every album by constantly evolving and maturing with their sound. With the distinctive and amazing vocals of Gildenlow, the plethora of musical styles and influences seamlessly entwined into their music, amazing lyrics, deep and thoughtful concepts, and the pure passion of the music, it's hard not to like this band, as many people here would agree. I thought it would be impossible for PoS to top their beautiful 2001 album The Perfect Element part 1. After a month of listening to it I called it The Perfect Album. Never before had I heard anything like it. See my review for more. With Remedy Lane, PoS has matured again and surpassed all expectations. It's also, besides BE, their most varied and most difficult to get into of them all. Not saying any of their stuff is easy to get into...but this has so many different styles, it's difficult to swallow quickly. Once you have fully digested the album, though...it's almost a masterpiece. Almost. The Perfect Element still outdoes it, but just barely. The only reason this is a four star review instead of five is because The Perfect Element is so amazing. Much like why Lightbulb Sun or Ghost Reveries only get 4 stars...because respectivelly, In Absentia and Blackwater Park are so amazing and better.The thing that pushes this album into the realm of really wonderful albums...I don't think too many exist, masterpieces that is...is the amazing lyrics and vocals. This album focuses on the life of lead singer Daniel Gildenlow and his many problems. The main problem I believe talks of Daniel and his exposure to sex and whatnot as a child and how he eventually did something bad...take a guess what...to someone he cared about. Another problem, as seen on \"A Trace of Blood\" talks of his wife's miscarriage. Just following along with lyrics and listening to the song and the emotion makes you truly understand the album and why it is the way it is. It makes the album much more amazing and profound.Musically and songwriting-wise, it's no slouch either...I'd rank it as better than any of their other albums except TPE part 1, and just barely lower than that. The album opens with \"Of Two Beginnings\", which is a perfect intro and really throws you into things. \"Ending Theme\" is more simplistic but incredibly addictive, mostly because of the vocal performance and the feel of the song. The speech in the middle is one of the parts of the album tha is fascinating to follow along with with the lyrics.Fandango is probably the only typical PoS song as defined on OHBTCL on this album. It's very very progressive and technical and has good emotion, but unless you really dig EVERYTHING on OHBTCL (which I don't), this song is only very good. Luckily, the next song, A Trace of Blood, is phenomenal. Please, follow this one with the lyrics, it makes it so much better. It's very dynamic and the vocal performance is amazing as usual. The chorus is incredibly addictive and everything about it is very easy to listen to yet awesome in every way. Might be my favorite song on the album.I started off hating This Heart of Mine, but now I love it. Good lyrics, really nice to listen to, emotional, good stuff. A very pleasant laid back song. Undertow is more laid back and is in the same style as Chain Sling...focuses on soft parts leading into fairly loud parts. Great guitar work all around, good stuff. In between them is Rope Ends, which is probably the heaviest song on the album. Very dynamic, much like A Trace of Blood. The beginning has some very interesting rhythms going on, difficult to follow. The chorus gets a little annoying, but whatever. The second segment ends with Dryad of the Woods, which is a nice laid back instrumental with nice melodies and guitar parts.The final segment opens with the two-minute title track, which explores some nice keyboard and drum work all around. It just goes through several earlier melodies of the album and is a great way to open the third part. Waking Every God is a more energetic track, similiar to Fandango except a little more pleasent with melodies, good basswork on this one, that always sticks out. Pleasent song, more good vocal work. Next is Second ove, which is good, in the vein of This Heart of Mine, except not as memorable. The \"I want you to know, I can't sleep any more\" part is great, though. Not bad, though. Beyond the Pale, the last track, uses a repetitive guitar part the whole song, but it never gets boring. It's another wonderful track with great dynamics throughout. A killer track.So...I give this a 4.4999999. It's not a five star, but it's so unbelievably close...it's a masterpiece of progressive rock/metal, but it's just not on the same level as the ones I've actually rated five stars. I'm really torn on this one...just buy it anyway."

          "text": "I have read a lot of good things about this group so the expectation was already set. I was not disappointed. As with many progressive rock albums that I hear I wasn't too sure if I was going to like it after the first few tracks. As the album progressed my interest and curiosity were aroused recurrently. \"Beginnings\" is kind of strange, complete with some death growls that had me looking for the nearest mosh pit. I had no need for concern as this was only one infinitesimal element of the entire presentation that they had in store for me. By the time track six rolled around I really was getting into it. \"Undertow\" is the beginning of the second half of the album, and a different sound takes precedence that doesn't let go until the end. What I heard was a likeness to the great prog-rockers Pink Floyd and Queensryche. This is only a likeness I noticed mind you, they have their own style and sound, so don't think if you buy this disc you will be getting a copycat of the legendary prog-rockers of yesteryear.\"Waking Every God\", \"Second Love\", and \"Beyond The Pale\" are full scale magnum opuses complete with lush intricate acoustic string arrangements, great upfront vocals, and adept background vocals, backed by rocking guitar and thumping and pumping drums and bass ... it's the utter epitome of prog-rock. These guys can rock and make some beautiful music all in the same song. It's done in typical genre like fashion with quick and unexpected changes; it's a total rush of exponential energy.From a straight up emotional connection stand-point, this is one of the best records ever made. No false bravado, no forced melancholy, no faux-gloomy suicidal claptrap. Remedy Lane is a chronicle of events in the life of Daniel Gildenlow, and as such his emotion and lyrical genius shines through in every song (save perhaps \"Second Love\"). I'm not sure Daniel is the singer some people think he is as his voice is often overly high- pitched without being forceful, but he certainly knows how to emote and alter his tone as the song demands. Furthermore, most of the rest of the group sing as well, and they help carry the load passably.Very little of this is really metal though to be quite blunt about it. It's just plain prog and the few heavy riffs that sneak in aren't really arranged in a way that screams 'metal' at you. \"Rope Ends\", with it's schizoid unconventional riff is the only song that rocks from beginning to end, and it is written in such a way that it could just easily be called prog rock.The counterpieces of Remedy Lane:Ending theme - has a really dark mood, with soothing vocals from Daniel. It has a great sing-a-long chorus and an awesome talking part, which is a real challenge to learn.A Trace of Blood - This is the best song on the album, it is about the miscarriage Daniel's wife had. It is a really sad song, with lots of mood changes. Daniel shows anger, frustration, sadness and despair in a fantastic way. The song just clocks over 8 minutes long and with all the time changes, it has a really epic feel.This Heart of mine - This is a beautiful love song, one of the most sincere love songs i've ever heard. It definately comes from the heart without being cheesy. This song also has a special meaning for me.Rope Ends - One of the best songs on the album, one of the few songs that is actually riff based. Starts out with a nice riff and great drumming, then leads into this awesome chorus, which will be stuck in your head forever.Dryad of the woods - A beautiful crafted instrumental, a really uplifting song. The combination of acoustic guitar and piano makes it really impressive to listen to, great atmosphere.Beyond the Pale - This song closes the album in style. It's an epic song just like the Perfect Element. It starts out with an odd riff which is really interesting, then the song goes through a lot of tempo and mood changes. Daniel's vocals really shines on this song, it is really impressive. The song ends with one of the greatest lines ever: 'We will always be so much more human than we wish to be'.Daniel does seem to get around, because this album recounts an astounding number of tragedies involving women starting from the age of 10 (!), the man displaying an almost hyper-sexual need to be around females and more worrying, for being around females who are shrouded in disaster. From the tragic miscarriage of \"A Trace of Blood\" to the scarred untouchable love in \"Ending Theme\", everybody becomes removed from the protagonist in some way. The lyrics are occasionally a little more verbose than they need to be, but in general there is a real gift for memorable phrases (often repeated throughout the story) and getting across emotions like pain, sorrow, and uhhh... pain.It should also be noted that there is plenty of extra poetry in the liners that is quite a bit of fun to muddle through and try to figure out what is going on with the story.Remedy Lane certainly operates on a number of levels, and presents a story that is moving on the same high level as the concepts of such legendary albums like Operation:Mindcrime or The Wall. It's intellectual, classy, and thought-provoking.I love their name, and I love this album. Salvation can be painful; it's getting there that's the hardest part, but once you do your hell becomes heaven. Join me and have a stroll down remedy lane. It's one of the best albums in the 00's so far and in POS's catalogue only close surpassed by The Perfect Element Pt.1.album rating: 9.5/10 points = 97 % on MPV scale = 5/5 starspoint-system: 0 - 3 points = 1 star / 3.5 - 5.5 points = 2 stars / 6 - 7 points = 3 stars / 7.5 - 8.5 points = 4 stars / 9 - 10 points = 5 stars"

          "text": "The first thing that strikes you about Pain of Salvation, if this album is, like mine, your first exposure to them, is that as a Prog Metal band they are decidedly different to the rest of the crowd.\"(Of Two) Beginnings\" starts with vocals that are bear an uncanny resemblance to Derek Dick, with low-octave doubling to add presence. The other obvious resemblance is in the lyrics, which echo \"Hotel Hobbies\" from \"Clutching at Straws\" for the first verse, at least - but there, of course, the similarities end.For these lyrics are in no way similar to Fish's - they are at a much simpler level, with no references to great literature, no word games with multiple levels of meaning, no guessing - just in your face lyrics whose frankness sickens me a little and makes me wish they weren't so clear.The lyrics are about relationships, when it all comes down to it - but not at the intellectual level that Neo-Prog was so great at portraying, more at the angsty level but without references to literature, except blatant ones.6th form stuff, in other words.And so back to the music - which is, after all, the really important bit!When the huge power chords kick in, we're pretty much in Dio territory - and jolly nice and powerful it is too.It's very interesting that \"Ending Theme\" should follow \"Of Two Beginnings\" (which is really 1st person perspective, so only about one beginning really, but that's nit- picking), and PoS seem to use Muse as their inspiration - it's kind of like hearing Matt Bellamy an octave lower.The melodies are very strong - my only criticism is that they are incredibly derived, and completely obvious - but by the same token, very accessible and enjoyable, and the shifting rhythms produce a nice Prog kind of feel - but as with \"Of Two Beginnings\", PoS build passages from shifts between two chords with occasional shifts to a different pair.\"Fandango\" reminds me of where Muse suddenly drop into a Tango in \"Megalomania\" (Origin of Symmetry), but has that wannabe prog feel to it - which, it has to be said, is the first time I've heard that aspect on this album. A tight rhythm focus means that the melodies are dull and predictable until the chorus, where things get much better - but this underlines the basic structure here: Intro, Verse, Chorus... you know where this is going.Lyrically, this is probably the most interesting, with some sage advice about living your life rather than wasting time thinking about it. We also get some literary references - but these are pure name-drops to Peter Pan and Tolkien. The story of the two protagonists mentioned in the first song is developed in a slightly fantastical way - a bit too restrained for my tastes, but applaudable enough.What else is interesting here? Well, there are some nice, simple piano textures, some guitar noodling and a few wooshy effects. Overall a cool soundscape, but one that seems more interesting than the actual music in this song - which is clearly not a Fandango, BTW.Around 4 minutes everything drops away to a simple bass line, which builds up via pedal riffs and piano ostinato - a cool bridge back to the verse and coda.\"A Trace of Blood\" is really unremarkable - a kind of melodic Iron Maiden song, replete with Dickinson-esque vocals. Disappointing for an 8+ minuter, it's about 4 minutes too long.\"This Heart of Mine\" shows some Gabriel inspiration in the vocals - if Gabriel ever sang a pop song! The whole ambience of this song is of a laid-back AOR type soft-jazz flavoured ballad replete with soft-sixth chords, and builds predictably to a singalong section. Very nice, but not Prog.\"Undertow\" gives Gildenrow a later Gabriel sound, and has some pleasantly unusual textures that create a cool \"old European town\" flavour that reminds me strongly of at least one Radiohead song, but with more predictable chord changes in the simple progressions.With lyrics like\"Let me break! Let me bleed! Let me tear myself apart I need to breathe! Let me lose my way! Let me walk astray! Maybe to proceed... Just let me bleed!\"We're in a kind of morbid singalong territory, and the sudden shock entry of \"Rope Ends\" comes as a welcome respite to these ears - although with the almost Meshuggah- like intensity, they may not treat the ears of the average Progger kindly - but who's \"average\"? ;0)The Boom-tsh accompaniment to the next section is utterly nasty, so skipping this one is a really good idea, as you won't miss anything really progressive from here onwards.There's a bridge at 3:20, but it's built largely on a single repeated idea that gets old very quickly, despite the shredding display atop it and the poor attempt at a funky- boogie riff a minute later.\"Chain Sling\" begins with a kind of acoustic guitar riff that is joined by a didgeridoo, if my ears don't decieve me, and Gildenrow adopts a soft Fish-like falsetto as the music builds, then drops into a more comfortable Bruce Dickinson sound.I won't dissect any more tracks, as I think I've managed to convey the essential flavours of this album quite well and have no wish to repeat myself. The one thing I can add is that there are more textural delights and great melodies to come - in this aspect, PoS deliver well, and the title track is worth hearing, the guitar solo in \"Second Love\" is a real highlight to an REO Speedwagon standard song, and the slap bass on \"Waking Every God\" is a real lowlight. The 10-minute \"Beyond the Pale\" is a bit of a snorefest, however and smacks of padding.In summary, then, a very interesting metal album, from a Progger's perspective, and both strong and rich in melody and textures. When taken for what it is, it is a really good album with highly enjoyable music that any Proghole might like occasionally - even if it's somewhat on the accessible side. Nothing wrong with a good tune!Ultimately, however, this is a simple riff-based metal album, and hardly a masterpiece of the Progressive Rock genre, so should not be taken as such.If you like this album, you should also investigate the music of Marillion, Muse, Renaissance and Jan Akkerman."

          "text": "The best work that PoS has to offer. Very ambitious and very interesting listen.A vast majority of this will put people off. The masterpiece here is all in Beyond the Pale, one of the greatest songs you are likely to hear, if you give it some time and understand its purpose.The other tracks are good to great, but the masterpiece here is the closing track, which delivers the message very clearly due to the unique choice of arpeggiated chords. Many will be bored by this repitition, they will not understand it and how it fits. They will not get the raw emotional power found in this song. Despite its harshness, its a very beautiful song with a message as powerful as you find in movies such as Apocalypse Now. It's not a sing-songy song. You aren't supposed to be singing along, you are supposed to be listening.The rest of the album is fairly typical Pain of Salvation, stuff you might could have heard on other albums. However, this is the best quality of the work they have done in their careers.Truly 4 and a half stars, but I don't believe it is quite \"up\" there as a total package of bliss."

          "text": "Unlike for their other releases the concept behind their fourth album \"Remedy Lane\" is not based on an abstract topic like maturing, death, religion or environment but can be rather considered a highly intimate disclosure of Daniel's very own personal problems. The 13 tracks on here are introducing us in at times frightening outright words to emotional and sad episodes from his own life like very early sexual experiences, a broken relationship, a stillbirth by his wife and a suicide by a mother of two children (his own mother?). The change in their style with inclusion of some more mellow and acoustic songs which started with their previous one \"TPE P.1\" has been consequentially continued here though \"Remedy Lane\" might need a couple of spins more to grow more on you but I must say I even prefer this album to its predecessor. Because, in fact apart from \"Second Love\" (being written by Daniel already around 1987) which is actually just a plain pop ballad there's not any real weak track to be found on here and moreover we get a bunch of highlights like \"Fandango\", \"A Trace Of Blood\", \"Undertow\", \"Rope Ends\", \"Chain Sling\" and \"Beyond The Pale\" to name just the strongest ones.I mentioned already that this album might not hit you right from the beginning, not like \"TPE Pt.1\" with highly memorable tracks as \"Used\" and \"Ashes\" but in opposite to this one \"Remedy Lane\" passes much better the \"test of time\" becoming better and better with every repeated spin. I'd like to express it like this that the previous one with its more abstract and general topic was a rather extraverted one whereas this one here is more its introverted, highly personal and emotional counterpart. As usually with PoS a closer look at the lyrics might help to dig the true beauty of this work. After the rather bombastic short opener \"Of Two Beginnings\" chapter one of the story starts in a more dreamy atmosphere with \"Ending Theme\". Daniel included here once again some rap type of vocals but this song sounds much different from \"Used\" without any resemblance to FNM transcending lots of emotions. \"Fandango\" is a great one as well with its slightly strange staccato rhythm and especially due to the extreme alternations of Daniel's voice from very dark and mystical to high-pitched yelling sounding highly interesting and versatile. \"A Trace of Blood\" in particular is very worthwhile to be listened to concentrating more on the lyrics which are very sad and telling about the tragedy of a stillbirth. Both the lyrics and the music are transcending very well this kind of sorrowful and powerless feeling. Then there's \"This Heart of mine (I pledge)\" which closes the first chapter and though this one was never one of my favs right from the beginning, I've to say this love song has its great moments especially when it's getting more upbeat but still I would say not to be considered a highlight of this album.Second chapter opens with the frowning, sentimental more ballad-esque \"Undertow\" which once again mainly lives from Daniel's great expressive voice and builds up an enormous tension during its running time. This one's followed by the next highlight \"Rope Ends\" being more upbeat with a nice catchy chorus but as well some nice versatile solo sections. Like with \"A Trace of Blood\" the story been told here is again an extremely touching one about a mother who decided to commit suicide. Next one \"Chain Sling\" is one of my favs on here, a driving and quirky one with a very nice Celtic flair. The highly appealing classically inspired acoustic ballad \"Dryad of the Woods\" is closing the second chapter which is (for me) the strongest one of this disc without any single weak track. BTW there are nicely fitting lyrics for this one to be read in the booklet.Third chapter is opened by the title track having a highly synth-dominated sound and taking up again the main themes \"Ending Theme\" and \"Rope Ends\". This one doesn't sound that much convincing to me and probably plays rather a role of an interlude. Next two tracks \"Waking every God\" and \"Second Love\" I'd consider less essential as well. The former one is more a kind of melodic straight forward hard rock song and the latter one a nice love ballad (which wouldn't be out of place on a Bonjovi album though). Fortunately and finally this chapter still has a great highlight to offer with the longest track on here \"Beyond the Pale\" developing into a versatile powerful and also atmospheric piece of music.As a summary I can say that \"Remedy Lane\" though having a few weak tracks (as did have \"TPE Pt.1\" as well) has to be considered (once again) an excellent record by PoS. I would say it's their most touching one and actually I find it a pity that the concept is mistaken by many people with an ordinary teenager's problem of a lost love. I'd like to tell all those people that there's definitely more behind this album and that it's really rewarding to give it a closer look and listen. At least to me it could offer me much more in the long run than \"TPE Pt.1\" did but that's just my very personal impression being aware that most people prefer that one."

          "text": "It's not very often that an album exceeds the hype or my expectations, but this one sure did ! PAIN OF SALVATION have created an emotional and personal work that is truly a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows.The first song \"Of Two Beginnings\" is a very passionate and powerful song with some great bass lines. \"Ending Theme\" has this undercurrent of bass and drums that builds and some great vocals. \"Fandango\" opens with some intricate guitar as some heavy drums roll in with a keyboard melody over the top.The vocals are theatrical. \"A Trace Of Blood\" is about Daniel's wife's miscarriage. The mood shifts are drastic, from uplifting to brooding. There is some high voltage guitar riffs and solos as well as some excellent piano melodies.The vocals are passionate to angry. \"This Heart Of Mine (I Pledge)\" is a lighter song with laid back vocals, a beautiful song that reminds me somehow of The FLOWER KINGS. \"Undertow\" is an emotional song with a climactic ending of pounding drums and powerful vocals.There is a reprise of \"This Heart Of Mine\" in the chorus of this song.\"Rope Ends\" opens with some fantastic instrumental work that is intricate and the interplay is great. The piano and guitar melodies are terrific. \"Chain Sling\" is an uptempo song that opens with some more intricate guitar and higher ranged vocals. \"Dryad Of the Woods\" is a beautiful, uplifting instrumental. Sometimes music is too gorgeous for words. \"Remedy Lane\" is another great instrumental with some good synth work. \"Waking Every God\" features some great sounding drums and some wondrous guitar melodies later in the song. \"Second Love\" is beautiful ! With tasteful guitar, fragile vocals at times and gorgeous piano. \"Beyond the Pale\" opens with unusual guitar sounds. The song is heavy with angry to soft vocals and a stunning guitar solo.Well I love the sound these guys create, especially the heavy passages that at times remind me of TOOL and DEADSOUL TRIBE. This is my favourite POS album."

          "text": "Take this walk down Remedy LaneOf all the Pain of Salvation albums I own, I seem to listen to this one the least. I can't really understand why, either, because I think this album is excellent. There's something about this album that I can't quite put my finger on, but rest assured that aura of mystery is something that makes this album truly great. Resting between the masterpiece of The Perfect Element and before the overly-ambitious project that was Be, Remedy Lane is undoubtly one of the most complex Pain of Salvation albums in terms of arrangements and what is actually going on.Sure it won't get the recognition that The Perfect Element gets, but Remedy Lane has much to offer that any other Pain of Salvation album won't. As a concept, it's one of the more palatable albums they've released, with an idea not as cryptic as The Perfect Element and not nearly as contrived as Be. Daniel Gildenlow's story of childhood and growing up is a winding path that explores many different sentiments, feelings, and emotions, but the unifying trend of this album, in my opinion, is mystery. It's also yields some of the bands more gorgeous acoustic material, I speak in particular about the beautiful instrumental Dryad of the Woods, which creates a soothing atmosphere in contrast to some of the more jagged moments.Musically, this album has some of the group's most complex material. Just listen to Rope Ends, although the main motif is in a 4/4 time signature, one would not think that because of it's oddly accented beats and it's heavy use of syncopation by the band. The band is able to contrast the heavy moments brilliantly with the soft and somber moments, as well, not unlike that of Opeth (although they don't go for the gothic feel that Opeth does). Songs like This Heart of Mine and Second Love are lush ballads with gorgeous vocal performances from everyone, Daniel Gildenlow in particular (who grips the listener vocally with ripping performances on nearly every song).While no masterpiece, Remedy Lane continues to impress me and is a perfect musical continuation of what The Perfect Element was trying to explore. The entire album can be summed up with the closer, Beyond the Pale. Arguably the best closing song they've released to date, the song is wrought with brilliant melodies, vocals, and lyrical material, it concludes the album perfectly and remains one of the diamonds in the Pain of Salvation catalogue. As a whole, Remedy Lane is excellent, close to perfection, but it doesn't, in my opinion, reach that level. Highly recommended."

          "text": "Remedy LaneSimply amazing. This album shows how progressive metal, and metal songs, in wider perception, can be very beautiful, yet still have great technical virtuosity. Every single track of the album is a truly masterpiece, without any doubt. Another thing about the album is, as I said before, has that \"feeling\" that makes you smile, maybe cry when you listen to it. Straight five stars.This is actually my first Pain of Salvation album, although my first Pain of Salvation song was not from this album. There was a story behind it. A friend of mine gave me some copies of PoS tracks taken from \"Be\" album (legally, of course). Then I realised how cool this band was, because many people told me PoS is more or less similar to Dream Theater, Opeth, also maybe Ayreon. The music is very progressive, very metal, yet it is very easy-listening.Back to the album. As I mentioned above, Pain of Salvation's songs are magic combinations of the beauty of music and amazing musicianship. Meaning, while the songs have a very beautiful tone and lyrics, they can still included some incredible progressive aspects in the songs, such as odd time signature and extended solo. One example of these kind of songs is \"Fandango\" (track 3). From the beginning of the song, the bass line has a \"less-usual\" beat, followed by also odd drum lines, along with guitar lines. The most beautiful track, for me, is probably Second Love. This song is more like a ballad song, with a nice and \"crisp\" guitar tone. The lyric is also worth listening as well, taken from the song, \"I want you to know, I can't sleep anymore, by the night, by the night.\" Well yes, this is a song that has a very deep love aspect, which is not very common. However, after listening to the album several times, this song is a great compliment to the songs with very significant metal aspects.And just like every other great progressive rock/metal albums, the story of the album is worth-understanding as well. Quite similar to Ayreon's The Human Equation, the story is about a man's journey to discover himself, and dealt with love and passion.Bottom line, five big stars to Remedy Lane. My first Pain of Salvation album, and it showed me how great the band was, and is still great until today. I highly recommend you to buy the album and listen to it over and over again. This is not progressive metal album, this is a profound progressive metal album.I don't know what am I'm looking for - Imoeng"

          "text": "A very moving album, Remedy Lane has everything i seek in music: emotion, deep lyrics, excellent musicianship and creative arrangements. POS is definetely one of the strongest bands out there now, making true prog music and never being pretentious while giving no direction to their music. Their songs have a goal, transmit feelings to the listener through DANIEL's amazing vocal performances and the general beautiful and complex arrangements which make this band one of the few ones who should be considered \"prog metal\".There's not a bad song here, but there sure are some weaker ones mixed with real amazing masterpieces. \"Beginings\" and \"Ending Theme\" open the album just taking your breath away, with crying guitar solos a la Gilmour and dramatic vocals/melodies never falling into cheesy or overly tear-jerker territory, though. \"Fandango\" will just blow you away with its complexety, a very fast tempo and a song like i've never heard before. \"Chain Sling\" and \"Dryad of the Woods\" are also very worthy of attention, as well as the beautiful \"Second Love\". Yes my friends, this is a ballad on a prog metal album that is actually effective and not a commercial filler. The other songs are good, but i'm not a fan of the title track and i don't like some of the too heavier parts, like in the intros of a couple of tracks here.Overall, a stunning album that deserves to be appreciated by fans of all genres, since it is definetely not made to people go \"headbanging\", it is a very intelligent and complex piece of music that even fans of the mellower side of prog (CAMEL, GENESIS, PF) will be able to enjoy and admire."

          "text": "With The Perfect Element, Pain of Salvation was able to blend all of their strongest aspects together and even boost some of them, so the question is how do you follow up a near perfect album? Well, in Daniel Gildenlow's case, he decides to create an album with the central concept based around a very tragic moment in his and his wife's lives, the miscarriage of what would have been their first child, but with a few fictional events thrown in as well.Once again Pain of Salvation prove that it's the blend of deep emotional connection from the lyrics augmented by powerful, complex and feeling driven music that makes this such a great album in a similar way to its predecessor, The Perfect Element. As you can imagine, the overriding feeling of this album is very bleak and sad, punctuated by a couple of softer, calmer, more easily digestible songs, namely This Heart Of Mine ( I Pledge) and Second Love. The constant sense of loneliness and pain really does get to you with this album, bringing your mental state down a notch along the way with the previously named tracks being the only real let up to this and allowing the listener to recover a bit.The music the band play is maintained at an extremely high level that was set on their debut album, Entropia. In-fact, if there's one thing that can be said for it is that it has been made a bit more streamlined to make it more catchy, more commercial almost, but without sacrificing the complex layers and arrangements, just making them a little easier to get into and follow. However, this isn't actually easier to get into than The Perfect Element because of the downcast atmosphere, which can put some people off, or make it hard to listen to regularly. Also, despite the impressive quality of musicianship from them, many of the songs don't quite grab you so intensely, like past greats of Pain Of Salvation. However, as always, there are definite exceptions to this and in particular is A Trace of Blood, Rope Ends and Beyond The Pale. On these three songs, as well as numerous points throughout the album but most pronounced here, they show their incredible command of breathtaking structure, rhythm change and an all out feel of how to grab you and just rock. Listening to Beyond The Pale, from the opening clipped chords to the closing chant of Gildenlow, is an affirmation of why I love this band.This album is filled with moments and songs that I really love and enjoy listening to regularly, but the concept and its effect over, and with, the music makes it very difficult to get into for some people, and can easily be passed off as an angst filled rant, a stance that belittles the albums true nature. I do find, though, that it never quite grabs me in the same way that The Perfect Element did, a milestone that all of Pain of Salvation's albums will now be measured against, and in the end its this slight deficiency to its predecessor that holds it back from receiving 5 stars from me, though it gets incredibly close so I'll give it 4.5, rounded down to 4. A very worthy addition to any prog collection and a must have for most."

          "text": "After the acclaimed The Perfect Element Pt. 1, PoS decided to rest on their laurels and instead released this opus. Remedy Lane. The concept is , the similar to the one on One Hour By the Concrete Lake, which is introspection, but it's executed far better. Daniel fills every song with emotion and the rest of the band is more prominent than usual, but it's still Daniel's show. The story takes place over a few days in Hungary and travels through the range of human emotions.The album is split into three chapters, with the protagonist revisiting his memories. The story is somewhat autobiographical. \"A Trace of Blood\" deals with the pain of a miscarriage. \"This Heart of Mine (I Pledge)\" is a love song, but it's followed by \"Undertow,\" a dark piece revolving around the now-broken relationship. \"Rope Ends\" deals with attempted suicide. In the end, the painful memories create a sort of \"Remedy Lane\" that proves to be therapeutic.Daniel's vocals have always been astounding, but he gives his best performance on this album. He captures the range of human emotions as well, maybe even better, than Arjen Lucassen would do on The Human Equation. The flaw here, as with all PoS albums, is that the rest of the band gets little time to shine. However, there are more instrumental bridges this time around. This album is essential to prog metal fans and to those who have an interest in metal but don't like Dream Theater. Buy now.Grade: A"

Now, with all this i don't find Remedy lane a masterpiece, not by far, at some point is boring like short movies ( telenovela) from Soth America. This kind of metal i hered before in the '90, so is not big deal with this album, i don't know what is the fuss about Remedy lane. Some tracks that are better in my view are the instrumental one Dryad Of The Woods, and Remedy lane who sounds like keys of Manfred Mann but with modern techonology add on. My rating is 3 stars.

          "text": "\"Remedy Lane\" is another very interesting prog metal album I found via the enthusiasm of our own Sinkadoten. It's only my second PoS review, so I'm not qualified to rank it amongst their others, but I will say that I prefer the live \"Be\" material to this one. That said, this is still a heck of an album. Complex structures, unbelievable musicianship, good vocals, it's all there. One of the things that blows me away about this group are the guitar solos, of which there are not quite enough! Johan Hallgren has this amazingly interesting style of soloing that will be hard to explain, but I'll give it a shot. I don't know about you, but when I listen to many guitarists do their solos, my mind usually assimilates the song and player fairly quickly, and I can hear where the solo will go ahead of time. In other words, they're often predictable.Even on albums I've not heard a million times, you can get pretty good at just knowing where a player is going with something. But with Hallgren, I have noticed that he rarely goes where I expect him to, and he frequently surprises me. In addition to this he will also get to what you think is the end of a given run of notes, and then he'll tack on something extra right there where you would normally expect the next \"part\" to have already begun. I hope you can understand what I'm getting at. Both of these tricks make it really fun to listen to him play. I only wish he had more time on his own. He is usually on a short leash due to the rigid structure of PoS songs.Which leads me to my criticism of the band. As good as the album is, and as much as complexity can be wonderful, Remedy Lane at times nearly suffocates in its seriousness and complexity. There are times I would really love to hear this band explode into a different kind of jam, looser and free of Daniel's constant lyrical drama. I'm not tanking the album over this because I still like it very much. I just needed to point that out. I'd love to hear these musicians go NUTS without Daniel just a little more.Hermansson and Langell are also veritable forces that raise this band above so many of their peers. The keys and drums are so consistently good you take them for granted after a bit. Very impressive. And then there's Daniel. What can you say? I imagine he's one of those love him or hate him kind of presences for metal fans. You could say that he's too overbearing and keeps this band from reaching where they could if they had more freedom from his epic concepts. On the other hand his songwriting talent is undeniable as is his vocal range, his charisma, and his amazing talent for turning emotion on a dime. He's good mellow, he's good at power, he's good at rage. And he can so smoothly shift gears where lesser singers would have difficulty.It's impossible for me to find enough adjectives to go track by track on this release because there is so much consistency, and thankfully it's uniformly good. If I had to pick one song that knocks me to the floor it might (on this day) be \"Rope Ends\" with its jaw dropping shifting rhythms, piano parts, and guitar. It's a killer. I really look forward to hearing Scarsick and knowing what all the fuss is about. That one seems to divide the fanbase which means it must be interesting. As for this one, there's not much division. Recommended to all PoS fans and prog metal fans without hesitation."

It's a huge prog metal band with a unique style and approach and they have their special place in the subgenre. I also noticed not everybody loves them but that's what you get when you don't play the 13 in a dozen style as we say it over here.I have enormous respect for Daniel Gildenlow both for his vocal performance as for his compositional talent. Yet this Remedy Lane doesn't show his second mentioned talent to full extent I believe. If I compare this work with TPE I feel TPE is the better album. There are quite some \"common\" songs on this one in my opinion. It's simply less special to me despite the presence of Beyond the Pale which is one of their best songs ever.So all in all a very good/excellent album deserving the four stars in the end though rounded up."

          "text": "Pain of Salvation - Remedy Lane 5 starsOne of the most emotional album's ever created in music.The album can bring one to tears if they listen to it during a really depressing point in their life, but I can't help but recommend it, because you will feel at peace in the end. Daniel Gildenlow did almost everything on this album as he wrote the entire concept and lyrics as well as writing all the music except the instrumental in 'Rope Ends' which Fredrik Hermansson gets credit on that. That is quite the feat for an artist to accomplish, especially for a work like this. This supplements my reason to why I consider Daniel Gildenlow to be my musical idol. 'Remedy Lane' and the previous work, 'The Perfect Element' have the same sound in a way compositional wise, just like how 'Entropia' and 'One Hour by the Concrete Lake' had a little bit of a similar compositional style before they moved on.The line-up is still consistent from the 'One Hour.' period. Daniel Gildenlow (Guitars,Vocals), Fredrik Hermansson (Keyboards), Johan Langell (Drums, Vocals), Johan Hallgren (Guitar, Vocals) and Kristoffer Gildenlow (Bass, Vocals)As I mentioned before with the compositional comparison to the previous effort, this album is again broken down into three chapters.Remedy Lane - 'Of Two Beginnings' This is basically just an intro to an album and possibly the greatest intro one could ever hear, with some great lyrics like this 'Now in this hotel room I lie wondering who I am. Never quite as sure after a life of questioning'. Ahhhh the goodness.Chapter 1 - 'Ending Theme', 'Fandango', 'A Trace of Blood', This Heart of Mine (I Pledge' 'Ending Theme' was an interesting piece because it was thrown into the beginning, not really in agreement with the title of the track; it serves a greater purpose though. 'Fandango' is also another strange one, this is some of the weirdest vocal work Daniel has done, Mike Patton was probably proud of this. 'A Trace of Blood' is a tearjerker of a track; it is one of the finest they have done with some rapid changes of mood and an exquisite chorus. 'This Heart of Mine' is another one of those tracks similar to the peaceful ballads of 'The Perfect Element', nothing short of amazing.Chapter 2 - 'Undertow', 'Rope Ends', 'Chain Sling', 'Dryad of the Woods' 'Undertow' is one of the most well known Pain of Salvation tracks, and unlike 'Ashes', good reason. It is a lyrically and vocally driven piece, with the instruments only supplementing the background until the chorus. At the end of the track Daniel is nearly screaming out the lyrics to make it an extremely powerful track. 'Rope Ends' is a poetic track. There are dueling vocals in the chorus except the one in the background is simply read rather then sung. There a pretty nice polyrhythm going on throughout the entire track, it is pretty cool and easy to follow. This track actually helped my fully understand what a polrhythm was. 'Chain Sling' is a strange one, because of the way the verse and chorus is sung. Very hard to describe and I don't think I have the ability to. 'Dryad of the Woods' is one of my favorite instrumental tracks, entire peaceful and very upbeat. Acoustic guitar and grand piano are at the forefront the most; towards the end it is taken in a new direction but keeps the overall tone of the track the same.Chapter 3 - 'Remedy Lane', 'Waking Every God', 'Second Love', 'Beyond The Pale' 'Remedy Lane' is exactly what one should think of. It sums up what the listener has heard so far, except it is all electronica and ambience, very fitting track if you listen to the album all the way through, like you should with any album anyway. 'Waking Every God' and 'Second Love' both are very slow and passionate tracks, they try to end the album but at the same time build up to one of the most powerful closing tracks ever created. 'Beyond the Pale' is a conclusive track that takes a look back on what was covered in the album and puts it into glorious end. The chorus is some of Daniels best work on the microphone, with a crescendo singing 'Someone still this hunger, always growing stronger' that just sounds so epic. Followed by just spoken lyrics, where Daniel is nearly crying saying 'this is not who I wanted to be, this is not what I wanted to see'. 'Beyond the Pale' is a masterpiece of progressive music.Well I just reviewed my two favorite prog-metal albums and I feel quite satisfied. I would once again recommend this to anyone and as a first for anyone to wants to check this band out. The album seems to me, much more accessible and is the one that led my to really dig this band and buy into their discography, something few bands were album to do to me which include as of now and certainly not in the future, Yes, Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Riverside, Mastodon and Canvas Solaris (The bands need to have 3 albums or more). Anyway, this is the most depressing album I have ever heard and I hope my OPINION could be taken seriously. I have heard a couple thousand albums so please take my advice.pick this album up.Even after claiming this to be my favorite prog-metal band.perhaps after 4 years of listening I still have no clear-cut choice as to which my favorite album is between this and 'The Perfect Element'. Depends on my mood I guess, which is why this band works wonders."

          "text": "This is the final album in Pain of Salvation's discography that is, well, typical Pain of Salvation. Following Remedy Lane, the abnormal becomes the normal. But here, they're still playing prog metal with a strong poetic drive to the lyrics and songwriting. And it is with Remedy Lane that they surpass The Perfect Element, Part I.The album opens rather unexpectedly, with the strange construction and the uncomfortable subject matter. If discussions of sexuality (done from a fairly healthy standpoint, at least) bother you, this album is likely not one you should jump into. Of Two Beginnings segues to Ending Theme (marking the strangest labels of two initial tracks on any album I've found yet), a short and straightforward track highlighted by some Gildenlow poetry reading and a nicely zesty guitar solo outro. Fandango enters next, and boy is this one a doozy. A sliding, stuttering bass line, plinking pianos on top, polyrhythmic choruses, dual tone rapping, very high-pitched singing... if you ever want to show a friend what kind of strange things progressive metal has created, this song is the poster child. A Trace of Blood follows, with some upbeat piano in the intro misleading you into thinking this is not a song about his stillborn child. It includes a very touching chorus with great harmonies.This Heart of Mine is one of my personal favorites. Essentially a love song in two parts, the first is a gentle acoustic piece. The second features Daniel singing very passionately and very impressively (if you're one of those people who just loves bombastic and crazy vocals, this might just do it for you). Next, Undertow is a fan favorite, starting slow and building towards a powerful vocal climax. The lyrics are a bit... angsty, though. Rope Ends is quite possibly the weakest song on the album, despite perhaps having the best chorus on the whole CD. In the center of this song, the band randomly degrades from heartbreakingly singing about his ex-wife's attempted suicide to a poorly segued typical prog metal jamfest, complete with shredding and all the typical trappings of the genre that can divide fans so easily. Thankfully, the next track, Chainsling, is much more cohesive and singular. Almost reminiscent of an acoustic Ayreon, it ties together several themes of the album. Dryad of the Woods is a brilliant acoustic instrumental, and it definitely deserves one of the top spots in the Pain of Salvation hierarchy of songs. Very well constructed, very beautiful, not cheesy at all. The title track is just an electronic interlude rehashing some earlier themes.Waking Every God is an enjoyable little rocker, and is perhaps the very last time that Kristoffer Gildenlow slapped the heck out of his bass for a Pain of Salvation song. The intro is just covered with delicious (though undermixed) funky basswork. The rest of the song is solid, too. Second Love is something like This Heart of Mine: a gentle acoustic love song. This time, instead of Daniel singing his heart out, we have two and three part harmonies forming the dark romantic choruses. And that brings us to the final track, Beyond the Pale, a stunning way to end the album. It builds on a bizarre minimalism for the first few minutes, featuring slowly building music and some tortured vocals. The song overall is filled with powerful, soaring, grumpy, and all other sorts of singing, and perhaps is one of Daniel's best moments in front of a microphone--especially the last three words he sings. And this closes the album, save for a slow fadeout and rhythmic poetic whisperings.In short, if you heard The Perfect Element and thought it was great, I hope you try this one out, as it is much stronger and has much less prog metal noodle abuse. This is the band's most consistent release, not as progressively brilliant as their followup, BE, but definitely the best full-band sound they ever achieved. If you're into metal and into prog but are tired of your usual prog metal options, perhaps this is a good place to look."

          "text": "Their previous album The Perfect Element combined fine progressive and metal music: it was my fave amongst of their output so far.When I listened to this album for the first time, I was a bit disappointed. The first trio of songs is rather thin, and one has to wait the very good \"Trace Of Blood\" to discover the first true great song of the album. It owes a lot to \"Dream Theater\" though, but this is not the first time that this relation can be stressed.The rock ballad \"This Heart Of Mine\" is the occasion for Daniel to demonstrate how good a vocalist he is. The classic guitar break to close this song is also well polished (even if very predictable in this genre). The mellowish other one available on this record is much less brilliant (\"Second Love\").This album clearly puts their prog characteristics into brackets and features a heavier angle (\"Undertow\", \"Rope Ends\") and when the band is trying a more acoustic style (\"Chain Sling\" or the instrumental \"Dryad.\") they are not quite convincing.This album has a lot of five and four star ratings (even if only twenty % of the reviews available are commented) but I'm afraid I won't be as generous. Actually, this is my least favourite album from POS so far (you might know that I review a band in the chronological order). Average to my ears. I am downgrading it to two stars because there is really only one outstanding track in here, as far as I am concerned."

          "text": "I have tried very hard to like this album. I think TPE deserves its place at the top of Prog Metal lists, and Remedy Lane often is rated on an equal footing. (Across different sites and boards, this is variable) I obtained both albums at the same time, after having Entropia for several years. At first I thought that maybe my Pain of Salvation circuits had just been overloaded, so I've given it a couple months before trying again. And my opinion has deepened a bit, but in the end my overall feel has not changed. I actually find some of this album unpleasant to listen to. The clean guitar tones on this album are tinny and grating, but moreover, many of the ideas Gildenlow uses on this album just don't work.PoS pushes harder on this album than TPE, and there are indeed some great moments, (Fandango is my favorite). But the vocal delivery is much like a stage show (not that that's unique to this album) and too often melody gets lost in the place of overlong dramatics. Like a classical piece, there are again thematic melodic elements (unimaginatively named Ending Theme here, though I'm sure the authors found that ironic or clever). There are lots of highs and lows, heavy and soft, time changes, but much of it seems too intentional and doesn't flow. I really never get lost in the music itself.The album begins with a section that feels like the start of act two rather than the start of act one, though the song itself (Of Two Beginnings) is strong enough once it gets going. In fact, the whole beginning I would rate as simply good with rough patches but the album heads south midway. Tracks 9-12 are extremely forgetable, most of all the cigarette lighter ballad Second Love. Luckily, the album ends on a high note (Beyond the Pale) where the clucky plucked clean guitars actually make musical sense for the first time, though they still are pretty grating to my ear.Before submitting a review this harsh, I went back one last time and scanned through the tracks, and thought to myself that there really is a lot of good material here. Perhaps it's just an early draft that needed more fine tuning. But in the end, where The Perfect Element continues to pull me in, impress me, and pique my musician's sense, Remedy Lane makes me search for interest, instantly brings out my inner critic, and simply doesn't succeed for me.2.5 stars rounded up."

          "text": "'Remedy Lane' - Pain of Salvation (9/10)One of my all-time favourite records, Pain Of Salvation have crafted a true work worthy of being called a masterpiece. There is a fantastic sense of flow on this album, and the concept (albeit a bit hard to follow) is interesting and emotionally driven. What you get is an incredibly empathetic work, taking you from feelings of Sadness to Fear to Heartbreak and the occasional glimpse of Love and Devotion.Lyrically, 'Remedy Lane' is semi-autobiographical, concerning different, important times in Daniel Gildenlow's (the songwriter and vocalist) life. Much of the content revolves around the apparently torrid lifelong romance between the protagonist and his love. What comes through is a great amount of sincerity, and a sense that Gildenlow truly means and cares about the music he is writting/performing. The feeling is rare to be felt, especially in the progressive metal genre.The music is beautiful, to be blunt. Even the heavier parts such as the highly progressive polyrhythmic 'Rope Ends' emit a vulnerable, lamentable beauty about them.An hour of such a gut wrenching, depressing, and invigorating journey can leave one pressed for tears... A true, beautiful masterpiece, and will always hold a special, relatable place in my heart."

          "text": "Just one year before the release of this album progressive metal masterminds Pain of Salvation released their magnum opus \"The Perfect Element Part 1\". So how do they follow up an incredible album? Make another incredible album. This was my introduction to Pain of Salvation's music, and made me raid their entire discography. This is a great place to start listening to Pain of Salvation music, along with \"The Perfect Element Part 1\".I think the music is slightly stronger on \"The Perfect Element Part 1\", but the concept and story is much stronger here. It's really hard for me to pick which of these two incredible albums I like more. Daniel Gildenlow's songwriting is great, and his unique singing style shines here as well. Daniel Gildenlow may very well be the greatest frontman in modern prog. He even ranks up there with Peter Gabriel and some of the classic performers. One of the few knocks I can give this album is that the bass isn't very prominent, and sometimes I can barely hear it. With that said, there are so many bands in the world where I'll almost want to ask \"Do these guys even have a bassist?!?!\" because the production quality is so bad. Pain of Salvation, luckily, is not one of these bands.Like I said, this was my introduction to Pain of Salvation, and it took a little while to grow on me. The first time I heard it I thought it was just average progressive metal. One day I decided to pull it out again, and I was completely addicted. I think the reason why it needed to grow on me was not because there was anything wrong with the album, but more so that the band is different than anything I've ever heard before. After three or four listens any prog metal fan should like it a lot more than the first listen.With that said, there is not a single flaw on this album. There isn't a moment of filler, which is something that usually cannot be said. The best song is the epic ending \"Beyond the Pale\". It shows the way they beautifully combine dark and heavy sections with light and emotional sections. Some more of my favorites are the experimental \"Fandango\", \"A Trace of Blood\", and the ballad with a wonderful vocal performance \"Second Love\". All I can say is go buy it. You won't be disappointed.5/5 stars"

          "text": "I first encountered this amazing album on the PA right here hailed as one of the greatest prog albums of all time so I had to check it out. I was not disappointed.Daniel Gildenlow is the backbone behind this sprawling saga of a woman who decided she could not take it any more and therefore indulged in the final solution, a walk down 'remedy lane'.The musicianship is excellent throughout from D Gildenlow (Guitars,Vocals), Fredrik Hermansson (Keyboards), Johan Langell (Drums, Vocals), Johan Hallgren (Guitar, Vocals) and K Gildenlow (Bass, Vocals).There are three chapters that unfold the captivating and distressing emotional story.Chapter 1 is comprised of 'Ending Theme', 'Fandango', 'A Trace of Blood', and 'This Heart of Mine (I Pledge)'. This chapter begins with melancholy symphonic styles and then launches into full blown prog metal with the awesome 'Fandango'. This track is my favourite on the album and features some of the most complex out of synch drumming you will hear. It is stunning how the drums are off kilter at times adding to the sense of madness and alienation. The fractured rhythms and metrical patterns are unburdened by lilting, shimmering keyboards and arresting low pitched guitars. The riffing is hypnotic as are the vocals of Gildenlow, that are as bizarre as the lyrics. The other tracks are very solemn, somber ballads that are at times beautifull but cast a shadow of darkness to come.Chapter 2 comprises 'Undertow', 'Rope Ends', 'Chain Sling', and 'Dryad of the Woods'. This is the most haunting chapter beginning with the powerfully executed 'Undertow'. 'Rope Ends' is the most memorable track for me as it features the chilling lyrics about how the lady hung herself with her husband's Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore silk tie. The illustrations in the booklet are unforgettable. The chorus is melodic and very sad echoing the pain of the traumatic female's mind. 'Chain Sling' is a very off kilter track with strange harmonies, and 'Dryad of the Woods' is a wonderful instrumental that slows things down acoustically somewhat to prepare us for chapter 3.Chapter 3 consists of 'Remedy Lane', 'Waking Every God', 'Second Love', and 'Beyond The Pale'. The first track is a veritable summary of all the events thus far. The pace is slowed down with symphonic ambience with 'Waking Every God' and 'Second Love'. One of the best POS tracks is 'Beyond the Pale' that is also the longest on 'Remedy Lane' at almost 10 minutes. This track features heavy metal guitar riffing and time signature changes throughout. It begins with a repetitive estranged pitchy guitar sweep. All is masterfully executed with glorious lead guitar breaks and the awesome vocals of Gildenlow. It finishes the album on a high note amidst all the darkness, like death coming to life.So my first taste of Pain of Salvation has been a pleasurable one, hopefully many more to come. I liked how they structure their music and the songs are not as heavy as other metal prog bands I have heard. They have a quiet patient ambience blended with sharp blasts of metal distortion. The tracks are easy to listen to though the concept was a bit dark and heavy handed for me. I have never been a fan of suicide depression themes as they are obviously downbeat and morbid. However, for pure innovation, this album is certainly worthy of any proggers collection."

          "text": "Pain Of Salvation is yet another top-brand from Sweden, a true marvel in progressive metal, standing out from the pack by their eclectic nature. They steer their music in all sorts of directions, ranging from progressive Gentle Giant adventures to biting Faith No More epics, from melodious guitar leads to System of A Down alternative metal aggression.As such they manage to have power as well as subtlety, originality and intensity. Add their clever catchiness and a wealth of inspiration to that and you got the ultimate recipe to make a peak album in the progressive metal field. Unfortunately, their versatility comes with some weird breaks and modulations that you got to be in the mood for. The chorus ofFandangois such a moment where they come off slightly cheesy to me. But you get used to it over time.Remedy Laneserved as my introduction to Pain of Salvation and for me it shows a band on the brink of a really stunning release. The highlights and creative surprises follow one another in an unrelenting pace, but near the end sit a couple of ballads that sound like leftovers from the previous album. With a more selective approach to their own songwriting it might have been a stronger album.If Pain of Salvation had restrained themselves more they might have crafted a masterpiece here. On the other hand, if restraint would have trimmed their imaginative excessiveness, it would sure have been a lesser album. So I'll accept it as it is and skip the filler bits. A huge musical improvement over the preceding album."

In many ways, they are similar pieces, as they are both very well-produced, with plenty of heavy, gloomy atmospheres, boatloads of masculine harmonies, and a welcome dose of creativity and envelope-pushing.Unlike The Perfect Element, with personal favorites such as Idioglossia, King of Loss and In the Flesh, I can't point to any song on Remedy Lane that really sticks out to my ears. Sure, I enjoy the impassioned poetry of Ending Theme, the restrained beauty of Dryad (with even a melodic reference back to Ashes), and the quite tricky rhythms of Fandango and Rope Ends, but nothing specifically pulls me back to this album.In other words, I don't entirely trust my gut regarding this album in recommending Remedy Lane to others. All I can surely say is that many of the enjoyable Pain of Salvation elements are present, Remedy Lane has never captivated my ears as has The Perfect Element."

Once again, the band's histrionic and melodramatic musical style tips over the borderline into irritating cheesiness for my tastes, and the album's concept seems just as irritating preachy as One Hour By the Concrete Lake or Entropia. The studio production is impeccable, but to me that's part of the problem - the band seem to be more interested in trying out all the studio tricks they are in the simple skill of writing a good tune. Frankly, this seems to be the problem with many prog bands - they're so dedicated to being progger-than-thou that they neglect more basic skills of the rock musician's craft, to their detriment."

          "text": "This is the fourth album by Swedish prog metallers Pain Of Salvation and although it is again a concept album, it is not a follow-up to 'The Perfect Element Part 1'. The band has decided not to work on a sequel just yet, although that is in place for the future. POS have been working with the usual suspects in the past, having toured with both Threshold and Arena while band leader Danny Gildenl\ufffdw also found himself playing with Transatlantic. They have also confirmed dates with Dream Theater in the near future. Danny describes the album himself as follows \"If you're looking for a band that sounds like your favourite group, forget about us. But if you happen to be looking for a band that lets you forget your favourite group, take a few walks down Remedy Lane and you'll find that you're not the same person that you were before\".The album is about failed relationships and the role of a person's past when entering into a relationship. At times the music is very heavy, at others very light, but there is a constant tension between the two, so that the listener is never quite sure what is going to happen next. The vocals also take on an important aspect as they move between rock screams and almost spoken passages, while at all times maintaining a certain menace.While there are no really long tracks (closer \"Beyond The Pale\" is the longest at less than ten minutes), the proghead cannot feel hard done by as there is plenty of complexity and intricacy to get their head into. Again an intriguing album from Pain Of Salvation that may be too heavy for the proghead while being too complex for those into metal, but it is rewarding for those who follow the path to the end.Originally appeared in Feedback #67, Apr 02"

          "text": "Having read about this album I was really excited when I put it on for the first time. It did not sound the way I had imagined but that's alright. Prog albums rarely do. Isn't that the whole idea of prog, not sounding like anything you'd expect? Well, turned out to be a hard one to review. Really it is. I am no stranger to heavy metal, I was sort of raised on it. It is not that. It is rather the fact that Gildenl\ufffdw is extremely talented, obviously, but I do not agree with his musical vision wholeheartedly.I will say this, the music found on Remedy lane really is a real concoction of styles. It is though Gildenl\ufffdw has gathered together everything (or nearly) from the commercial side of hard rock to the more extreme, almost death-y, metal. That is a feat and as such I applaud him. But do I think it is a success? Well, maybe not in my book and maybe not to the full extent intended. I cannot embrace the album as muych as I'd like to. The ambition and talent is unquestioned but I am simply not that enchanted. And in that lies the difficulty.There are tracks I really enjoy. The trio of \"Rope ends\", \"Chain sling\" and \"Dryad of the woods\" are very enjoyable indeed. The folky side of \"Dryad...\" is quite beautiful and \"Rope ends\" is certainly a multifacetetted piece of music, well worth exploring.I do not suggest that the other tracks aren't enjoyable, as a whole or in bits, but there are elements I disagree with. There is a side of this album that makes me uneasy and not in a good way. It is hard to describe but I hear elements of music I quiver about, like contemporary pop-metal of sorts. Since I cannot digest those bits I find it hard to love this album. It is a good album, a brilliant one if I was to clear the plate from all those elements I find hard to swallow.All in all, Remedy lane is a good album. Full of talent and intent. It just don't agree with me. Sorry."

          "text": "Review N\ufffd 24Pain Of Salvation is a Swedish progressive metal group founded in 1991. The lyrics show deep concerns told through elaborate concept albums and the music is just all over the place. In a five minutes song, it's quite common for Pain Of Salvation go to different tempos, time signatures and musical atmospheres, changing from powerful aggressive parts to sweet and gentle melodies.'Remedy Lane' is their fourth studio album and was released in 2002. It was almost entirely written during a two month period, from August to September 2001 by Daniel Gildenlow, and was recorded in autumn 2001 and released in spring 2002. The album was produced and mastered by Daniel, Anders 'Theo' Theander and Pain Of Salvation, and the Graphic Art and Multimedia was made by Daniel and Entropia Productions.The line up on the album is Daniel Gildenlow (lead vocals and guitar), Johan Hallgreen (backing vocals and guitar), Fredrik Hermansson (keyboards and synthesizers), Kristoffer Gildenlow (backing vocals, bass guitar and cello), and Johan Langell (backing vocals, drums and percussion).'Remedy Lane' has thirteen tracks. The concept and the lyrics are all written by Daniel. All the music was also written by him, except 'Rope Ends' which was written by Daniel and Fredrik. The thirteen tracks are divided into an introduction and three chapters. The first track 'Of Two Beginnings' is the opening track and is a kind of an introduction to the album. The second track 'Ending Theme', the third track 'Fandango', the fourth track 'A Trace Of Blood' and the fifth track 'This Heart Of Mine (I Pledge)', makes part of Chapter 1. The sixth track 'Undertow', the seventh track 'Rope Ends', the eighth track 'Chain Sling' and the ninth track 'Dryad Of The Woods', makes part of Chapter 2. The tenth track 'Remedy Lane', the eleventh track 'Waking Every God', the twelfth track 'Second Love' and the thirteenth track 'Beyond The Pale', makes part of Chapter 3.As Daniel explains, the meaning of the album title 'Remedy Lane', is about an English expression 'Take A Walk Down Memory Lane', which means, to visit your past or going to a nostalgic trip. For him, that is what happened with this concept album, which is the need to reconcile ourselves with the past, to find remedy for our personal crisis.'Remedy Lane' is a concept album, focusing on the search of a man to discover himself. It's also about love, sex, a crisis in a relationship and the interactions with other people. The story of the concept takes place in Hungary, in different places, where the songs take us. This album is a part autobiographical and a part fictional of a period of Daniel's personal life, and as he said, it's his most Pain Of Salvation personal album.'Remedy Lane' is a superiorly recorded and released album, what is usual with all Pain Of Salvation albums. It has an excellent conceptual cohesion, which brings originality and diversity to the metal progressive sub-genre and in my humble opinion it represents the band's finest musical creation, until now. Musically, this album really goes all over the place and lives up to its progressive reputation. The song structures are wild and complex in their dissonance and the instruments are performed with technical ease, and the vocals of the singer and guitarist Daniel Gildenlow range from passionate to absolutely insane. The songs themselves are also packed with a good deal of variety and range and portray the stories of the lyrics well and offer something for just about any kind of listener.Just one more thing! I'll leave you with the Daniel's main reason to like or dislike of Pain Of Salvation, particularly of this album. And I'm going to cite him: 'If you are looking for a band that sounds just like your favourite band, just forget about us. If you are looking for a band that will make you forget about your favourite band, we are there, just walk down Remedy Lane and you will never be the same'.Conclusion: I met Pain Of Salvation by Progarchives, and 'Remedy Lane' was my first encounter with their music. I read that the group had an excellent reputation, but the real truth is that I wasn't really prepared for listen something like this, an incredible and beautiful album. Although, being not a specialist on progressive metal, one of my favourite bands is Dream Theater, I oddly missed the Pain Of Salvation phenomenon until now and I do regret it, sincerely. As you can see, 'Remedy Lane' is a very special album for me, because is so unique, so pure and so authentic. So, for those who don't met yet Pain Of Salvation, and after reading the Daniel's citation and be still interested on the band, I suggest begin with this masterpiece, despite their live album '12:05', be certainly more accessible. Surely this is an album that appeals to fans of Dream Theater and Opeth, or to everyone with a taste for something new and different.Prog is my Ferrari. Jem Godfrey (Frost*)"

Remedy Lane is melancholic and dark sometimes, but also shows a more romantic and sentimental side of the the band (or Gildenlow). For this very reason, I think it is also more accessible while maintaining all the elements that made this band so great back then, marking the peak Pain of Salvation's career.The production is crystal clear, especially the incredible vocals mix from Gildenlow who has in absolute top form here (producing also the album together with Anders Theander), and everything sounds just perfect. The concept of the album is autobiographical and very touching, giving the best lyrics of the whole band's career in my opinion, and as I said, this is one of the few prog-metal album that is instantly accessible (This Heart of Mine, Waking Every God) and very complex (Fandango, Rope Ends) at the same time.Best Tracks: Of Two Beginnings, Ending Theme, Fandango, A Trace of Blood, Undertow, Chain Sling, Second Love... There is no weak moment to be found here. Really!Conclusion: Remedy Lane marked the creative peak of Pain of Salvation in my opinion, being of the best prog-metal albums of the last decade. Intricate but accessible, dark and romantic, soft and fierce, and with a beautiful lyrical concept which deserves to be delighted slowly and many, many times.Sadly, after this masterpiece nothing would be the same for Pain of Salvation again.My rating: *****"

          "text": "If there is one album within progressive metal that truly moves me it is Remedy Lane, and if there is one band that is most genuine in their lyrical content and sound it is Pain Of Salvation. We find in this album complexity in structure, and skill in musicianship, that will made a seasoned musician blush. The lyrics may make you blush too if you play this in public to an average non-prog fan, without the right mood or context, so be aware of that too! haha. Remedy Lane tackles concepts such as the dangers and ecstasy of sexual exploration, in this case younger than the protagonist is ready for, depression in the face of true life struggles anyone can relate to, fear of becoming a parent and what that will require, the tragedy of life when it is stripped away from you, the grief that comes with the resentment of a lost unborn child, the rage and confusion that comes from the inability to place blame for such an event on anyone, the choice to point a finger to ones' self in hindsight for such an tragedy, loss of all will to live, trying to protect our loved ones from their own internal pain, and finding the will to move on from all of it.Yeah, this isn't your average progressive metal album filled with songs of fairies, monsters, demons, and magic. This is much much scarier and much more substantial. These song talk of real life circumstances real people have dealt with, or may deal with at one time or another, or at least someone you may know or have seen walking along the street may have experienced in their life. This music is heartbreaking to say the least. Pain Of Salvation weaves these stories with incredibly high levels of musicianship coming from all band members (the drummer in particular is just one of the best to come from the progressive metal scene, period) and a vocalist that is the feature of the band for good reason. This guy Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw has a voice that is almost inhuman in its' range and versatility. He's basically progressive metals equivalent of Freddie Mercury from Queen. He might even be better than Freddie Mercury in some ways. Yes, i mean it, and i realize that Freddie Mercury is known as one of the greatest voices to ever grace rock music as a whole.If you enjoy progressive rock, or progressive metal at all, you must give this album a chance. This and 'Perfect Element Pt. 1' are pinnacles of the progressive metal genre, and of all of progressive music of any genre. I like this one a bit better, but to each their own, and both are landmarks of prog. This is a concept album without any of the pretentiousness, or over long drawn out jamming that so many concept albums fall prey to."

          "text": "Pain of Salvation is back with another highly acclaimed release of theatric power prog.1. Of Two Beginnings\" (2:24) gets one excited for that which could follow! (8.75/10)- Chapter 1 2. \"Ending Theme\" (4:59) great chords and melody possibilities in the opening. Things slow down and drop away for the singing of the first two verses. Very sensitive and delicate; I was not expecting this! At 2:15, with the busting out of the chorus, we finally get the full feeling I was expecting, but then the overly dramatic \"film narration\" within the music . Nice keyboard and guitar interplay in the fourth minute's instrumental section. When Daniel returns singing in his upper register, it's pretty powerful--and then the guitar is unleashed (al little) for the finish. Great potential but too much is held back, held in check. (8.75/10)3. \"Fandango (5:51) frenetic guitar play opens this one before keys and second guitar join. The sinister Joker-like vocal has a Ozzy, Anthony Keidis, or Michael Sadler quality and style to it. (8.75/10)4. \"A Trace Of Blood\" (8:17) part Fish-era MARILLION, part RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, and part GUNS 'N' ROSES. (17.75/20)5. \"This Heart Of Mine (I Pledge)\" (4:01) a tender love song that could almost have come from MINNIE RIPPERTON, BENNY MARDONES, or SEAL. Gorgeous and heart-felt! (9.5/10) - Chapter 26. \"Undertow\" (4:47) Almost a Post Rock construct as it rises slowly, building to a crescendo. The highlight for me is the shift into fullness at 2:22 and again at 3:33. (9.5/10)7. \"Rope Ends\" (7:02) syncopated staccato riffs of tightly coordinated guitar, bass, and bass drum are joined by keyboard washes and cymbal play before multi-voiced lead come in to sing. The white bread chorus is a bit of a let down. Weird piano-based jazzy psych-pop funk section begins at 3:50 in order to support soloing. Overall, I'm just not a fan. (12.25/15)8. \"Chain Sling\" (3:58) using a kind of balalaika effect on the lead guitar riff that repeats ad infinitum in this song, Daniel sings a fast paced, almost-continuous vocal which, to a deaf-to-lyrics kind of guy like me, only serves to hammer home the boring tedium of the melodic loop. (8/10)9. \"Dryad Of The Woods\" (4:56) more interesting finger-picked electric guitar work. (Why doesn't he just use a classical guitar?) He's no Jan Akkerman. After 90 seconds piano, bass, and drums join in. From there, this instrumental borders on New Age GOBI-like stuff. Such an incongruous song among the others (but, then, so were \"Chain Sling\" and \"Fandango\"). This leads me further from supporting any claim (or theory) that this is a concept album. (7.5/10)- Chapter 3 10. \"Remedy Lane\" (2:15) synths & percussion that remind me of a combination of The Who's \"Baba O'Reilly\" and Pink Floyd's Dragon Toms intro to \"Time\" run through a flange/chorus effects box to provide an interesting, if dated, futuristic soundscape. (4.25/5)11. \"Waking Every God\" (5:19) Weird synth piano opening that is quickly joined by abrasive guitars and jazzy bass. Quite an odd and incongruous selection of instruments! Weak, almost vocals enter feeling as if the engineer and producer were unsure whether or not to include them in the song! (8.5/10)12. \"Second Love\" (4:21) finally: an acoustic guitar! Opening with an almost BON JOVI- or POISON-like ballad feel, there is some nice lead guitar play in the third minute over the piano, but, overall, this is just an 80s power ballad. (8.25/10)13. \"Beyond The Pale\" (9:56) Probably the best/my favorite Pain of Salvation epic-length song I've ever heard. There are parts (at the beginning) that drag, and the vocal stylings once again sound very familiar, but there are just some great textures here and an overall flow and construct that is pretty awesome. (18.5/20)Total time 68:06The band might have a little more of a consistent vision of what it is they are trying to say on this album--both musically and ideologically--and the music feels a little smoother (and less creative) and the singing more staccato- rap-influenced (less creative) than their previous effort, The Perfect Element - Part 1. The music here reminds me more of bands like Fish-era MARILLION, ANGE, SAGA, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, and GUNS 'N' ROSES than their previous album and just feels less creative and innovative than Perfect Element. Also, the music of the song constructs are remarkably simple--which leads me to my final comment/question (which is the same as with my review of The Perfect Element): Is this really Prog Metal?B/four stars; an excellent addition of prog metal-lite to any prog lover's music collection."

          "text": "Swedish prog metal pioneers Pain of Salvation released their fourth studio album 'Remedy Lane' in January of 2002 through Inside Out Music, after gaining momentum with three very well received records that presented something entirely different to the progressive music scene - an innovative approach that incorporated a variety of styles and techniques not yet heard as well as a taste for the dramatic, cerebral and thoughtful lyrical presentation, wrapping everything into the sophisticated shell of the concept album; Pain of Salvation might have been seen as a prog band that is not necessarily explicitly prog but an intriguing collective of very talented musicians that were gradually forging an identity of their own, a severely original and a movingly memorable one.'Remedy Lane' is a concept album that deals with the narrator's search for self-discovery, while touching upon themes like love, sexuality, loss, anger, and suicide - surely a darker prog album that surprisingly or not, contains uplifting and inspiring moments, whether they be through the instrumental prowess the listener is exposed to, the touching lyrics or the unpredictable twists of the songs. Thematically strong, lyrically intriguing, and musically astonishing, we have to say that 'Remedy Lane' impresses as much as it surprises through its unusual songcraft, gently balancing aggression and feel. With all this in mind, it might be needless to say that 'Remedy Lane' contains a lot of masterful and involving compositions from the band, many of which are still played live by them and beloved by their fans.It is all the twists and turns, all the interplay between the musicians, all the heartfelt episodes of ingenious heavy music, incredibly well-conceived and well-performed, that make 'Remedy Lane' ever so special. It is an album that necessitates the listener to experience it and to allow himself to be engulfed by its atmosphere. Perhaps in some sort of divine inspiration, Pain of Salvation had composed a contemporary metal opera that shall forever be remembered for its originality, daring, yet provocative nature, myriad of memorable sounds, and acutely inevitable emotional reaction by the listener."

          "text": "Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "name": "PAIN OF SALVATION",
      "genre": "Progressive Metal",
      "country": "Sweden",
      "biography": "Founded in  Eskilstuna, Sweden in 1984 (as \"Reality\") - Changed name in 1991 - Still active as of 2017\n\nPain of Salvation is widely known as one of the fundamental progressive metal bands from the second generation, which came around the mid 90's, but the fact is that the band is one of the oldest progressive metal bands still active. The band was formed by guitarist, singer and composer Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw and friends in 1984, two years after Fates Warning, Three years after Queensr\ufffdche and a year before Dream Theater, when Daniel was only 11 years old. At that time, the band was called Reality, but as Daniel got older he realized the band's name needed to changed, despite the band being basically the same. So, in 1991 the band officially changed from Reality to Pain of Salvation. Daniel, over the years, gave various different reasons for the change of name, but the common feature of all those explanations is the fact that the name symbolizes the balance between things of vital significance, such as good and bad, light and dark, life and death.\n\nThe band had numerous personnel changes, mostly during the Reality period and the early period of Pain of Salvation up until their second album. Since the release of One Hour by the Concrete Lake the band remained fairly stable, with only two important band member changes: when Kristoffer Gildenl\ufffdw, Daniel's brother, left in 2006 due to being unable to attend to rehearsals because he lived in Denmark, and when Johan Langell, Pain of Salvation's drummer since 1989, left in 2007 in order to focus on his own family.\n\nAfter having a reasonably stable lineup for some time, Pain of Salvation decided, in 1996, to search for a record deal with some record label, but first recruited the keyboardist Fredrik Hermansson to complete the band's intended sound. During the rest of 1996 they distributed various demo tapes in hope to get signed with any interesting label. In early 1997 the band started recording their debut album in Roasting House, a professional recording studio in Sweden, and in August of the same year Entropia was released in Asia by Avalon, a Japanese record label owned by the Japanese record company Marquee, with generally positive response feedback, eventually leading to another licensing deal, this time with Romanian label SC Rocris Discs still in late 1997.\n\nEntropia can be easily considered as the band's most musically diverse release up to today, raging from mellow passages to crushingly heavy ones, from complex Gentle Giant influenced songs to funky / black music influenced songs, from thoughtful and calm passages to distressful and energetic passages. Unlike posterior releases, however, Entropia does not focus on one theme or one storyline, having three stories being developed at the same time in the album.\n\nAt the time of Entropia's release, the band started to gain international attention, but nothing like what they experienced after the release of One Hour by the Concrete Lake, in 1998. The album had an ever bigger acclaim and had an even bigger positive reception than the band's debut album, receiving media coverage from specialized magazines all around the world and was considered as a darker Entropia. This album sparkled the attention of InsideOut, one of the major progressive music labels, to sign with the band between late 98 and early 99. As a result to that, the band's previous works were rereleased in Europe and USA in 1999. InsideOut still is Pain of Salvation's recording label to this day.\n\nDespite being considered a masterpiece at the time, Gildenl\ufffdw sees One Hour by the Concrete Lake today as one of the band's least accomplishing albums, musically speaking, and it is not hard to understand why: though being a great piece of progressive metal, One Hour by the Concrete Lake's music is more homogeneous / is not such a melting pot of influences as the other Pain of Salvation's albums.\n\nAfter a short break, the band recorded and released in the year 2000 the album The Perfect Element, part I. The album received a huge amount of praise from both the media and the fans all around the world.\n\nThe Perfect Element, part I showed the darkest side of the band yet, both musically and lyrically. The album had themes such as psychological and physical abuse during the childhood and adolescence, sexuality, drug abuse, love, pain, anger, loss, despair and shame, for example, and the various consequences and correlations those things had with the forming of a person. The music also goes with said themes and unveil and even darker side than the one showed in Concrete Lake, making The Perfect Element, part I one of the most dense progressive metal releases to date.\n\nStill in 2000, the band toured on Europe in support of its album during September and October with neo-prog supergroup Arena. In February 2001, the band traveled for the first time to the USA to play in the ProgPower USA festival, as headliners and in late 2001 the band entered the studio once more to record Remedy Lane. Remedy Lane is Pain of Salvation's fourth album and was released in January 2002, being received very well by the progressive rock and progressive metal community and being regarded as the band's best work so far. Still in 2002, during the Remedy Lane tour, the band was invited by Dream Theater to be a special guest opener for their European tour of the album Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\n\nRemedy Lane is, along with all Pain of Salvation's albums, a concept album, but, unlike the other albums released by the band so far, the concept of Remedy Lane was both lighter (when compared with the other themes used in previous albums) and closer to the audience, since it treated about more earthly matters than previous albums (lost love, lust, the emotional feelings one may feel, human relationship, etc). The album is part autobiographical, because Daniel based the story of the album on an actual relationship he had.\n\nA year after the release of Remedy Lane, in 2003, Pain of Salvation recorded a special acoustic concert for a crowd of special guests, which was released as the live album 12:5. That album was supposed to be more than a simply \"Unplugged\" album: all songs played, despite being inspired in actual Pain of Salvation songs, were actually re-interpretations or completely new songs that were based solely on few parts of the original song.\n\nAfter the end of the Remedy lane tour, the band spent most of 2003 and 2004 working on their most ambitious project so far: a concept album which treats about the nature of existence of God and humankind and how one influences the other. That project would later become the band's 2004 album BE. The idea itself dates back to 1996 and Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw worked on the subject from time to time, but nothing serious or final was done until the period the band started to work on the concept, in the early 2000's.\n\nBefore being recorded, the material that would be in the album was performed in Eskilstuna a number of times in its entirety with costumes, stage props, screen projections and orchestra (the nine-part orchestra called The Orchestra of Eternity). After those performances, the concept and the music was further adjusted and refined and in February 2004 the band begun recording what would be known as the album BE.\n\nBE was released in September 2004 and was the first album to divide the band's audience. That happened for a number of reasons: some fans felt the album was way too ambitious and was borderline incomprehensible, wile others felt the album lacked the progressive metal the band was so known for and entered too deep in the progressive rock field; others, mostly new fans that came from a progressive rock background that was attracted by the album's \"revolutionary sound, considered it the Pain of Salvation's best album yet.\n\nIndeed, BE is very different from every other album in the band's catalogue, musically speaking. In that album, Pain of Salvation drops, for the most part, their progressive metal elements and deliver a very refined and complex progressive rock piece, which included the nine-part orchestra (The Orchestra of Eternity), along with an incredibly complex and intertwined concept which was presented and developed in a very small and limited amount of time, making both the music and the concept appear too dense for some as well as they appeared to be too lightly developed for others.\n\nBE also featured the so-called \"God's Answering Machine in the song Vocari Dei, which consisted in a place where band fans would leave a message for God. People from around the world sent their messages for the Machine and the band used the material as part of the song, together with an instrumental piece. The joint instrumental music and the pleads to God created one of the most emotional songs the band has ever come up with so far.\n\nStill in 2004, the band started its \"embargo\" on the USA due to the policy of fingerprinting all out of country visitors and due to the contempt for the Bush administration, for the part of Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw. The \"embargo\" was actually motivated by the fact that George W. Bush was the president of the USA, since, after Barrack Obama became the president the \"embargo\" was lifted, despite the fingerprinting policy still existing.\n\nRoughly a year before the release of Scarsick, Daniel's brother, Kristoffer Gildenl\ufffdw, was asked to leave the band because he was unable to attend to the rehearsals. Since he was living in the Netherlands at that point and the rest of the band lived in Sweden, it was only natural that he could not go to rehearsals. After leaving the band, Kristoffer have been working on his own musical projects, being the 2007 album Synchronized, from the band Dial, the first to come to surface.\n\nThree years after the release of BE, Pain of Salvation released their sixth album, Scarsick. This album is rather an unique on for the band for two reasons: first, it escapes the pattern of the modern band's sound (which would be characterized by the albums BE and Road Salt), which is heavily influenced by the 1970's rock music (progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, specially). Scarsick, for its turn, gets most of its base sound from the late 1990's and early 2000's new metal, a genre that, by the time the album was released, was already old news and endured a rather heavy amount of negative feedback. Second, the album is mostly song-and-band oriented, something that the band has never (fully) done before, though Entropia go through those places quite a few times. Naturally, the album met mixed reviews since it was released and still does over the years.\n\nAccording to Daniel, Scarsick is the second part of the three-piece concept \"The Perfect Element\". The second presentation of the concept is entitled \"he\" and continues the story of the male character introduced on The perfect Element, Part I. Sacarsick has also different subjects and approaches from the first part of the concept. The latter deals with dysfunctions and psychological problems of the individual, wile the former deals with political and social problems.\n\nThrough the following years, the band would tour in support of their album, both inside and outside Europe. During this tour, their second live album and live DVD was recorded in one of their gigs, in Amsterdam. That was quite a courageous move, knowing that the album they were supporting on that same tour have had so many mixed feedback.\n\nStill during their touring, in 2007, it was announced that long time drummer, Johan Langell would leave the band in order to focus to be able to focus on his family. In spite of that, he would remain in the band until the rest of the tour and until all drummer parts were teached to his replacement, which would be the French drummer Leo Margarit. In 2008, yet another line-up change happened. The bassist Simon Andersson, Kristoffer replacement, left the band. Since then, the band has used bassist player Per Schelander as a touring member.\n\nThe year of 2009 was a rather bad year of Pain of Salvation. Two major projects have to be canceled due to the bankruptcy of SPV, the owner of the band's record label InsideOut: the Progressive Nation 2009 tour, with Dream Theater and Beardfish, was canceled because of the sheer lack of funds. The PN 2009 would be the band's first time in the USA since the \"embargo\" started, back in 2004. Also, the release of the album Road Salt had to be postponed, also because of the bankruptcy of SPV. Although the band was unable to release the album, Daniel Gildenl\ufffdw stated, on an internet interview, that he had more time to work and mature the album, the songs and the concept with that \"extra time\" gained. With that \"extra time\" he also decided to release each part of the Road Salt album separately, with a timeframe of a year separating them.\n\nDespite those two heavy hits, the band managed to take something positive out of the situation. First, Pain of Salvation was the supporting act on the Dream Theater tour through Australia, the first time the band has ever set foot on the country. In the second place, they managed to release an EP, after Century Media got its hands on InsideOut, which would be some kind of preview to the Road Salt album. Thirdly, they were classified to the Melodiefestivalen 2010, the Swedish leg of the Eurovision Music Contest of the same year, with the title track of the Road Salt album. That gave Pain of Salvation the biggest ever exposure to the Swedish public in their career.. They were disqualified on the Andra Chancen, however, and did not took part on the Eurovision.\n\nOn mid 2010, the first part of their newest album, Road Salt I: Ivory, was released. The album brought back the \"rock\" side of Pain of Salvation, previously seen on BE, back to the surface. Heavily influenced by the 70's, even more than BE, the band did everything they could to make the album sound as close as if it was recorded 40 years ago, even under producing themselves and muddying their sound / making it less clear.\n\nThe second part of the album, Road Slat II: Ebony, is planned to be released on the first part of 2011.\n\n(Thanks to CCVP for the bio)\n\nSee also:\n\n-\n\nDial\n\n-\n\nFor All We Know\n\n-\n\nThe Shadow Theory",

          "text": "Approximately 20 years ago a postman made a delivery to my house. In itself there is nothing unusual in that concept, but the difference here was that inside the envelope was a demo tape from a Dorset band. They had been given my details by Stu Nicholson who I had recently been in contact with, so they decided to send me the tape to see what I thought of it. Needless to say that band were Big Big Train, and the tape was 'From The River To The Sea', and it was the first piece of music ever sent to me to review. Since then I have listened to countless thousands of CDs, but Big Big Train were the very first so I have always had something of a soft spot for them. Although it must be said that not only was I not a huge fan of one of their releases back in the day, but I also had the misfortune to run into Greg Spawton in a pub in Winchester not long after I had formed that opinion.The reason for that was I felt that they no longer sounded like BBT and that they had allowed outside guests and influences to take over the album, but looking back now it is obvious that it was an important step in allowing the band to grow musically. And boy have they changed now. There have been one or two line-up changes over the years but Greg (now on bass/keys) and Andy Poole (keys/production) have been there from the beginning, and singer David Longdon (plus mandolin, keys, flute etc) who joined in 2009 has been a real find. It is these three that have written all of the songs, but since 2010 they have been joined by guitarist Dave Gregory and some drummer called Nick D'Virgilio. Yes, the ex-Spock's Beard and current Mystery sticksman is also a key member of this band.So when my copy turned up from the band the other day you can guess how excited I was. One word screams out all of the time that this is playing, and that is \"Maturity\". The band have changed immensely since those early days and have produced an album that is huge and the reason for that is the control that pervades everything that is happening. I was playing this while out in one of the paddocks and I was trying to think who it reminded me of, and the closest I can come to is Marillion combined with Chris Rea but that has much more to do with the way they have approached the construction and composition as opposed to the musical direction.Many people will say that this isn't a prog album, but so what? That really depends on your personal definition of prog, but given the use of additional guests and instruments where else doe sit really fit? On a personal level, when I heard the flute I immediately asked myself if Martin Orford (IQ/Jadis) had become involved in the music scene again as I know that he had contributed to past BBT albums. Well, I was wrong about the flute as that is by David but Widge does provide some backing vocals - it was a huge loss to not only UK prog but to music as a whole when he decided not to continue so hopefully there will be more to come.This is a part one album, with the second to follow in March, and to be honest I can hardly wait. To my old jaded ears this is stunning ? and when I received that cassette all those years ago I could never have imagined that one day I would be listening to anything as powerful as this. This is essential for any lover of good music. www.bigbigtrain.com(This review was sourced from a pre release copy provided by the band - ADMIN EDIT)"

          "text": "Without a doubt Dave Longdon is the new shining star of modern progressive rock; his vocal, composition, and flute contributions to Big Big Train have taken this band to a whole new level, a level that may imprint BBT into the Prog Hall of Fame--one of the few modern bands to achieve a standing right among the masters of the 1970s. Also, while I was not convinced of Dave Gregory's 'fitting in' based upon his previous BBT contributions, on this album everything, everybody is clicking. Amazing song compositions with fresh and diverse stylistic presentations topped by the amazing--did I say \"amazing\"? I meant, \"incomparable\"- -vocals of Dave Longdon. And this time the lyrics and vocal passion fit with the music. I LOVE these lyrics. Everything component of every song seems woven into a magical tapestry worthy of adorning the walls of kings! With The Underfall Yard we saw a lot of glimpses but not everything with the \"newcomers\" (D'Virgilio, Gregory, and Longdon) had gelled yet.\"The First Rebreather\" (10/10) is an amazing opener which reminds me of the way \"Dance on a Volcano\" or \"A Musical Box\" opened their respective albums, the former for Nick D'Virgilio's display of Phil Collins-like drumming (Phil at his absolute best) and the latter for the changing dynamics and essential individual contributions to the whole-group masterpiece. Amazing story, lyrics and singing! Wonderful weaving of al the instrumentalists AND the vocal arrangements. A perfect song! (though the nod to GENESIS is quite obvious.)\"Uncle Jack\" (9/10) Off-beat like a STEVE HACKETT song (or, a little bit like \"I Know What I Like [In Your Wardrobe]\"), this is, to me, refreshing for its celebration of an average Joe (again like \"I Know What I Like\"). I bit like a carry over from The Underfall Yard, but still a mature, masterful blend of everyone's talents. Plus, banjo!\"Winchester from St. Giles' Hill\" (11/10) was my instant favorite. Now I can't decide between it and all of the other 10s! A beautiful song from it's opening notes and accompaniment. Incredible vocal melodies and vocal arrangements. I love Dave Gregory's jazzy (almost PAUL WELLER-like) guitar. Amazing chorus. WOW! What power and feeling! Then to soften with those guitar strums and mellotron. The bass playing just kills me. This is a funky jazzed up prog MASTERPIECE! And then the MICHEL LE GRAND/JEAN-PIERRE RAMPAL almost- classical section in the middle! Followed by an awesome guitar solo which brings us back first to the funk rhythm and then to the AMAZING story, vocal, vocal arrangement. I'm undone! TOO beautiful for words . . .***** Each year I give a 11 our of 10 rating and this, ladies and gentlement, is that song.; the one song that transcends my expectations for the potential for human creativity.\"Judas Unrepentant\" (8/10) unfortunately begins with a bit of a Genesis \"Illegal Alien\" feel to it. Luckily the chorus and bridges diverge quite a bit. The mellow, almost classical section beginning at the 3:30 mark is a welcome, even masterful, diversion. When the main song theme returns it with a wonderful symphonic crescendo of sound. Nice little organ solo to cover the return to the original \"Alien\" beat/sound. An light, upbeat, fast-paced yet somehow heavy and complex song. Fascinating!\"Summoned by Bells\" (9/10) begins with a pretty Tony Banks/Anthony Phillips piano arpeggio before establishing itself as something else, quite, with cello, doo-wap b-vox, recorders, and even the kitchen sink thrown in. (Just kidding!) Have I mentioned how noticeable and creative--even melodic--is the bass work on this album? Wonderful. And replete with so many unexpected flourishes and techniques. And NIck D'Virgilio really makes his mastery known without going over the top or without having to be mixed too forward in the production mix. This song provides a perfect example of how Dave Gregory's guitar work fits perfectly whereas on previous albums it may not have worked, may even have stood out a bit too much. On this one every strum, arpeggio and strum fits perfectly. Absolutely stunned and LOVE the delicate, emotional outro with its gorgeous horns and heart-wrenching Fripp-like guitar solo.\"Upton Hill\" (9/10) reminds me of a perfect PREFAB SPROUT or DREAM ACADEMY song-- quirky yet drop-dead gorgeous. Prominently featured flute, cello, accordian, female b-vox and banjo help provide this one with its own unique feel.The first 1:36 of \"A Boy in Darkness\" (10/10) has a very KATE BUSH and TEARS FOR FEARS feel to it. Until the very TEARS FOR FEARS breakout at 1:36. Later, the almost jazzy top-speed instrumental section in the middle is filled with great drumming, great guitar, flute, strings, percussives, and organ is one of the highlights of the album. Breathtakeing. And then the segue back into the vocal sections is so masterful. Absolutely brilliant! Fripp guitar soloing beneath Longdon's powerful singing. The final minute is a crescendo of power and emotion with Gregory and D'Virgilio leading the way. Love the oscillating organ to-fade.\"Hedgerow\" (10/10) has an amazing XTC/BYRDS/ANT PHILLIPS/BEATLES feel, musically (thanks, Dave Gregory!), topped with some jaw-droppingly astounding vocal arrangements. Slow guitar arpeggios over which a solo viola/violin dirges propels the song into emotional depths of amazing proportions. Top this off with Nick D'Virgilio's stupendous drumming and you have the best crossover prog song of the year. The lyrics are the coup de grace?they bring me to my knees! I am not worthy! Especially the repeating flower names sung by the background singers! What an end to an amazing album?an album of a quality and consistency that I thought I'd never hear! Move aside Echolyn, Marillion, Astra, TFK, and even Anglagard.Hail! to the new kings of the hill!Congratulations Andy and Greg: Your passion, vision, and perseverance has paid off! This is the best music album I've heard from 2012. It may be (dare I say or even think it?) a perfect album. So many, many times as I listen to this album am I just astounded at the instrumental, compositional, incidental and lead sound, and textural shifts that occur--and frequently-- within each song?not to mention the unparalleled vocal arrangements. (I beg of you: Has ANY album EVER put forth such astounding vocal arrangements??) These five gentlemen are truly master music craftsmen. No: Master music artisans. This album is, to me, akin to a Sistine Chapel, a Taj Mahal, a Monet, a Beethoven's 9th."

          "text": "This is the second album by this particular Big Big Train lineup after The Underfall Yard, but the improvement over that one is substantial; whilst the Train had been chugging away on the UK scene for quite some years, for many listeners this is the album that put them on the map. Trimming back the stable of guest musicians substantially and offering a spruced-up sound which combines progressive rock song structures and compositional techniques to a somewhat broader aesthetic than most prog, the album manages to be simultaneously quite accessible and at the same time still a nostalgic journey through Genesis-derived symphonic landscapes.Founder member Greg Spawton's guitar work on this is what enables much of this diversity, particularly in the way he brings in influences which most prog guitarists tend to overlook. For instance, his performance on Uncle Jack begins in a folky style with just a whiff of bluegrass to it, but as the song progresses and complexities pile up it ends up gradually mutating into something much more unusual. David Longdon's one of those prog vocalists who likes to mimic Peter Gabriel, but at least he's actually quite good at it, his performance sounding absolutely natural and not forced at all.The traces of Spock's Beard I could hear on The Underfall Yard are well and truly gone - as, indeed, is any obvious imitation of past prog bands beyond the obvious Genesis pastoralisms. This album was, at the time, one of my biggest surprises of the year - having been none too impressed by the band's back catalogue, I really hadn't planned on giving them another go, but the high praise given to this one made me feel compelled to relent on that and I was at first markedly impressed.However, with the passage of time the spark of English Electric has rather faded for me. It's not so much a case of familiarity breeding contempt - if anything, I have relistened to it much less than I expected to. It's more a matter of Big Big Train's schtick wearing thin. This soppy nostalgia for a golden age that never really was - the eternal illusion that grumpy middle-aged men are prone to that society had it more or less right back when they were 6 and it's been downhill ever since - is something that I have an increasing lack of patience for, and the artistic aesthetic it inspires feels increasingly shallow and vapid. It is certainly competently executed here, but precisely because it's a hollow reflection on faded glory rather than something genuinely \"progressive\" in the sense of doing something new with the collection of old motifs it brings together, I suspect its star will wane sooner rather than later."

          "text": "There's some bands that hardly fail, you can actually see their love and their effort on making the best music possible. And that's the case of BIG BIG TRAIN.I'm not a BIG BIG TRAIN longer fan, I've discovered them when they were about to release the magnificent The Underfall Yard (2009) and they were giving away the epic track that carried the name of the album. I was so immediatelly amazed by that song and that sound and that band that I went straight to their website and bought a bundle with The Underfall Yard (2009) and their previous The Difference Machine (2007).When I've heard they were working on a new album, and that would be a 2 part project called 'English Electric' I was already happy just by heard that.I am now listening English Electric (Part One) (2012) for the first time. And they just can't fail. Their music is full of emotion, charged with a sentiment that you hardly can see in any other band, specially in Progressive Rock.They work slowly on their records and make sure every little piece is right on place. The sounds of instruments specially, is SO good to hear an album that actually have real drums sounds, a bass sound that's not equal to the other 100 albums released in this month, pianos and not cheap keyboards, flutes, the list go on and on...It's rich in every aspect it's grande not being too pompous, it's emotional, makes me shiver, and the most important thing, it makes you want to listen again and again.The band knows the music they're doing is good, only bands that know they have a great material to offer makes their album available to listen on Bandcamp (bigbigtrain.bandcamp.com/album/english-electric-part-one).And you know why they do that? Cause they know that if you listen, you'll buy, something inside you tells that you need to have it. And that's actually what happens, everytime."

          "text": "Big Big Train excel on their best release to date \"English Electric Part One\". The fact that this is a first part obviously means there is soon to be released a sequel and if it is as fabulous as this release we are in for a real treat. From the very beginning I was taken on a journey of melodic and innovative musicianship with beautiful rivers of flute and uplifting guitar solos, along with swathes of keyboards and crystalline ambience. Each track is diverse from the one preceding and makes this a very entertaining hour of music. The songs are accessible enough for the average music listener but have inspired musicianship that lift the compositions out of the ordinary and into the more progressive side of music. The flute is absolutely stunning and the grinding organ punctuates the atmospheres with a retro 70s feel.Songs like the wonderful 'Judas Unrepentant' have the 70s sound and yet remain modern enough to fit into the current music scene comfortably. There is an uplifting soundscape on such songs, and the band leave room for quiet passages of flute played with aplomb by the incomparable David Longdon, and the string section by Ken Brake is mesmirising tranquillity. This track is one of the greatest pieces of music I have heard in years, and even features strong organ soloing, and meanders into quiet textures allowing it to lift again into the main bright melody. The vocals of Longdon are always clean and easy on the ears, sounding somewhat like Peter Gabriel in places, a clear influence.The opening track 'The First Rebreather' is also masterfully composed with lengthy solos and a soul stirring melody, reminiscent of Genesis, with creative shifting time sigs. Surprisingly after this prog sound the following track 'Uncle Jack' is a diversion into Cotton Eye Joe banjo and hoedown musical shapes. It seems to work though as it is so unique to the album and shows the band having fun with their creativity. Another diversion on this album is the ballad 'Upton Heath' that is acoustically driven and has a beautiful Celtic folk flavour of accordion sounds and a strong multi harmony of voices throughout. The violins and flute are a nice touch and enhance the folk textures on this very accessible track.On the flip side of the band's style 'Summoned by Bells' is a 9 minute romp with cascading flute and guitar picking and violins that melt into the icy atmospheres. It has a dreamy feel, especially in the verses and at times a heavier guitar riff from Greg Spawton breaks through to keep things interesting. The electric piano is quite bluesy, and there is a section sounding like Genesis as it moves into a new time sig. Andy Poole on keyboards and bass keeps a consistent rhythm and the steady tempo from percussionist Nick D'Virgilio is always reliable. Spawton has a chance to launch into a lead guitar solo that is well accomplished striking against the tempo. The meter slows down with nice keys and a horn section that augments the atmosphere. This section is very relaxing and moves along at a measured pace as an extended coda and the lead solo is tasteful; an excellent progressive track.'A Boy In Darkness' is an 8 minute track with some odd melodies and shifting signatures. It begins with elongated musical bars that sound ethereal along with the haunting harmonies. It has a darker feel purposefully due to the thematic content. It is delightfully unique on the album, with more chilling atmospheres, and an overall sense of foreboding. These atmospheres are augmented by sustained violins and reflective vocals echoed by multi harmonies. The keyboard effects have an esoteric quality, echoing with distant bells, wind effects and dissonant notes. The Hammond organ sound crunches gloriously into the song and is joined by violin serrations and heavy guitars. The flute joins in and lifts the atmosphere but it still feels appropriately off kilter and disjointed. A tremolo bar wavers on the guitar and then a low ominous drone is heard. This is followed by a peaceful passage of lonely violin and Longdon's vocals return with reflective lyrics. Overall this is another of the masterpieces of the album.'Winchester From St Giles' Hill' is another case in point that focuses on varying musical styles. 'Hedgerow' closes the album with another lengthy piece at about 9 minutes, and sounds totally different to the other tracks, beginning with a folk tinged melody and ending with pastoral tones with multi layered majestic harmonies.Overall this is another great album from Big Big Train who are slowly gaining a solid reputation and wider acceptance on a worldwide scale. They are capable of incredible music and the compositions are infectious and accessible for the FM radio market. \"English Electric Part One\" is packed with brilliance, and no doubt part two will be followed up soon, and hopefully as consistent in quality as this magnificent release."

          "text": "I have waited a long time, with many, many listens, before reviewing this, the latest release by Big Big Train, which, if the reviews and ratings on this site are to be believed, is one of the finest prog rock releases of all time. Indeed, only one reviewer has given it anything less than five star masterpiece rating.I gave that to the exceptional The Underfall Yard, but quite a bit of that was for deeply personal reasons. I was really looking forward to this, and was delighted when it plopped through the door last month.Let me say straight away that this album contains some of the finest progressive rock I have heard this, or, indeed, in many a year. At its best, which is on most of it, it has the feel of much of what drew me to the genre in the first place, that wonderful English pastoral sound. The Genesis comparisons are, perhaps, rather obvious, but, to these ears and mind, it is more in the fact that a track such as Uncle Jack is so marvellously quirky and, well, English in the Genesis or Python sense.The utter highlight of the album, and a very strong contender for track of this decade thus far, is Judas Unrepentant. In fact, as I will explain later in this review, it was only at this stage of the album that I really sat up and took notice on first listen. The harmonies, staggeringly strong vocals by David Longdon (who is surely becoming one of our finest), the fusion of classic and modern progressive soundscapes, particularly on keyboards, make this ridiculously enjoyable and strong. Everything flows easily into each separate movement, and that flute solo.....well, Gabriel has his natural successor in Longdon. The use of strings and woodwind is also exceptional. A symphonic masterpiece, no more, no less.Of course, much of this here is a paeon to a fast disappearing English countryside, much as Selling England was to a disappearing society. The gorgeous Upton Heath is a smooth, very beautiful, example, and, if you close your eyes and use your imagination, you can see yourself walking on the Dorset heathland. It is a brave band, indeed, who make so much use of traditional orchestra instruments, and, again, this lot do it with such aplomb in a gentle, folk prog, setting. I also admire deeply here, and elsewhere, the choral vocals.Another trick this lot manage so well is the sudden change of mood. So, we go from a beautiful walk to something altogether more sinister and menacing on A Boy In Darkness. Doom laden in its low key sounds, you jump when the chorus simply explodes with a sinister symphonic energy. This all supports some of the most intelligent lyrics you can imagine, because the subject matter is a report into conditions in a 19th century colliery, and the exploitation and deaths of young boys \"sent down the pit\". This is social commentary translated into musical darkness at its best, and, again, it reaffirms the band's position to me as the natural successors to Genesis in this era. To call them some kind of neo-prog tribute is both lazy and, actually, plain wrong. They are much more than that.And, from this, we are taken to the delightful, cheery, bouncy, almost pop psychedelic joy that is the album's closer, Hedgerow. Of course, the subject matter is easily deduced, but the effect on the aural senses is one of sheer joy, almost an orgasm for the ears and mind. The singing is quite incredible, and the pace of the band never falls below that of relentless foot tapping, especially the guitars, and the strings are used to great effect again. The reprise of the vocal harmonies at the denouement has you almost weeping with the sheer joy of life and all around us.So, with such praise, why do I rate this album as an excellent one, out of step with those colleagues who rate it a masterpiece? It is simply because, as joyful as the tracks I have written about above are, I actually find this to be too inconsistent to merit the full five stars. Take the opener, The First Rebreather, as a good example. There are bursts of that Longdon voice (which I first fell in love with on Martin Orford's great The Old Road), there is some stunning guitar work, especially, but I find this strangely inconsistent as a track, or, I don't know, maybe trying to be a little bit too clever, because the shifts in time signatures I find to be confusing and, frankly, unnecessary. When it is good, it is very good (and the bass playing is especially good), but it is not only confusing, I also find, after some thirty odd listens now, it to be rather dull in parts, and find myself losing my attention in places. You never have that on a masterpiece.I also feel the same way about Winchester From Giles Hill. It starts off beautifully with deep flute, some lilting vocal harmonies and a jazzy feel on rhythm, but, I don't know, I find it very difficult to keep going throughout the track. The main vocal section sounds strained, and parts of it are, well, dull again. The strained comment also applies to parts of the otherwise sublime Summoned by Bells, which does feature some lovely brass in fusion with haunting guitar at the close.I hope I have put across here adequately the fact that this is an excellent work, with a great deal to commend itself to fans of progressive rock. 90% of it is simply to die for. This lineup will, I earnestly hope, continue to bring us joy for many years to come. I especially welcome the participation of Dave Gregory, probably the finest musician to come out of the New Wave era. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it to those who are thinking about buying it. It is excellent. It just ain't a masterpiece. Bet you the next one is, though!"

          "text": "Coincidence that I get two distinct albums that both feature Nick D'Virgilio on drums in my recent purchase cart? Nah, the man is a massive talent, turning Mystery's latest offering \"The World is a Game\" into a propulsive affair the simply devastates. He has also serviced some of the finest prog musicians anywhere, look it up if need be.Big Big Train has leaped over countless summits in arriving to \"English Electric\", starting with the promising \"Gathering Speed\" then the massive \"The Difference Machine\"(a personal favorite) and then, the critically acclaimed \"The Underfall Yard\". Truth is Greg Spawton is an accomplished composer, a stellar guitarist and multi-instrumentalist and has surrounded himself with trusty longtime collaborator Andy Poole, as well as bringing in on the preceding opus, the evocative David Longdon on vocals to replace Sean Filkins , no slouch on the mike, him! Here we have the legendary Andy Tillison of The Tangent fame on assorted keys(never has he played better !) as well as the aforementioned Nick D'Virgilio. It is to be noted that Dave Gregory officiates on guitar, he of XTC fame and one of the most solid performers of the 80s still active today.. . \"The First Rebreather\" kicks off this one in style, very English and very prog , the arrangement has all the hallmarks of classic symphonic prog and easily rekindling fond reminiscence of Collins-era Genesis, without the commercial pop veneer. Andy Poole lays down some mean bass motifs that pulsate with glorified diversity and all the adornments are perfect, from mellifluous flute, played by David Longdon who positively shines on the microphone, a sensational vocalist and an emotive spirit. Lots of strings on this one, so tighten your symphonic belt, replete with a buzzing guitar solo like you have never heard before! Torrential gusts of power and substance are elevated by some stellar production, showcasing the whole as well as the parts and maintaining that blissy buzz.\"Uncle Jack\" is more playful; featuring some stunning choir work (severe nods to Gentle Giant, here) as well something Ant Phillips could come up with when not fondling his beloved 12 string acoustic. A strong medieval tone ruminates gently, a countrified air, silky percussion and breezy vocals and choirs adorn the rolling green lea , birds chirping elatedly. Some banjo skiffling along for the ride. Quite an original sounding premise and a treat for the weary.Back to classic sympho-prog with \"Winchester from St Giles' Hill\" owner of a massive atmosphere, very smooth and laid back (think ELP's \"Take a Pebble\") but equally armed with a poignant chorus that reaches Marillionesque proportions. Splashes of flute and strings fortify the strong classical feel. Please notice the shuffling drums and the grandiose chorus, a genius vehicle led by a stunning vocal from Dave Longdon , who really impresses immensely. Scintillating prog, this! We then have Tillison showing up on piano like a true ivory master that he is. Ridiculously seductive, almost scary, its that good. A Spawton guitar duel with D'Virgilio on drums is an earful only surpassed by the huge chorus ending this monumental track, a real classic.Some commentators have already anointed \"Judas Repentant\" as the firecracker composition on this winning release and one can quickly see the merit of such lofty praise. Big Big sound, a wider scope of harmonious delirium, some rapid fire playing, especially those damn drums, clobbering everything in its way, burly, hard and devastating. The anthemic qualities are hyper-evident, the majestic flute playing with the mellotron cascades. Unexpected strings sweep into the mix, heightening the passion as Longdon plaintively sings on, raging and dramatic, keys whirring wildly (check out that genius organ solo from Andy Tillison, whew! Deadly). A manic tour de force outro finishes the deal.\"Summoned by Bells\" is the proverbial ballad, dexterous piano and voice driven with some clever off-beat gilding, very close to Collins-era Genesis (even mentioning \"rooftops\". Yeah, right! Coincidence! Nah!), with Banksian keyboard washes and typical voice work. \"Come on now\" indeed! A corkscrew guitar solo (Dave Gregory?) scorches like a molten flame- thrower and then, suddenly a serene passage that is dreamily psychedelic, daring to import some serious trombone infiltration! Yes you read it correctly = TROMBONE! Ballsy move!\"Upton Heath\" is very British, with mandolins, banjo, double-bass and accordion leading the way, in folky style of ensemble playing, again rekindling hints of Penguin Caf\ufffd Orchestra and Anthony Phillips , as well as some clear Canterbury school influences. The main difference is the soul voice of Dave Longdon, adding desperate warmth to the pastoral surroundings, the magical flute being the main culprit.\"A Boy in Darkness\"as the title implies, is a more somber affair, the pleading vocal seemingly well ahead the pack, astutely orchestrated with crafty symphonics and a gruesome chorus. The contrasts are deep and dark, the instrumental sections brutal and corrosive (Dave Gregory in particular), the voice parts decisive and arresting. Heavy stuff!\"Hedgerow\" sounds more like XTC; clearly Gregory is a huge influence, as this is Brit-pop with obtuse prog flavorings, hints of the Byrds, Bread and the Beatles. Yet, the instrumental part goes totally in another direction, deeply symphonic, with huge swells of emotion, flute, violin and keys are its purveyor. The main theme is thunderous. And then back to the beginning but louder. A brainy dollop of exalted prog.There is just way too much to like, an opus that has the incredible Longdon voice, mind blowing guitar work from Gregory, jaw dropping keys work from Tillison, a rhythm section as powerful as one could hope for, D'Virgilio especially. Killer arrangements, original songs and daring adventure.4.5 Anglais electriques"

          "text": "Hey guys! Once there was a Brit-prog band named GENESIS , if you like BBT you\ufffdll flip upside down with them. Some of the band members are still around. Maybe you have heard of one of them Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks, Phill Collins and Peter Gabriel; back then he was the vocalist and main composer of that ensemble. He absorved all the mystic ghosts that haunt his birthland; which by the way was England. Trumpets, kings and all that [&*!#]; brought to modern times. Intelligent surreal stories with the famous conspiracy-like voice, in \"off\" (the same as Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson; it runs in the \"Brits\", blood) and the music compositions, if not overwhelming, were very original in language and structure. .... It was not their virtuosity neither, ( of course they were no punk-rockers!) it had to do with the creative rush of breaking-ground for the first time, that kind of rare and unique rush. BBT; however well trained in their instruments as they are, fall in the the everlasting conflict of any composer who still hasn't found his own language; being both: original and sublime. Problem is, that the original parts are not original and the sublime is not their own. I dislike imitators, tributers or whatever you want to call the kind, that sounds like someone else, who was there before, in time. Without any kind of regards whatsoever; or the now famous \"my influences\" cheap-talk. I don\ufffdt think there is a creative shortage in composition (to me that\ufffds what prog is all about) as to praise this kind,(seriously!). Wake up!! and listen to GENESIS first albums. In that direction you may also encounter another band; their name is or was (no one still knows) King Crimson start easy, go for the \"Lizard\" album. Don\ufffdt settle for less this will make BBT (if lucky) find their own route. Remember: \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\"; it still does and it will be like that, it seems for a long time. 2 PA stars"

          "text": "Probably should win some award for the most over hyped album of the year. Now there is no doubt that this group know exactlly what they are doing and the tehcnical level of the playing backs thats up. They also avoid the usual late seventies Genesis clone approach that so many neo prog bands seem to be into and that perhaps gets them extra brownie points. However I've listened to this at least 5 times and I'm still struggling to be that gripped or excited by it. There are some nice bits and bits and moments of inspiration but in general it comes across just a bit too much 'prog by numbers'.The opening track is probably my favourite on the album. They have a real hook going for the first few minutes and could have fallen into the trap of trying to repeat it too much but instead allow the music to find its natural flow. The end track is also excellent and reaches a good emotional peak. What I have a problem with is the most of the middle bit that doesn't seem to have either the musical content or direction to impress me. I just don't get what its supposed to be. Its all a bit bland and lacking to my ears.Its not cliched though and I guess the fact you can't relate it that easily to other bands has lead to a fair amount of gushing praise. But for me I'm just not feeling itNeverthless it is an ambitious effort and they have used a good variety of musical instruments to add additional spice. Quite nice middle of the road neo syphonic prog album. Best check it out and make up your own mind."

          "text": "BIB BIG TRAIN haven't made an album yet that I wasn't impressed with. This is the fourth recording i've purchased by this band and to my ears they are a modern day GENESIS. Not that I think of them everytime I hear their music because I don't, but it's that very English sound that is done so well. The lyrics are always meaningful and seem to be able to touch my heart. Like the last studio album they have lots of guests on board, in fact more this time including Andy Tillison and Martin Orford (I thought he was retired).\"The First Rebreather\" might be the best track i've heard from this band, and for me the most GENESIS sounding as well. The guitar playing over top as the vocals come in is priceless ! Check out the flute and then the bass and drums join in. So good. Nice flute solo before 3 minutes and then a guitar solo 5 minutes in. The emotion is felt when the vocals return with passion. Gulp. That opening guitar is back. Man this is just so good. One of the best tracks of 2012 for me. I should mention as well that Andy Tillison guests on this song playing organ, piano, moog and keyboards. \"Uncle Jack\" is certainly different with the opening banjo. Vocals join in quickly in this catchy tune. Again this just feels good. Mandolin in this one as well as some female backing vocals. \"Winchester From St. Giles' Hill\" is a beautiful song and the keyboards after 2 minutes reminds me of Banks. Check out the flute a minute later when the vocals stop. I really like the guitar before 5 1/2 minutes as the organ and drums start to impress before the vocals return. Andy Tillison is back on \"Judas Unrepentant\" playing organ and keyboards. Nice intro before the vocals join in. We get that late as well after 5 1/2 minutes. Such meaningful lyrics here. Good song.\"Summoned By Bells\" is the longest track at just under 9 1/2 minutes. Vocals and piano lead early before the violin joins in. Flute 2 minutes in and the backing vocals before 2 1/2 minutes are a nice touch. Mellotron a minute later. Great sound 6 minutes in with the organ, guitar and drums standing out. Nice to hear horns late as well. A very enjoyable tune. \"Upton Heath\" is a mellow tune with acoustic guitar, light drums, reserved vocals and more. Banjo and mandolin also make appearances on this one. My least favourite song on here. \"A Boy In Darkness\" is an emotional track considering the lyrics. And the title of the track certainly has a lot of meaning in light of those words. Andy is back guesting on keyboards and organ. Check out the flute and bass after 4 minutes. Amazing track ! \"Hedgerow\" is such an uplifting song ! I can just imagine someone who has worked underground for so long getting some time off and being blown away by nature and sunshine. I can just picture him dancing around and we can hear his dog as he calls him as they wander the fields. Love the instrumental section that follows with that mournful violin. The vocals return including Martin Orford's backing vocals. The horns remind me of THE BEATLES.Yeah this deserves the hype and it's not surprising to see this album on so many top 10 lists for 2012."

          "text": "Hurray, Phil Collins rides again - more energetically than ever!Joking apart, this is yet another enjoyable BBT collection, very much in the vein of its great predecessor, the UNDERFALL YARD. The ingredients are the same. Most of the music is expertly performed and full of yearning. The band seem to mourn the passing of an Old England where \"heavy industry\" still counted for something. They denounce some of the social cruelties of that same Old England; they express a longing for the landscapes and cities of their youth; now that they've reached middle age, they feel great sadness, since what's left of those landscapes will soon leave them behind...That, at least, is the impression I get from ENGLISH ELECTRIC (PART ONE). The great question is, of course, if Part Two will be any different in mood. Until we find that out (at the time of writing, the wait can't be long any more) we may ask ourselves to what extent BBT have achieved their musical ambitions. In my opinion, the first six tracks of this particular collection are gripping from start to finish (which makes for a first-rate 42-minute album, just as inspiring as the classics you remember from the 1970s) but thereafter the quality of the music soon deteriorates: on \"A Boy in Darkness\" David Longdon's voice really starts to grate (OK, I know it's not MEANT to be an upbeat track, but still...) and during \"Hedgerow\" (a pointless, over-long singalong) I just couldn't wait to switch the album off.I was glad that this time we were offered some wonderfully exciting keyboard solos from the great Andy Tillison. I wish Dave Gregory were given more chances to shine on his electric guitar! Whenever Gregory does appear, my heart leaps half a mile. FINAL VERDICT: Strongly recommended, but not what I'd call a flawless masterpiece.P.S. Twelve years after I wrote the above review, I decided to upgrade ENGLISH ELECTRIC (PART ONE) and award it a full five stars. Over the years the album grew on me. Listening to various live performances helped me appreciate the material included. I still think \"A Boy in Darkness\" is a little strange (what exactly is the point of giving such a downbeat track an upbeat instrumental middle section?) but I also find it terribly moving. \"Hedgerow\" doesn't annoy me anymore - quite the opposite. In fact, I'm convinced there's not a weak track on the entire album. \"East Coast Racer\" is one of the greatest 'symphonic prog' openers of recent times, and both \"Keeper of Abbeys\" and \"The Permanent Way\" are simply sublime. In my view, together with ENGLISH ELECTRIC (PART TWO) this album forms one of the most enjoyable & emotionally mature statements in 21st century prog. (And BBT didn't leave it there: their 2016 album FOLKLORE would be just as much fun. Bravissimo!)"

          "text": "8/10Straightforward, But Right On Track.\"English Electric Part One\" is Big Big Train's eight album, released in 2012. The title implies, obviously, a Part Two, released in 2013. Even more so than the predecessor \"The Underfall Yard\", this newer release was immensely praised by Prog Rock aficionados, and has even been considered by some to be one of the greatest albums of the genre of the decade. Although this last statement is a bit exaggerated, \"English Electric Part One\" is most definitely the greatest Prog Rock album of 2012, proving that Big Big Train has officially matured as a group.The music on the album is for many, very reminiscent of old Symphonic Prog groups, more in particular Genesis: that is especially because of the vast array of instrumentation that is used on this album, especially keyboards. But there's a lot of clean and acoustic guitar, flutes, strings, horns, and so on. It's definitely the most lush release so far from Big Big Train. The previous albums however also had an astonishing amount of varied instrumentation. The brand new improvements that really surprise are the outstanding songwriting skills this band proves to have, as they are able to consistently write beautiful, gorgeously crafted songs, that hit almost all of the right spots. Another massive improvement of theirs is the structuring of the songs: if in earlier albums, their tracks at times felt a little messy and over- blown in length and flow, now they sound in order, perfectly structured and well-balanced.The album itself shows not only a great and diverse palette when it comes to instrumentation; Every song, basically, has a unique trait that makes it distinguishable over the rest of them, and that is a quality that is hard to pull of in one album and impressive when successful, considering the structuring problems the band had with \"The Underfall Yard\". A song like \"Uncle Jack\" has a predominant banjo, while \"Judas Unrepented\" has much more organ/keyboards, \"Upton Heath\" meanwhile has a very memorable and beautiful choir section in the chorus.\"English Electric Part One\" is a sweet, gentle, melancholic piece of work, strengthened by fantastic musicianship, including the charismatic, lyrical vocals that weave in each track all of the different melodies beautifully. It's diverse, catchy, lush, and challenging: four qualities that are more than enough for a Prog Rock album to work."

          "text": "Good but could have been greatAfter reading all the ravishing reviews about this band and album decided to pay a couple of bucks in a well- known site and download it, won't say that wasted my money, because theEnglish Electric (Part One)has outstanding individual performances, a good sound and a few interesting passages, but overall I find it generic, lack of personality and extremely boring.YES vocal references and some GENESIS influenced passages are not enough to save this album from oblivion, let's be honest, I can't find a single memorable song. So, in my opinion the problem is not in the sound (which is high quality), virtuosity of the musicians (can't be denied), but in the tedious Alternative/Indie/Crossover/Prog related compositions, that bored me after a few minutes.The album is opened byThe First Rebreatherand the first thing I notice is the vocals, being that seem like a blend of Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins and Fish (Not bad at all) and then at the mark of 1:29, a passage that reminds me too much ofLos Endos. But to be honest I like the track, it has brilliance, strength and versatility, even though that the word originality is not in their dictionary. The best song of the album, only weakened by that Gabrielish flute passage that sounds nothing like Peter Gabriel's flute.After a promising opener, I was starting to sing that all the praises were justified, but reality hit me hard when I listenedUncle Jack, some sort of comedy relief in the style of ELP songs likeThe Sheriff & Jeremy Bender, but without the freshness and audacity of the famous power trio, and to make it worst, the fantastic vocal work ofThe First Rebreatherisn't remotely repeated here?Well played but absolutely forgettable.Winchester From St Giles' Hillis a pretty musical piece but absolutely anodyne, the intentions are good, the piano passages are delightful, but the composition is absolutely tame and predictable, sorry, but I fell asleep for a couple of seconds when listening this song the first time. Sometimes a beautiful tune is not enough.Judas Unrepentantintro takes me back to the late 70's when Rick Wakeman was experimenting with new synths and the infamous Birotron, which was great in albums likeCriminal Record, but absolutely dated today. At least in the vocal parts they give signs of life and seem to find an own sound?..Well, until they start with the gabrielish flute and the late Genesis Mellotron Choirs.Summoned By Bellsis a song of contrasts, the first five minutes are really repetitive and boring in the style of Phil Collins, but suddenly they allow themselves create one of the most brilliant moments in the album, with jazzy leanings and powerful guitar, drums and keys interplay, but when they are sounding great, fall again into some tedious Kenny G like ending section that really turns me down. Just when they dared to be ambitious and vibrant, ruined it all with a depressive closing section, and to make it worst is followed by another forgettable track asUpton Heaththat works as a Valium (Please guys stop using sections so reminiscent ofLos Endos & Squonk, especially when so watered).A Boy In Darknessis another uneven song, the first couple of minutes are absolutely soporiferous , but when I was ready to press the skip button, the song changed dramatically, at last they dared to unleash themselves, here we can listen everything, from heavy guitar solos to Ian Anderson / Thijs Van Leer influenced flutes, dramatic violin and some first class Psyche/Folk Prog that really impressed me, simply frantic and vibrant, this is what this guys need to do.The album is closed byHedgerow, another exiting song that combines the na\ufffdve sound of 60's British Invasion, Psychedelic touches and excellent vocal work, seems as they reserved the best for the end.Well, now comes the rating part that I hate so much. Until the fifth minute ofSummoned By BellsI was decided to giveEnglish Electric (Part One)two weak stars, butv then everything changed, they left the safe play and took risks, ending the album in a very high level. It's a pity I have to go with only 3 stars, because this release has some impressive music, but it's so uneven that can't go higher.}I'm 100% sure that if this guys dare to take risks, they are able to give us a couple of essential masterpieces, but we'll have to wait and have faith..The skills are there, what they need is the decision."

          "text": "Ever since the release of The Underfall Yard, a question I asked myself fairly often was 'Is the modern incarnation of Big Big Train one of my favorite bands, or is this just one of my favorite albums?' Far Skies Deep Time certainly pushed me in one direction, and fortunately with the release of English Electric Part 1 I can definitively pick a side and say, yes, they are one of my favorite bands. While the album manages to be both better in almost every way, yet not quite as good as TUY, its addition solidifies Longdon-era Big Big Train as a great modern symphonic band.Avoiding that last comparison to TUY for now, let's talk about what Big Big Train's overall sound is like. They are listed here as Crossover, but they are now obviously Symphonic. There is a strong balance between structured, melodic instrumental passages with powerfully sung ones. Instrumentally there is also a good balance between guitar and keyboard (as well as other eclectic instruments) which all take the lead about the same amount. While the music found within the songs is great, I think the most important thing about this band is that they are very concerned with crafting their albums as complete pieces, and English Electric is no different: you'll find repeated musical and lyrical themes, the songs are structured in a logical way in regards to mood and length, and the albums as a whole are kept to reasonable lengths. Another important aspect of Big Big Train's music is their lyrical content. Lately they've been interested in telling real world stories through their music, and EE takes this to the extreme with each song telling the tale of a noted Englishman, whether they were socially famous or just important to one of the band members.So, how has this changed since the last album? Surprisingly a lot. TUY was critically and commercially Big Big Train's most successful album so it's very refreshing to see them treat their new material so differently. Most importantly, EE is sonically miles ahead of TUY. If I could find one complaint about the previous album it's that while all of the songs were great, there was a lack of diversity. Taking a look at how the first four songs start out, it's like they made a specific point to be as diverse as possible: a gloomy guitar line starts the first song, warm banjo strumming the second, pastoral flute and piano the third, and furious organ and guitar to start the fourth. The choice of instruments has also been expanded; as mentioned, the banjo makes an appearance, as well as multiple flute and violin passages. There is a return of the brass band from TUY as well as the addition of a few female vocal harmonies. Judging EE on these textural elements alone, it is expertly made and it would be challenging to find a contemporary album that could stand up to it. The quality of the production is also stellar, and even at the conclusion of the album where 1,000 things are going on you can hear everything perfectly.The only area that I find TUY overshadowing this album is in the composition. English Electric is a more adventurous album in terms of song structures compared to its somewhat formulaic predecessor, and because of this, it is hit or miss. About half of the songs here are spectacular and the emotional climaxes, when they pay off, are really hard hitting and even surpass some on TUY. However, some of the songs in the middle section drag on a bit , some of the stylistic choices can be a little boring, and the only attempt to recreate a passage from the previous album (the ethereal brass coda of 'Victorian Brickwork') falls pretty flat in comparison. While the songs can be a little inconsistent, a really special note must be made for the closer, 'Hedgerow,' which contains one of the most beautiful musical moments I've ever heard which is only so effective because of the seven songs that come before it.Even though the sum of the individual songs doesn't have the same success of the last album, English Electric Part One is still a great overall package. The wonderful thing about the album is that it is clear that the whole piece was the main focus and you're really rewarded for listening from start to finish. Furthermore I'd go so far as to call it one of my favorite arranged albums ever and I could listen to the instrumental diversity all day (and have in fact repeated the closer on multiple occasions). A year later it's clear that this is one of 2012's best, and comes in as a close second for Big Big Train's best album. Simply put, this is must-hear material and we can only hope that their next main album continues the band's masterful approach to composing albums as a whole."

Well, the much praised The Underfall yard did not exactly won me over. it was clear that the band was good, but there was something missing yet at that point. Actually the CD sounded a little overworked too. But when I heard the following EP Far Skies Deep Time, I knew they had nailed it! It was the perfect combination of great songwriting, perfect arrangements and excellent songwriting, coupled with outstanding performances. That did the trick. So I was quite anxious to hear what would come next.English Electric (Part One) is basicly everything I had hoped for: great symphonic prog rock which mixes very well simple, nice melodies with complex arrangements and inspired performances of all involved. The comparisons with Gabriel-era Genesis are not a coincidence. Not only is this band highly influenced by that band, but they also found the right formula that made Genesis the classic band they were (all the elements mentioned before). Still, Big Big Train does not copy Genesis, that of the same matter dutch band Odyssice captured so well 70\ufffds Camel spirit without really sounding like a cover band. That\ufffds the difference: BBT (and Odyssice) produce a familiar style of music, but they do too have a personality of their own all along. That\ufffds very rare.Of course the album would have never worked if they hadn\ufffdt have the excellent songwriting hability to match their obvious terrific technique. There are absolute no fillers, with all the tunes being very well done both in terms of writing and, specially, of performances. It\ufffds so hard to see an album where every instrument, every voice, every note fits in so smoothly (another Genesis trait during their heydey). There are no fillers nor highlights, all the tracks do stand on their own, although the opener The First Rarebreather may be a personal favorite. Certainly BBT finally reached a maturity rarely seen nowadays. Since singer and multi intrumentist David Longdon joined the fold they have been getting better and better with each release. And his flute playing is certainly one of the most interesting features of this recordOk, some people will cringe upon hearing this CD, claiming the music has nothing original (meaning zanny), that they play too \"safe\" (nothing to shock you) and break no new ground (even at the expense of the music itself). I wll disagree, since they are quite original on their own way. It\ufffds quite accessible, I admit it, but still it takes several spins to fully grasp its full richness. And the music is beautiful, skillfully played and imaginatively arranged. To me this is good enough. Wrap it up with an excellent production work and you\ufffdll have one of the most stunning works I\ufffdve heard in a long, long time.I\ufffdm really anxious to get English Electric (Part Two).Rating: 4,5 stars. Highly recommended!!"

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "name": "BIG BIG TRAIN",
      "genre": "Crossover Prog",
      "country": "United Kingdom",
      "biography": "Formed in 1990 in Bournemouth, Dorset, England\n\nBIG BIG TRAIN was formed by Andy POOLE and Greg SPAWTON. They were joined by Ian COOPER (keyboards),\n\nSteve HUGHES\n\n(drums) and Canadian vocalist Martin READ. Initial influences on the band's music included Steve HACKETT, Anthony PHILLIPS, IT BITES and PREFAB SPROUT.  A demo cassette tape of the band's first songs, recorded on 8-track, was released in October 1991 and was followed by live performances. The demo tape \"From the River to the Sea\" was re-recorded and released as a self-financed demo CD in May 1992, following which BBT played some higher profile gigs in England.\n\nIn January 1993, a second demo tape, \"The Infant Hercules\" was released and the band then spent the next six months writing the music for its first proper album, \"Goodbye to the Age of Steam\". This was recorded in a hectic two week period in July 1993. Soon afterwards, BBT signed to the progressive rock label GEP, where they found themselves as label mates of IQ.\n\n\"Goodbye to the Age of Steam\" was a big leap forward for the band, both in terms of songwriting and recording quality. The response to the album was very positive, culminating in a licensing deal in Japan where the CD was re-released in 1995, with a bonus track.\n\nIn the meantime, Ian COOPER had left the band (for family rather than musical reasons) and live performances were put on hold while a replacement was sought and a new album was written.\n\nRecording of BBT's second album commenced in July of 1995 (with Greg filling in on keyboards) and continued, sporadically, until completion 18 months later. During the sessions, a new keyboard player, Tony M\ufffdLLER was recruited. Some of the songs from the new album were debuted at the band's only show from this period at the Astoria, London. \"English Boy Wonders\" was finally released in autumn 1997, although in an incomplete state as the band had run out of money to finish the album. \"English Boy Wonders\" combined progressive rock (GENESIS, VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR) with indie-pop influences (XTC, THE CURE.)\n\nSteve HUGHES left BIG BIG TRAIN in September 1998 and went on to join THE ENID. He was replaced by Pete HIBBIT. They were subsequently dropped by their record label, GEP. After a few more live performances, the band's momentum seemed all but spent.\n\nGreg and Andy began work on some new songs without the rest of the band, more out of habit than with any intention to continue recording as BIG BIG TRAIN. However, an album of material slowly began to take shape and BBT started to consider booking some recording sessions with long-time collaborator, Rob AUBREY.\n\nRather than book studio sessions, BBT decided to build their own studio and record the album themselves. This decision put the band on a more independent and sustainable footing.\n\nIn February 2002, the third BBT album, \"Bard\" was released on the band's own label (Treefrog - later to become English Electric Recordings.) At the same time, THE ENID went into hibernation and Steve HUGHES rejoined BBT.\n\nA new vocalist,\n\nSean FILKINS\n\nwas recruited to replace original vocalist Martin READ and a fourth album, \"Gathering Speed\", was released in March 2004. \"Gathering Speed\" was a concept album which told the story of a fighter pilot in the summer of 1940. It marked a significant change in direction for BIG BIG TRAIN with the band exploring classic prog-rock territory with the addition of post-rock influences (SIGUR ROS, MOGWAI.)\n\n\"The Difference Machine\" album was released in September 2007 and went on to become the band's biggest selling CD. \"The Difference Machine\" features extensive performances from Pete TREWAVAS (MARILLION), Dave MEROS (SPOCK'S BEARD) and Nick D'VIRGILIO (SPOCK'S BEARD, GENESIS, TEARS FOR FEARS.)\n\nIn 2008, BIG BIG TRAIN re-released \"English Boy Wonders\" (an updated and completed version of the album which was partly re-recorded by BBT and fully re-mixed by Rob AUBREY).\n\nIn February 2009, songwriter Gregory SPAWTON announced that Sean FILKINS and Steve HUGHES were no longer members of BIG BIG TRAIN and had been replaced by\n\nNick D'VIRGILIO\n\nand David LONGDON. Nick D'Virgilio, who plays drums for BIG BIG TRAIN on \"The Difference Machine\" and \"The Underfall Yard\" also played on GENESIS's \"Calling All Stations\".\n\nLONGDON's first solo CD \"Wild River\" (2004) featured many musicians collectively known as THE MAGIC CLUB. In 2008 Martin ORFORD (IQ) invited LONGDON to sing on his swan-song album \"The Old Road\" which was also recorded by Rob AUBREY and once again featured Nick D'VIRGILIO. Shortly afterwards, LONGDON joined BIG BIG TRAIN in time to commence work on their forthcoming album, \"The Underfall Yard\", due for release on December 15th 2009. Guest appearances on The Underfall Yard include Dave GREGORY (XTC), Francis DUNNERY (IT BITES) and Jem GODFREY (FROST*).",

          "text": "It is short, but it is easily my favourite jazz-fusion record and the best guitar driven solo effort. I give it five stars not only because it is a masterpiece, but also because it would really appeal to prog fans. Why? Because of the musicianship!!!!! All the musicians in this record are at least excellent (pay close attention to the drummers), and Al Dimeola is a guitar God. Most of the songs are in fast tempos and have plenty of solos.There is also an epic,althrough a bit short, to satisfy fans of long duration songs. I couldn't believe this was sitting on the shelf until I listened to it on August. (my father dislikes this album (and jazz- fusion in general) I just couldn't believe my ears when I heard it for the first time!Note : This album is instrumental.1. Flight Over Rio : Probably the best song in the album. I say probably because the album itself has this amazing quality of musicianship, technique, and songwriting. The song begins with a slow guitar riff, builds up in a jazz-fusion rhythms, and explodes in an accelerated musical nirvana in which a synthesizer and a guitar duel each other. Do you remember Wakeman and Steve dueling on the 2004 Yes tour? That's nothing compared to this!!! The song continues in a latin rhythm with latin percussions (kind of Santana-like) and finishes in the same way it started. 10/102. Midnight Tango : This is another song with latin touches in its percussion and rhythm. However, it is fusioned to jazz with amazing results. The guitar is absolutely phenomenal here and the keyboard behind that guitar (jazzy) gives what the song needs to sound with perfection. There is also a distorted guitar (or bass) riff that really shines. After some great soloing, another fabolous riff melts you, gives you a thousand goosebumps, and floors you. I just can't believe how powerful the music in this CD really is! The song ends with a good drum duet which wasn't really necessary (but it does not really hurt the quality of the song) 9.5/103. Mediterranean Sundance : This is a song in which guitar virtuoso Paco De Lucia harmonizes his acoustic guitar with Meola's one. The song sounds almost like flamenco with its extremely fast acoustic guitar playing style. This is one of my father's favourite songs of all times and I see why : try to find an accelerated acoustic song with this quality. It is a flawless showcase of Meola's talents. 10/104. Race With Devil On Spanish Highway : The song begins with a fast bass riff riff played with latin percussions and is sometimes interfered with lighting speed guitar runs. After that section is over, the music is more relaxing and is led by a guitar solo. The bass playing in here is pretty good and loud. The next sections involved in extremely fast drumming and riffing until a beautiful leaping guitar lick begins what is known as a masterful guitar solo. After that is over, the song takes yet another shift with similar riffs and themes but in different rhythms and continues to shift back and forth with noticeable differences and more guitar soloing until it ends with a fadeout. This has to be the most dynamic and unpredictable song on the record and a beautiful one, even if it is not a highlight of the album. 9/105. Lady Of Rome Sister Of Brazil : An acoustic track that lets you room to breath before you get to the epic (The most challenging song of the album). This little piece is outstanding and is as good (if not better) as Horizons from Genesis. 9/106. Elegant Gypsy Suite : This song may be prog rock/jazz because of the creativity, strangeness, length, style, and technique. The beginning of the track is majestic a bit playful, and obviously very complex. The riffs are very weird and interesting here, as well as the guitar sounds produced with whatever pedals he had used. After a riff repeated a big number of times, the song transform into an atmospheric section in which an amazing (and extremely strange) synthesizer solo dominates for over a minute and leave you surprised a synthesizer can sound so GOOD! The song later gets very jazzy and continues with more unusual riffing that sound very good and interesting after repeated listens. I especially love that muted guitar riff that occurs after a heavy riff somewhere close to the end of the song. The song ends very unexpectedly, but it is a good ending. 10/10Stop reading and get this album!!My Grade : A"

          "text": "This follow-up album which was released one year after the successful debut \"Land of The Midnight Sun\" is another masterpiece album. Meola brought in other talented musicians to record this album: Paco De Lucia (acoustic guitar), Jan Hammer who used to play with Jeff Beck, great bass guitar player Anthony Jackson and his Return To Forever colleague Mr. Lenny White (drums). What a great line-up. The music is still in the same vein with the debut album but this time he even put more diverse in style by exploring more acoustic guitar work. What you can hear is the excellent combination of electric as well as acoustic guitar work throughout the album. I love all tracks presented in this album and my best favorite track is \"Race With Devil On Spanish Highway\" and \"Elegant Gypsy Suite\". The music is tightly composed with many tempo changes; dominated with guitar and percussive work.Highly recommended!"

          "text": "Al Di Meola's second album is ultimately my favorite album of his and is one of the best jazz rock albums available. All the elements of total success are here, stellar musicianship, creative songwriting, and fun and imaginative variances in the music. From heavy hitting power riffing to soft spoken acoustic guitar interludes, it is all here. From the very first second of Flight Over Rio to the pulsating closing seconds of Elegant Gypsy Suite, one thing is clear, this is an album that will be remembered for many many years to come. Like I said with my review for Casino, this album will surely be up the alley of any fan of guitar oriented music and any fan of high velocity Spanish influenced jazz rock.Flight Over Rio opens the album with some intuitive bass riffing from Anthony Jackson and some very smooth keyboards from Jan Hammer. There's a definite mellow mood during this introduction, but once Di Meola enters everything slowly changes. The track becomes more fast paced and high energy, with some stellar ascending riffs from Di Meola and great and precise percussion from Mingo Lewis, as well as a great keyboard/guitar duel between Di Meola and Hammer. It opens the album brilliantly, and the quality of the songs never really goes down. Midnight Tango has a very mellow atmopshere in comparison to Flight Over Rio, with some intuitive soloing from Di Meola over a steady rhythm section and some great wavy piano lines. Slowly the pace increases, although not to the pace of the first track. The well timed chord based bass guitar work is also really well conceived. Mediterranean Sundance begins with a nice drum/percussion duet between Mingo Lewis and Lenny White, but soon becomes an exceedingly complicated piece with some great acoustic work from Di Meola and Paco de Lucia. The interplay between these two (and later along with John McLaughlin on Friday Night in San Francisco) is incredible and shows some stellar abilities for both musicians who take turns hammering out the main beat while another solos on top of it, eventually becoming a duel solo movement.Race With Devil on Spanish Highway is probably my favorite song on this album. Beginning with a strong percussive rhythm and a cool bass line, the song soon evolves into an all out shred piece with riff after riff of powerful guitar lines that intertwine and spell out brilliance. There's a riff in this song that the group Liquid Tension Experiment would also quote in their song Acid Rain (or so I believe, they are very very similar). But besides that, there's nothing to dislike about this song, it's just high energy and very inspiring to listen to. Lady of Rome, Sister of Brazil is a short interlude before the finale of the album, Elegant Gypsy Suite. It is a little acoustic ditty that has some very somber playing on the part of both Di Meola and Paco de Lucia, who create a very mellow and light atmosphere with this piece. The album ends with the song Elegant Gypsy Suite, which begins with some acoustic work from Paco de Lucia before becoming a nicely flowing piece, with a great bassline from Anthony Jackson and some great underlying percussion from Mingo Lewis. As with all the tracks on the album, Di Meola is nothing short of brilliant, who really creates some gentle yet rough riffs on this piece, as well as gentle and incredibly complicated leads that utilize a nice wah/phaser effect. Throughout the 9 minutes of the track, there is a great sense of evolution and progression, and I never really tire of this stellar piece.In the end, Elegant Gypsy is right up there with Bill Bruford's One of a Kind as one of my favorite records in the jazz rock genre. There's a lot of excellent musicianship, killer songs, great arrangements, and an overall spectacular feel I get from this album. As I said in my opening paragraph, fans of guitar oriented music and highly technical jazz rock will probably be right at home with this album. I can't call this album anything less than a masterpiece and I am very impressed with this album. You probably won't be either. 5/5."

Another latin fusion masterpiece.\"Flight over Rio\" sets the album off with it's bombastic bridge of guitar/keyboard interplay, followed by the part-mellow-part-heavy \"Midnight Tango\", with it's great percussive ending featuring steel drums and congas. \"Mediterranean Sundance\" gives the album it's rightful title with a sort of \"rumba flamenca\", starring also the one and only Paco De Lucia with his usual flamenco magic. And what about the quasimetal \"Race with the Devil On Spanish Highway\"?... not bad latin metal fusion, and though not exactly my favourite song it fits well. An awfully short bossa \"Lady Of Rome, Sister Of Brazil\" follows (which could had gone a bit longer) and then the title track suite ends the album in style.I would also like to give high praise to the musicians that appeared on this album, particularly bassist Anthony Jackson who reminds a lot to Stanley Clarke at times with the power chords.I'll give 5 stars to this one, and I'm pretty sure it's not the only one I'd be giving to this superb musician's discography."

The song ends as it began. Nice. \"Midnight Tango\" is a change of pace. It's a jazzy tune with some great percussion from Lenny White towards the end.\"Mediterranean Sundance\" has a Spanish flavour to Al's guitar playing that is fast and intricate. Some great leads ! \"Race With Devil On Spanish Highway\" features some light speed guitar playing from DiMeola that is contrasted with his almost soaring melodies. Great tune ! \"Lady Of Rome Sister Of Brazil\" is a short acoustic song. \"Elegant Gypsy Suite\" features some cool percussion and great bass playing while the guitar melodies 5 minutes in shine.Easily 4 stars. Again i'm so impressed at how smooth DiMeola's playing is when he's playing so fast. It's like he has the ability to slow it all down in his mind and it seems so effortless on his part. Amazing ! And he has surrounded himself with some very talented musicians. Highly recommended."

He can play a ridiculous number of notes per second yet he plays with a musicality seldom rivalled by the genre he helped to inspire. Elegant Gypsy shows Al in his prime, with an intractable lineup featuring flamenco god Paco De Lucia and Mahavishnu organ grinder Jan Hammer. The result is a blazing set of fusion that is over far too soon.\"Flight Over Rio\" starts off with guitar and keyboard interplay that sets teh foundation for the boys in Dream Theater to pick up a decade later. \"Midnight Tango\" eases off the throttle brings an island vibe with steel drums and congas. This song shows the elegant side of the gypsy. \"Mediterranean Sundance\" features Paco keeping pace with Al as the two play lighting-fast flamenco. \"Race With the Devil on tehSpanish Highway\" is the highlight of the album with a great bass part, latin rhythms and mind-blowing performances from DiMeola. \"Lady Of Rome Sister Of Brazil\" is an interlude that leads up to the fianle, \"Elegant Gypsy Suite.\" Think that the album so far has been challenging? You've heard nothing yet. De Lucia and DiMeola lay down impossibly complex riffs using God knows how many effects, and Jan Hammer's solo is one of his finest performances. This epic track alone is worth the price of the album, which is nicely quite cheap.If you are a fan of prog, fusion, or even just the guitar, get this album. Al seamlessly fuses jazz, latin music, and guitar-based rock into one of the three best fusion albums of all time (the other two being Mahavishnu's Birds of Fire and Bruford's One of a Kind). Al Di Meola is one of those rare guitarists who can both inspire players and discourage them, as the talent he displays can shame 99% of the world's guitarists.Grade: A"

          "text": "3.5 stars really!!Second solo album by the Italian-origined American guitarist who had a strong Spanish desire, Elegant Gypsy is usually regarded as his best solo album, even if this writer begs to differ! Indeed, EG draws on the same kind of fusion jazz-rock of Return To Forever, crossed with Santana's better moments (from Caravanserai to Borboletta) and Mahavishnu Orchestra's first period. Graced with a typical tasteless romantic late 70's artwork (the disastrous and XXX fantasy of Gypsy women portrayed by Carmen the group), Stevie Nicks, the Wilson sisters of Heart and more), this album is nevertheless a real strong outing, although a bit too close to the previous Midnight Sun.Flight over Rio cannot escape comparison with Santana, mostly due to the Latin-fusion percussions, but ADM's guitar tone is a bit too resembling also. Midnight Tango starts out well enough, but by mid-track it can't escape a cheesy fondue moments (although it could please some progheads) that lasts the rest of the track, until an atrocious (well ill-advised) pzercussion solo, that's been done better elsewhere. Mediterranean Sundance is a Flamenco piece, where ADM tries to impress (he gets by), but obviously is nowhere Paco DeLucia. I'm not sure this type of choice is judicious to ADM's career.On the flipside, Race With the Devil is another Santana-inflicted track that seems to be what ADM does best. A fairly insignificant acoustic guitar short piece follows, then the album plunges into the title track suite, which is need the album's highlight with Flight Over Rio. On this track, we approach the perfection of the debut album's title track. Definitely not quite as interesting as the Midnight Sun debut album, EG is still an interesting and worthy JR/F album that should easily find its place on your shelves, but it should remain a lesser work of the genre."

Rare is the album that I enjoy EVERY time it comes on: this is great Latin and jazz rock, perfect if you are concentrating on something else and simply want something to keep up your spirits, or excellent if you want to listen closely and hear as tight a group of musicians as you can find. Great job, Al di Meola and company for this spectacular collection of music.Flight Over Rio. Bookended by a great funky groove, the middle is dominated by wonderful synth and guitar interplay. Not to be forgotten is the percussion--liveliness and originality without detracting from the other elements.Midnight Tango. From the title and opening melody, you may think this is the mellow tune of the album. Not so! The whole song is highlighted by stately and captivating bass tones, with a great guitar harmony to close things out. I really don't know what the percussion deal at the end is for, but I don't mind it. Possibly the album's one flaw.Mediterranean Sundance. A mesmerizing duet between Meola and Paco De Lucia, this tune is very repetitive and wears thin over time with repeated listens, but you can't deny that awesome melody and astounding playing.Race With Devil on Spanish Highway. Here the band is tight as they can be: fast, furious, slow, and all the while foot-tapping and memorable. An odd song structure, but memorable all the way through.Elegant Gypsy Suite. The boys saved the best for last. This seems a bit aimless, but even though it's not necessarily building to a grand finale, the process of getting there is wonderful. Staccato guitar and keyboard sometimes, and tasteful sustains and vibrato in others, with perfectly effective percussion throughout, this is an absolute gem.If you have any inclinations for great guitar that is well-integrated into the music played by talented musicians, you simply need this album. Ditto if you enjoy jazz or Latin-influenced rock."

          "text": "Amazing prog infused jazz fusion.Elegant Gypsy is a fantastic record featuring some of the best songs of Di Meola's career. First you'd struggle to find a better collection musicians,Di Meola absolutely shreds - tastefully of course, the drums are first rate, particularly the percussion and the keys take turns shredding with the guitar, a very skilled bunch of musicians.As far as highlights go there are a great deal of them, the opening song 'Flight Over Rio' starts off fairly before kicking into overdrive with some latin fusion shred driven by some fantastic percussion with some extraordinary guitar work from Di Meola complimented by the keyboards perfectly with some tag team soloing. Midnight Tango is also a great song it's really quite progressive, I thought it was several different songs on my first listen. Mediterranean Sundance is undoubtedly Di Meola's most well known song featuring finger picking acoustic virtuoso Paco De Lucia (who would later feature in Di Meola's guitar trio along with John McLaughlin - their live version of the song is something else.) Mediterranean Sundance is probably one of the best songs ever written for acoustic guitar, Di Meola and De Lucia are in perfect harmony and pretty well take their turns melting the fretboard with their emotionally charged fusion shred. The closing track 'Elegant Gypsy Suite' is easily the best song on the album, truly a progressive song, covering many different emotional and musical territories, it's a fantastic song and a crowning achievement on the album.Overall Elegant Gypsy is a fine jazz fusion record, it could be a bit longer and it does lose a lot of it's zest after the first few songs but it's an essential part of any jazz fusion fan's collection."

Album starts with Flight over Rio a typical DiMeola latin fusin music with a lot of percussions played by Mingo Lewis, this is the first track to remember. The second piece that worth investigate is the best from here , Race With the Devil - Al Dimeola at his best, nothing more.The drums are absolute stunning and very sophisticated sometimes, and sometimes very smooth. The rest of the tracks are also good jazz fusion latin flamenco orientated that must plesed every prog fan, not only jazz lovers. In the end 5 stars for this one.

Allthough this album is in the same spanish style jazz/ fusion genre as most of this nineties albums it\ufffds a bit more intense and generally faster paced. It\ufffds something I think suits Al Di Meola very well as some of this nineties songs tend to be a little too easy listening like ( incredibly complex easy listening).The sound quality which is really great and the incredible musicianship on this album makes this an excellent experience. Prog heads not into jazz/ Fusion should take a listen here as this might convert some of you.Tracks like Flight Over Rio, Mediterranean Sundance and Race With Devil On Spanish Highway ( which are my favorite tracks) are fantastic songs, exstremely well written and performed. There is not a dull moment in these wonderful songs. Try and listen to some of Al Di Meola\ufffds soloes in Flight Over Rio or in Race With Devil On Spanish Highway. He is so incredibly fast and yet it sounds great and not forced. This is not speed for speeds sake, it just fits in the songs so well. The acoustic piece Mediterranean Sundance were Paco De Lucia guests is also outstanding and very beautiful.The rest of the songs are not as good as the ones I have already mentioned, (even though they are very good) and of course this means that I don\ufffdt think this is a complete masterpiece even though it comes close.

A fabulous journey to the lands of acoustic and electric guitars immersed in the southern europe seas. A strong mediterranean flavour (also latin in the sense of latin american) is all around the six compositions as the songs' titles emphasize.Al Di Meola offers you all his capabilities he had already showed during the collaboration time with the jazz- rock glory RETURN TO FOREVER. Now all is mainly based on guitars (even tasteful mandolin when it's up to Italy imagery) but you will find also excellent keyboards' parts thanks to a certain JAN HAMMER on electric piano and minimoog.The general mood of the album is a perfect balance between rational technicality and sincere passion, compeltely instrumental and enjoyable since the very first listening. Even in the quieter parts you will feel excited due to the meticulous work of Di Meola. Race with Devil on Spanish Highway is a personal favourite of mine and truly terrific! Above all a wonderful sound's production, very sharp and very clear. No doubt it has been voted the best guitars' based album for 1977.Maybe it's not a prog masterpiece strictu sensu but along with Casino is certainly one of the most inspired records I've ever listened to. Far from being pretentious as many other so called classics tend to.Worthy of special mention the collaboration with PACO DE LUCIA on ... acoustic guitar (what else?).4.5 stars: highly recommended, an essential record in your discography."

Together with Return To Forever's Romantic Warrior and Di Meola's own Casino, Elegant Gypsy is my favourite album in the Jazz-Rock/Fusion category. These three albums are similar in several ways. The most obvious similarity is, of course, the amazing guitar work of Di Meola himself. Another similarity is that the keyboards, drums and basses are all played with enormous skill and feeling. And they are all completely instrumental albums.Many people will inevitably think that this music is too technical and is only a way for the musicians to show off. That might be true of many albums in the Jazz-Rock/Fusion genre and perhaps some of Di Meola's other albums, but I don't think it applies to Elegant Gypsy or the other albums I mentioned above. The music is often highly complex yet somehow very melodic and accessible.A difference between Return To Forver and Di Meola's solo works is that there are more acoustic guitars in his solo work. Mediterranean Sundance is a Flamenco inspired piece with simply awe-inspiring acoustic guitar playing. As I said, I'm not at all an expert on Jazz-Rock/Fusion, but I immediately liked this music. The problem I usually have with Jazz-Rock/Fusion is that it leans too close to Jazz and contains too little Rock influences and that the emphasis is on technical skills rather than melody and feeling. Elegant Gypsy is not just Jazz played with Rock instruments, it is rather a genuinefusionof Jazz, (Prog) Rock, Flamenco and Latin influences. In fact, this album leans more towards Latin music than Jazz, I would say.Elegant Gypsy is an excellent addition to any Prog collection and a great place to start investigating the Jazz-Rock/Fusion genre."

More than any fusion album I've heard,Elegant Gypsydelivers crowd-pleasing jams that listeners across genres will be able to groove to.Highlights abound throughout this album, which features lots and lots of Di Meola's guitar (obviously)-- be it in a sensual legato or blistering flamenco. Songs here have a Latin feel to them, and we're given plenty of variety in tempo and composition, constantly keeping things interesting. His sound is very unique and instantly enjoyable, more so than some of the \"other\" fusion guys who favor experimentation over thrills (McLaughlin-- looking in your direction). Di Meola comes across as a showman, happy to dazzle the listener with energetic displays of proficiency, such as in the all-acoustic \"Mediterranean Sundance\". Support players give standup performances as well-- especially Jan Hammer's keyboards.One thing about this album which I think deserves special mention is its entirely dated production and super-slick feel-- which positively screams 1977. Listening toElegant Gypsyis like stepping into a time machine... and it's great! The campiness contrasts with the musicianship so well that its hard to imagine Di Meola's performances without them. Most would probably find his hyper-fast noodling pretentious if not set against this rich palette of 1970's cheese.A must for fans seeking some energetic, exciting fusion-- on par and perhaps surpassing some of the best.Songwriting: 3 Instrumental Performances: 5 Lyrics/Vocals: NA Style/Emotion/Replay: 3"

I read that shredding actually had it roots in Jazz Fusion, and one big influence was Al Di Meola, especially his album \"Elegant Gypsy\". Well, I finally have it and let me say it is an amazing piece of music. Jazz Fusion at its finest. Al is truly an amazing guitarist, but all the musicians on this album are wonderful. Elegant Gypsy has it all. Soft, mellow jazz. Wild jazz fusion. Beautiful guitar work and electric guitar shredding, yes actual shredding. Some amazing solos can be heard on this album.Flight Over Rio. Begins with a slow guitar melody, backed up by weird sounds and soon a nice drum beat. There is some great keyboard as well! A groovy bass riff and some bongos quickly give way to an explosion of Latin Jazz. The middle section is great, especially the guitar/keyboard harmonies. There are some great dueling guitar and keyboard solos backed up by some wonderfully funky bass and Latin drumming. Things slowly decelerate and it ends right where the song began. The guitar solos are nice, and fairly melodic.Midnight Tango. The song begins gently, and features some beautiful solos by Di Meola over an amazing bass riff, enchanting keyboard, and an smooth bongo/drum beat. Overall, its a fairly slow, song and much less upbeat sounding then the first. I was in heaven during the last minute or drum madness!Mediterranean Sundance. My favorite song on the album. This might be the fastest song on the album, with crazy shred like jazz fusion solos throughout and some wonderful dual harmonies between Di Meola and Paco, (Paco himself shows off some virtuoso skill). In fact this song is almost all them, with very little percussion or anything else for that matter. Sit back and enjoy the beautiful yet extremely fast paced harmonies and solos! A perfect song.Race With Devil on Spanish Highway. My second favorite on the album, (and a close second) starts with a cool bass riff and some random, kind of heavy guitar, with bursts of speed. It is a very progressive song with crazy tempo and style changes throughout, and even in slower sections there are random bursts of jazz fusion. Shortly before 3 minutes one of the shred solos come in, followed by a slower ambient section mostly about the synth and drums. This song also has some of the grooviest bass riffs you'll hear. A little before 5 minutes is a frantic, insanely fast section with dual guitars, soon followed along by bass and keyboards. Nice ending as well.Lady of Rome, Sister of Brazil. A short transition song. Very soothing.Elegant Gypsy Suite. A 9 minute song, this is also the most progressive on the album. Complex, layered, and runs the gambit of music. Anything you can imagine is on this song, and the musicianship can not be understated. They are all great, and each contribute perfectly. A very proggy, jazz fusion song that has some really weird sounding parts. What's not to love!?Elegant Gypsy is one of those rare albums. One of those no doubt five star albums. It is short, but what does that really matter? What's here is amazing. I love every song, and have no problem listening to whole thing straight. There is nothing wrong with it really. While every member who contributed is great, Al Di Meola is the star of the album. He is amazingly fast, yet smooth and can also play some wonderful melodies. While his style of playing may have been an influence on shredders very few have the level of musicianship Al does, and none (except MAYBE Steve Vai or Joe Satriani) have the emotion he does. Again, perfect album, no hesitation.Five Stars"

          "text": "Possibly, the best Al Di Meola album. In fact, it continues music of his debut, but is much more focused. There is perfect balance between his electric and acoustic guitar, between Latin sensitivity ( at the level, acceptable for ADM \"cold\" early works), and jazz rock energy. Flamenco God Paco De Lucia gave few warm acoustic touches as well.I think, even musician list is there one of the best during ADM career. In many places the music is near best RTF examples, just more guitar oriented. Jan Hammer still plays competent moog/electric piano lines ( in contrast to his later pop-synth jobs). Lenny White brings very RTF drumming.Big album plus is very different melodies,rhythms and musical arrangements. All sound fresh and impressible."

In a baffling 37 minute short album, Al Di Meola gets more balls rolling then most bands would in an entire career.Flight Over Rio kicks off with a meditative eastern flavour before turning into a surging jazz rock attack that any fan off the genre will instantly devour. The battle between Hammer's dashing keyboards and Al Di Meola's virtuosity is absolutely stunning. After the astounding opener, the album continues through 4 equally pleasing extended pieces. It covers all fusion ground you can think off: jazz rock, flamenco, tango, salsa. The lot.The most amazing aspect of it all is how classy this is all done. For music of this intensive virtuosity, things are never overcooked. You won't hear any 20-notes a second wizardry unless it has to be there; fast sections are balanced against more laid back parts; heavy rock merges with nearly cheesy mellowness. But it never crosses the line where sophistication becomes kitsch.Rarely does an album both have this kind of virtuosity and elegance. Hearing this back after so many years I really wonder how I could neglect this album for so long. It's not that I was tired of fusion, I must just have completely forgotten about it. Shame on me!"

          "text": "Master Al di Meola takes listeners on a passionate and thrilling journey with humid, scorching days and cool, passionate nights. While the guitar is the most outstanding instrument, there is plenty of space on the dance floor for intelligent bass grooves, dynamic percussion, and keyboard wizardry.\"Flight Over Rio\" Several keyboards and a funky bass bang out the opening groove. With a searing tone, di Meola offers blistering solos interspersed with light, dazzling keyboard runs.\"Midnight Tango\" Hushed keyboards and cymbals begin this sultry yet cool Latin-infused piece. The guitarist lets off his distortion to provide a sweet clean tone. Despite gracing through a variety of passages, the music maintains a unified sound and some pleasant, compelling themes. The percussion tacked on to the end has nothing to do with the piece proper- I shrug my shoulders and await the next tune.\"Mediterranean Sundance\" In acoustic flamenco splendor, di Meola shares the spotlight with Paco de Lucia.\"Race with Devil on Spanish Highway\" This is one of di Meola's sizzling masterpieces, where he demonstrates his amazing skill as a guitarist over a diabolical bass and percussion that holds down bizarre time signatures and shifts. The lightning guitar licks jump in and out. Eventually a peaceful rhythm takes shape, featuring a noteworthy bass line and fantastic lead work. The next segment has a dark riff occasionally answered by rapid guitar runs. The fourth passage is smooth and slick, a variation on the theme from before. Finally, expect brisk and technically challenging runs before the remarkable conclusion.\"Lady of Rome, Sister of Brazil\" This is a delicate and transitory piece with relaxing acoustic guitars- beautiful.\"Elegant Gypsy Suite\" The final and lengthiest track is a more cheerful one, even incorporating some ever-so-slight Caribbean flavors. The middle section features some fabulous keyboard moments over a moody background that has a similar bass riff to the middle theme in \"Race with Devil on Spanish Highway.\" The chilling acoustic guitar thickens the background music, making it even more intriguing."

          "text": "As mentioned in my Return To Forever-reviews I'm not much of an Al Di Meola fan. His guitar style is based almost entirely around excessive soloing which is generally quite common among jazz guitarists. Therefore I hesitated for some time before sinking my teeth into this highly praised solo release. But seeing that its status continued to grow, outdoing even the mightyRomantic Warrior, there was no way for me to simply overlookElegant Gypsy.Listening to this album for the first time turned out to be a pleasant surprise indeed, even though this can't be said about the opening trackFlight Over Rio. The engaging intro riff is very promising but the excessive soloing throughout the rest of the track brings this composition down a few notches for me. Seeing that the first track offered me exactly everything I disliked about Al Di Meola's style I almost wanted to turn this CD off in a haste. Fortunately I continued listening and was rewarded with creative performances onMidnight Tangoand who can forget the acoustic guitar duet with Paco De Lucia onMediterranean Sundance? UnlikeFlight Over Riothis material showed a bigger chunk of this artists' range that never was tapped into on the Return To Forever-albums.Race With Devil On Spanish Highwaystarts with an impressive show of skill from Meola which fortunately doesn't just end up as another predictable scale run-through. There is a very tight balance between the composition work and Al Di Meola's guitar skills that never tilt the cup over to one side. While the short acoustic numberLady Of Rome, Sister Of Brazilworks almost as a prelude to what will unfold onElegant Gypsy Suite!Up to this point everything I've heard onElegant Gypsyhas been interesting and refreshing by Al Di Meola standards but nothing that I haven't heard on other guitar virtuoso albums. Instead it wasElegant Gypsy Suitethat finally managed to win me over completely. Even though this story arc unfolded in a a trueRomantic Warriorfashion where it was the final composition, titledDuel Of The Jester And The Tyrant, that stole the show it only took me less than thirty seconds to realize that I loved theElegant Gypsy Suite! The main riff is a total killer and the whole composition just grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go until the final bang at the end.I guess that there is not point in arguing whether Al Di Meola is a great guitarist or not since it all comes down to personal taste. Still I would like to thank everyone who recommendedElegant Gypsysince this experience was well worth to undertake. Simply an excellent addition to any prog rock music collection!***** star songs: Elegant Gypsy Suite (9:16)**** star songs: Midnight Tango (7:29) Mediterranean Sundance (5:12) Race With Devil On Spanish Highway (6:18) Lady Of Rome, Sister Of Brazil (1:46)*** star songs: Flight Over Rio (7:17)"

          "text": "Guitar master Al Di Meola's sophomore release as a band leader and his most highly-acclaimed album of all-time.1. \"Flight Over Rio\" (7:16) a song whose first 90-seconds always felt to me as if the band were being forced to play through a blizzard; it feels almost artificially slowed down! By contrast the second motif that starts at 1:38 is more humanly paced--enough so that Al is able to show his seemingly-superhuman powers and prowess on his axe. Hearing this song brings to light the fact that I\"ve never really liked the sounds projected from the MiniMoog: I guess they're just a little too unnatural for my tastes. (This also makes reminds me of the fact that I've never been much of a fan of Jan Hammer--ever.) Weird song. (13/15)2. \"Midnight Tango\" (7:28) a murkily-engineered song that always felt to me as if Al was pandering to the new wave of radio- and adult-friendly Smooth Jazz audiences. It's nice as elevator music. it's not until the first riff of Al's fiery electric guitar leap out from the dross of everything behind it at 4:15 that I finally find myself sitting up with any kind of hope. Alas! That one little riff, as magnificent as it is, is not enough to save the song--even when played over and over ? and over and over. Nor is the oddly-tacked on Latin percussion party at the end. (13.125/15)3. \"Mediterranean Sundance\" (5:14) the world's introduction to the fiery genius of Flamenco master Pace De Lucia. What an extraordinary piece! (So which one of The Trio is passion, which one fire, and which one grace?) If I have one complaint of this song it's of its length: a have always felt that it's too long, that the novelty of these guys flying around their fretboards in their friendly duel is just a bit overwhelming. (9.5/10)4. \"Race With Devil On Spanish Highway\" (6:18) a song that takes an unnecessarily long time to develop and reach its form and ease. (3:18, to be exact.) Nice instrumental skills on display but, to my mind, that is not reason enough for a \"song\" like this to exist. All flash and glitz, no guts or beauty. (8.666667/10)5. \"Lady Of Rome, Sister Of Brazil\" (1:46) acoustic guitars (12-string and steel-string) in duet. I've always had quite a soft spot for this little one. (4.75/5)6. \"Elegant Gypsy Suite\" (9:16) an interesting mix of acoustic instruments (guitars and percussion) and electric. Once again Steve Gadd is relegated to things I consider far beneath him--at least until 90-second mark. Does anyone else out there find Anthony Jackson's \"tone-destabled\" bass sound annoying? Al is extraordinary no matter what he's doing but I'm never convinced that any of the other musicians or sounds are right for this. As a matter of fact, I can't help wondering if Al's solos alone wouldn't be enough to carry an audience into heaven. More mosquito-annoying MiniMoog to take us into another super-slowly developing motif (one filled with Latin charm and gorgeously seductive melody--if only he'd stay there!) A song\"suite\" that never really seems to reach its potential. (17.75/20)Total Time: 37:18By the time I heard this album I'd already been familiar with Carlos SANTANA, John McLAUGHLIN, and RETURN TO FOREVER, so I was primed for some amazing guitar pyrotechnics--which this album (and Al's predecessor, his solo debut) more than provided. While many people here on PA revere the work in the 1970s of keyboard wizard Jan HAMMER, I've never really been drawn in by his playing, his choice of sounds or his compositions, so this album loses a little on me when I can compare it to Al's contributions to RTF (which had Chick COREA, Stanley CLARKE and Lenny WHITE), Lenny WHITE (which had Onaje Alan GUMBS), or Stomu YAMASH'TA's GO (which had Steve WINWOOD and Klaus SCHULZE). The acoustic guitar duet with Paco DE LUCIA, \"Mediterranean Sundance\" (5:14) has always been a favorite of mine, and \"Elegant Gypsy Suite\" is impressive no matter how you look at it. The other songs are impressive compositions, technically amazing and performed at the highest level but have lost some of their lustre over the years. \"Midnight Tango\" is elegant and beautiful but seems a bit simple and immature now. It is, however, brought up a notch by Lenny's wonderful drum play. The album is very well recorded, mixed and engineered though at times it feels a bit sterile (and others murky), but it is undoubtedly a wonderful representative of a (then) young genius showing his precocious talents.I'm going to buck tradition here and claim my undying allegiance to Al's debut album over this one: despite Al's prodigious and unarguable talent, the music here just feels too showy, too scattered and afraid to commit to anything much less reach for its true potential.B/four stars; an excellent j-r fuse album for any prog lover's music collection but more to serve as a showpiece, not for the enjoyable musical listening experience."

          "text": "AL Di Meola - Elegant Gypsy (1977)Al Di Meola can be disciped as one of the key-figures of the electric guitar. His style is often referred to and ofcourse both his solocareer and his work with Return to Forever made him famous. The style of 'Elegant Gypsy' moves between three elements: fusion, flamenco and smoothly arranged rock.The recording of this album sounds professional, but I can't say I like it. It does not have an authentic sound, way to electric. The acoustic arrangements are acceptable though. The bass- guitar sounds like a keyboard and keyboard sounds are way too eighties for me. The arrangements are kitch in my opinion. The guitar sound of Di Meola is however very good throughout. His thick Les Paul sound is a blessing.The composition on this album is what might be interesting for the listener of progressive music. There are many instrumental parts on every track and most of them are quite sophisticated, or at least intelligent. It's an instrumental album, dominated by guitars.Conclusion. I won't be adding many appraisal to this long list of enthousiastic reviewers. This is in my opinion a good, but non-essential album. The composition is strong, the instrumentation is good, but it's style is so polished and non-authentic. It makes me want to listen to the classic be-bop of Miles Davis! With wind-instruments and a non-rock rhythm- section. This electric styled fusion doesn't touch me at all. Had the arrangements been less cheesy this would have been a four star album."

          "text": "The musical videos were not yet an industry. The most common were fragments of live exhibitions. I saw Al di Meola for the first time on TV. He went into a studio, switched on a 16 tracks tape which started playing the base of Mediterranean sundance and he played the second guitar, then the screen was split in two with Al on the right side playing instead of the tape....amazing. So when I later was in a shop deciding if buying his debut that was already in the \"Nice Price\" offering and Elegant Gypsy I choose the second.One thing that I've always found bad on Al di Meola's music, specially on the live with McLaughlin and DeLucia is that the excessive technicalities make the music sound \"cold\" even when Latin. It's not the case with this album. Al doesn't indulge too much in solos and fast legatos as he usually does during live performances. The guitar in almost all the songs makes an ensemble with the rest of the orchestration and Al plays fast only when it really makes sense.It's evident since the first song: \"Flight Over Rio\" is based on bass and keyboards. It takes some time before a guitar is heard and when it's there it plays few \"right\" notes. We have to wait for the samba section that's a very good example of easy jazz to find some guitaristic virtuosities, but they are part of the song, nothing self-indulgent . The Fender piano reminds to Soft Machine, too.Several years before \"Plays Piazzolla\", Midnight Tango is not properly what the title says. It's the most progressive song of the album, instead.Now the song which made me buy the album. Respect to the live version Mediterranean Sundance has a long percussions intro that's totally useless as it fades out before the acoustic guitar starts its famous harping in A-. Since here it's exactly how I saw in that video. Two overdubbed guitars, one for each stereo channel for a flamenco-like jazz song.\"Race With Devil on Spanish Highway\" is the most technical piece. The intro features a very fast guitar played in Spanish fashion, then it's fusion with some rock accents when the rhythm increases. The work of Jackson at bass is remarkable, but of course all the musicians must be skilled to play this kind of music for this kind of artist.\"Lady Of Rome, Sister of Brazil\" would be a slow samba but the additio of a mandolin mnakes it sound very \"Italian\". Well, I'm Italian and it's at least 25 years that I don't see a mandolin, however this is how he wanted to sound for less than 2 minutes.The closer is the title track and also the best track of the album. It has all the elements of the previous track: jazz, funky, samba...in one word, fusion. The rhythm is captivating and the melody easy enough without being trivial. The bass is excellent but here Al does his best.Add to this a good production and a very clean sound. This is the album which has introduced me to fusion and I'm grateflu to Al too have open my mind and ears to this genre."

          "text": "Al Di Meola uses Spanish and Latin musical influences to provide a texture to this expansive exploration of his guitar skills. To my ears, it's a pleasant but not brilliant listen, and I think this might partially because it's very much a product of its time; the Latin-flavoured fusion approach here had already become pretty tired at the hands of Santana and since then has become very well-explored, and the production quality feels dated to me even though I imagine if you listened to it at the time it would have felt very modern. On top of that, I just don't find Al's guitar playing very revolutionary, and I'm sure that's because a million and one guitarists have taken up his ideas and popularised them, but I've already heard those other guitarists and I (and most music listeners my age) can't un-hear them before coming to this album."

          "text": "I was drawn to this merely due to the high rating it has received and the plethora of reviews that rave eloquently at what a masterpiece this is. I have never heard of the man myself but it was a pleasant journey whole it lasted. As soon as 'Flight Over Rio' begins I know immediately this is very nice music that appeals to me as a form of relaxing after hearing too much ELP, Gentle Giant and Eloy. It is such an organic album that moves smoothly from one musical arrangement to the other. Parts remind me of Santana meets Hackett and it is certainly a unique sound that is created.The guitar work is beautiful, particularly on 'Midnight Tango' with lovely Spanish flavours, and some wonderful piano augmentations. The symphonic strings are a serene nuance that resonates with my senses, and it gets quite wild at the end with African congas and bongos in a short burst of inspiration. 'Mediterranean Sundance' is permeated by Spanish Flamenco guitar vibrations, playing off some amazing speed picking. Meola and Paco De Lucia are obviously accomplished guitar virtuosos and this tune proves their ability. It makes a nice break on the album after the dense musicianship previously. The crystal clear guitar tones echo in the eardrums and provides a relaxing experience, but one will be astonished at the extraordinary dexterity of the guitarists especially towards the end when the pace quickens.'Race With Devil On Spanish Highway' has an enigmatic title and is flavoured with a pulsing bassline, hi hat work, and a muscular guitar riff as bongos are played at a frenetic pace. This is my favourite track on the album feeling like the type of music heard in the 70s where twanging guitar is layered with hyper paced percussion. The guitar picking gets frenetic later and there is a soaring lead break that spins wildly out of control, and leaves me breathless. This is a master class performance and one that should be heard by all progheads.'Lady Of Rome, Sister Of Brazil' is a short piece after the last frenetic explosion of power. Here we can relax again with twin acoustics playing very melodic romantic music. The album closes on another epic 'Elegant Gypsy Suite' clocking 9 minutes. It opens with some quirky time sigs and a jazz fusion feel. The guitars hold onto the melody and at times get funky, and there is a really nice finger picking thing with some speedy work and a wandering bassline that consistently maintains the rhythm. The guitar work is astounding and is relentless in creative styles, from speed picking to soaring string bends, the man is a master.\"Elegant Gypsy\" is an incredible album of showmanship guitar work and needs recommendation. I didn't expect it to blow me away as it did but it is so good it is impossible to ignore. Good things come in small packages and although this is short it is certainly an excellent example of instrumental jazz fusion."

          "text": "One of the best jazz fusion albums everAl di Meola has been regarded, both in jazz rock and elsewhere, as one of the best guitarists of all time. Even though I could see that he was a very talented guitar player listening to the (few) Return to Forever albums I own, having a perfect technique and flawless musicianship, Return to Forever's music would, in one way or another, eventually turn me down. I just can't quite put my finger on it, maybe because of the huge amount of things that aren't right, but sometimes I just get awestruck as to how such a competent and talented group of musicians could compose some tunes that are, in my opinion, straight up boring.Long story short, if Al could not pull it wile together with three other equally talented musicians, I doubted Mr. di Meola could put out better music by himself. Well, at least that was how I though up until putting my hands on Elegant Gypsy.Indeed, Elegant Gypsy, in my opinion at least, rights many things that were wrong in Return to Forever, such as focus and proper melodic progress, which Al does perfectly here: he creates / comes up with a certain line of melody and develops it to the point it becomes perfect. Another thing which he does way right here and that doens't go quite as smoothly in Return to Forever is that everything gets its due space; there isn't a million things happening at the same time and when that happen they are the center of everything and every other instrument work around that thing (mostly guitar or keyboard lines).As one might expect from a solo album of a guitarist, Elegant Gypsy is mostly about the guitars, but not exclusively. Yes, the guitars do play a huge part here, but so do the keyboards, that, at times, work together with the guitars in a call and response style. However, most the album revolves around the stringed instrument. Al here presents us with a barrage of unbelievable guitar lines and strikingly impressive ideas and motifs.In spite of the whole album being filled with them, there are three in particular that amaze me every single time I listen to them: the guitar lines in Flight Over Rio, which make us feel like we are indeed inside an airplane (and the solo is just mind blowing); the speeding melodies of Race With Devil On Spanish Highway, which perfectly translate the feeling of being behind a racing car, the speed, the competition, the meandering curves. . . It feels exactly like you are in a speeding automobile; and the impressive layers of guitar music in the Elegant Gypsy Suite, which, by the way, is the song that sounds the closest totraditionalprogressive rock.The other songs are quite good as well, but they don't have such memorable moments as those three in particular. Midnight Tango is, as the name implies, a tango inspired song where Al uses his proficient guitar abilities to merge the Latin rhythm with jazz rock, resulting in a very interesting combination of both. Mediterranean Sundance, on its turn, tries and mixes Spanish guitar to already spicy mix of jazz and Latin American combination employed in Elegant Gypsy.There are some down points, however, even though these points actually account for what isn't in the album. First, despite the references to Brazil in some song titles, there is no musical reference to the country; Al limits himself to Latin American music, which in no circumstance includes the South American country.So instead of just mentioning Brazil it would be positive to actually mention it musically. Second (and this is more of a personal thing), I think this album could have been stretched or more songs could have been added to it in order to make it more musically diverse. In any way, these\"problems\"do not actually interfere in the album's overall quality.Rating and Final ThoughtsEven some 50 years ago, doing something new with solely a guitar was a difficult thing. Al di Meola, however, managed to do that here. Merging jazz rock, Latin and Spanish music and, occasionally, progressive rock, Elegant Gypsy accounts for one of the most impressive albums recorded in the jazz fusion genre.If you want to listen to an album that will definitely not let you down, with impressive guitar work and guitar-led compositions, look no further: Elegant Gypsy is what you most certainly need."

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

Powered by stacks of amplifiers, propelled by rock backbeats, fueled with unbridled passion, and full of the spirit of jazz improvisation, this so-called fusion music coalesced into a full blown movement with the arrival of John McLAUCHLIN's MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA, Larry CORYELL's ELEVENTH  HOUSE, and Chick COREA's\n\nRETURN TO FOREVER\n\n. We can feel the intensity in DI MEOLA's playing in his debut with RETURN TO FOREVER, 1974's \"Where Have I Known You Before\", or their 1975 follow-up, the Grammy-winning \"No Mystery\". That power-house formula of dizzying speed, demanding unison lines, and rock intensity continues on the group's 1976 Columbia debut, \"Romantic Warrior\" and carries over to Di Meola's debut as a leader, \"Land Of The Midnight Sun\", released the same year on Columbia. His signature sound, the ringing sustain of a Les Paul played through a Marshall stack is an integral part of al those projects. Guitar Player magazine named Di Meola \"best new talent\" for 1975 on the strength of his playing on \"No Mystery\". It awarded him \"Best Jazz guitarist\" for 1977 and also named his \"Elegant Gypsy\" \"Best Guitar LP\" for that year. Al went on to dominate the Best Jazz Guitarist category, winning five consecutive years through 1981, while also earning \"Best Guitar LP\" awards in 1978 for \"Casino\" and in 1980 for \"Splendido Hotel\". With those impressive credits, Al was instantly inducted into Guitar Player's Gallery of the Greats, becoming the youngest player in the magazine's history ever accorded that honor.\n\nAt the outset of the 80's, DI MEOLA put his Les Paul on the shelf and turned to the acoustic guitar, touring and recorded with a\n\nsuperstar trio\n\nincluding McLaughlin and Spain's flamenco master, Paco DE LUCIA. He returned to his old electrified ways briefly with 1982's \"Electric Rendez-vous\" and its follow-up, \"Tour De Force Live\". In 1983, the same year he recorded the bravado studio album \"Passion, Grace & Fire\" with the acoustic trio, De Meola had a brief reunion tour with his old RTF mates, COREA, drummer Lenny WHITE, and bassist Stanley CLARKE. Though the tour proved that the intensity was still very much alive, no record was released of this powerhouse fusion unit, together again for the first time since the 1976 breakup.",

          "text": "This is a very good fusion album from violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. Ponty changed here for an Xth time some members of the line-up: the drummer and the bassist are no longer Mark Craney and Tom Fowler, but the result is still VERY impressive and satisfying. There are tons of electric guitars, violins, drums and bass. The tracks are quite fast and there are not many breaks. Most of the instruments are outstanding, especially the bass, which is ABSOLUTELY relentless. Ponty & Zavod still use an old keyboards technology here, so that the record contains conventional fusion, but the performance of the musicians is quite impressive. It is never dull and very sophisticated. Again, Daryl Stuermer plays some bland, sober & subdued electric guitar solos, and Allan Holdsworth appears on a few passages. Zavod plays some excellent keyboards solos."

          "text": "Of all the fusion albums I own, there are three albums that really changed my opinion on the genre itself. The first was Bill Bruford's second album One of a Kind, which really opened my eyes to the zany and highly syncopated side of fusion. The second was Al Di Meola's Elegant Gypsy, which opened my eyes to the guitar-dominated fusion sound (and being a guitarist I could definitely see a new inspiration in my playing). And the third is this album, Jean Luc Ponty's 1977 album Enigmatic Ocean. His style of fusion ranges on a tight groove and some dynamic unison runs and motifs with the keyboard, guitar, and of course his signature violin (which utilizes a lot of different guitar effects on this album, such as wah and phasers). The lineup for this album couldn't have been any better, too, featuring guitarist extraordinaire Allan Holdsworth (who was on One of Kind, ironically). Future Zappa alumni Allan Zavod also gets a good go on this album (Ponty was himself a Zappa alumni so the connection to Zappa is extended a bit more) on the keyboards. And Daryl Stuermer (of future Genesis fame) gives a nice performance overall alongside Holdsworth on the guitar.The album opens with a short but sweet Overture, which sort of sets the mood in a way to what the album would sound like. The Trans-Love Express starts off the journey with a fantastic bass performance from Ralph Armstrong (who is superb throughout the entire album). The tight groove in the rhythm section is further augmented by various runs and melody lines from Ponty and Holdsworth. Mirage begins with guitar arpeggios and some underlying mixed percussion (as well as well-timed bass harmonics). Ponty's violin utilizes a phased effect on this track and his budding experimentation with effects proves to be most effective. Zavod's keyboard solo make good use of the keyboard and has a sensational floating feel to it. The first of two suites on the album is the title track of Enigmatic Ocean (which is spread out over four parts), which clocks in at a bit over 12 minutes. It begins with an atmospheric keyboard laden introduction that turns into an arpeggio based keyboard motif. This song is also the first to feature some lead guitar work from Holdsworth, who exchanges licks with Ponty at many points of the song itself. Holdsworth's signature style of very noodly and fluid runs comes through with flying colors on this piece as well. It's a fantastic piece in the end, with every musician giving their best and coming through successfully as well.Nostalgic Lady and the second suite The Struggle of the Turtle to the Sea round out the album with more fantastic instrumental performances. Nostalgic Lady has one of the most addictive bass lines I've ever heard, especially when put as a counter melody with the stellar unison guitar/violin work. It's probably my favorite non-suite track of the album and it really is a perfect blend of melody and cohesiveness. The Struggle of the Turtle to the Sea is the second suite of the album, this one running a bit over 13 minutes. It begins with a tight groove from the rhythm unit, an underlying unison guitar theme and a violin lead on top of it all. The second part opens with a brilliant piano motif from Allan Zavod and some superb guitar from Stuermer and Holdsworth. The song ends with a fantastic bass groove (man Armstrong can really play the bass). Armstrong puts on the distortion in the middle of the song and offers a solid bass solo. The song reaches a fantastic climax when from what I can grasp Stuermer gets a chance in the spotlight and offers up a mean guitar solo (you can actually tell it's Stuermer as he and Holdsworth have terribly different soloing styles). In the end, this piece finishes off the album in epic fashion and is one of best fusion pieces I've ever heard.Overall, I'd rank Enigmatic Ocean amongst my top three fusion albums ever. Everything about this album is perfect, from the stellar overall mix and sound, to the fantastic musicianship (fantastic is actually an understatement). If you're looking for high energy and melodic fusion, then you'll find a lot to like about this album. If you're a fan of the violin, then this album also comes with a high recommendation. Actually, I'd recommend this album for anybody who is just getting into fusion and for those who are into fusion but don't know who Jean-Luc Ponty is. Masterliness. 5/5."

          "text": "A Masterpiece of Jazz-Rock!This is another favorite of mine in terms of Jean-Luc Ponty solo album. In this album, Ponty expresses his musical talents into more free-form style with more exploration and experimentation of rock. Obviously there must be jazz components in each of this composition because that is his roots in his musical direction. Ponty gives good balance in terms of featuring soloist in each segment of the music. This is to say that he is not ego centric and putting all solos under his virtuosity. Musicians involved in this album have high standards in their respective instrument. Who does not know Allan Holdsworth where his guitar playing style has been copied or referred by many guitarists in the world. Daryl Stuermer has been popular with his involvement in Genesis tour where he plays guitar. Ralphe Armstrong is an excellent bass player. Allan Zavod is an excellent synthesizer / keyboard player, and also Steve Smith in drumming. All great players plus great compositions become this album is a masterpiece of jazz-rock fusion that proggers must own the album.The album begins with an OVERTURE (0:47) that sets the overall tone of the album, followed with THE TRANS-LOVE EXPRESS (3:56). This track indicates excellent works of bass guitar (tight bass lines), guitar solo and violin solo.The epic and album title ENIGMATIC OCEAN (Part I - IV) is truly a great jazz-rock composition with excellent movements from one part to another. The music is dynamic and it combines jaw dropping drum work of Steve Smith and tight bass lines by Ralphe Armstrong which flow in relatively fast tempo, accompanying the guitar solo and stunning violin work. It's a masterpiece progressive music where all shifts in tempo and style are performed in speed. My adrenalin pumps faster when I'm listening to this track. This is what I perfectly expect from any jazz-rock fusion outfit. The music then moves into medium tempo one with tight bass lines, featuring guitar work. The tempo then moves into faster one with nice musical breaks - after long guitar and violin solos. It's really a superb epic!NOSTALGIC LADY (5:20) gives musical breaks after long hard driving rhythm section and stunning solo of the epic ENIGMATIC OCEAN. The tempo is slowing down, guitar and electric violin demonstrate the solo excellently. The music moves gradually into higher tones with more textures of the music through violin and guitar solo and fills. This is a nice thread as we can hear Allan Holdsworth as well as Jean-Luc Ponty solo intertwiningly. Jean-Luc Ponty also plays grand piano at this track.STRUGGLE OF THE SEA TURTLE is a contemporary jazz rock fusion at its best! It opens with a mellow part featuring violin solo and dynamic bass lines. The music moves in crescendo and brings more complex arrangements to the music. Allan Zavod provides his keyboard solo wonderfully during part 1. The music reminds me to Chick Corea's Return To Forever - with different style. Great violin solo as well as great bass guitar lines and solo are demonstrated clearly at this track. I think this track is one of the best jazz-rock fusion songs I have ever heard. It's so energetic and so captivating.Overall, I have no complaint at all about this album and I think this album deserves five star rating. It has strong songwriting, excellent performance and tight composition in which all tracks seem like tied into one cohesive whole. It's highly recommended.Keep on proggin' ..!Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW"

          "text": "Jean-Luc Ponty has quite the pedigree, having played on \"Hot Rats\" by ZAPPA and \"Visions Of The Emerald Beyond\" by MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA.This record is not out of place among those great albums.After the less than a minute opener \"Overture\", we have the uptempo \"The Trans-Love Express\" with the focus on the violin (surprise !) as well as some good bass and a guitar solo from Daryl Stuermer. \"Mirage\" has such a good beat to it, the drums are great throughout this song.The guitar melody is pretty cool too. \"Enigmatic Ocean\" is a four part song that begins with synths, followed by violin that just seems to build.\"PartII\" features aggressive violin in an uptempo passage that is replaced by guitar followed by a synth run. A chance for the guys to each show their stuff. \"Part III\" has more guitar and violin, while \"Part IV\" sounds awesome with the violin melodies and more amazing drumming. \"Nostaligic Lady\" opens with piano and violin, but the drums and violin carry the song. Another good one ! \"The Struggle Of The Turtle To The Sea\" opens with \"Part I\", a slower paced song (it's turtles !) featuring drums, violin and synths.\"Part II\" opens with piano and \"Part III\" is a jazzy tune , and check out the guitar solo from Allan Holdsworth !There are so many solos on this record and the drumming really surprised me, all the guys play amazing !"

First, notice 2 big names on Enigmatic ocean, Allan Holdsworth (no introduction), Daryl Stuermer (known from Genesis, Tony Banks solo). Talking about the music, some very fine moments are Enigmatic moments part II and Struggle of the sea turle all parts. Wonderfully crafted album with a lot of keys, violins and with amazing drums. One of the best jazz albums from the '70. I will not give the highest rate because sometimes i had the impression that the musical lines is repeting, but not in so big cantity to make a Collectors/fans only album. So my rate is 3.5 rounded to 4. Recommended"

          "text": "Enigmatic Ocean seems a happy merging between jazz fusion, disco, and funk. This is all catchy, upbeat, and entertaining stuff, but it all sounds a bit the same, and as this was released in 1977, I don't hear much in the way of progressing from what has been done before. That's not as much of a downside as it may seem, because Ponty and company don't seem to be possessed by the need for the often pompous, silly, and spastic previous contributions to the genre: these guys just seem to enjoy laying down a nice groove and taking it from there.Overture/Trans-love Express, Mirage. A foot-tapping, catchy set of opening songs, these numbers provide a nice glimpse of what is to come: infectious rhythms (though not terribly original), lots of violin (certainly well-played), and some sporadic blasts of guitar and synthesizer to spice things up.Enigmatic Ocean (I-IV). The opening and closing segments are almost identical, playing the catchy main theme, though both seem to serve as conduits for the middle sections. Part II really kicks things up (almost to Mahavishnu Orchestra territory) in a good way: everyone is firing on all cylinders, though spectial mention goes to Smith's inspired drumming and some blistering work by Holdsworth. Part III dies down for a funky groove that works nicely, and again Holdsworth steals the show. Now I know what all the fuss regarding his abilities is about!Nostalgic Lady. This is a short break between the extended pieces, but certainly not to be forgotten. Holdsworth and Ponty work back and forth between gorgeous guitar/violin harmonies and back-and-forth soloing.The Struggle of the Turtle to the Sea (I-III). Probably the proggiest moments of the album are found here, though they don't stray far from the basic template. Zavod and Armstrong (synths and bass, respectively) get a bit more of a workout here, but by now there is a bit of same-ness to the music. This piece isn't inferior to the rest of the album, but it also adds little to what has been done before.All in all, this is nice music, and worth your money. It's great to put on for company or while attending to work or chores, and it also has a very well-produced, full sound. The downside is a lack of creativity and originality, which is why four stars for me seems to be the upper limit for Enigmatic Ocean."

          "text": "An Ocean of Jazz Rock DelightsEnigmatic Ocean is not simply a solo work by grand violin player Jean-Luc Ponty, the album presents a whole band full of very talented and famous musicians from the jazz rock realm, each musician being as unique and as vital as Jean-Luc is for the music that Enigmatic Ocean offers, so it's definitely a group work rather than a solo work which I'm going to talk about.First I'll talk about Allan Zavod, while not as reknown as any of the other members on board, his singular keyboard delivery is by every means one of the aspects that makes Enigmatic Ocean such an addictive and great jazz rock record. Zavod is the responsible of creating that marvellous floating atmosphere all through the album which no other jazz rock record features; Allan is indeed a subtle player but that's what makes his presence on the album so indispensable, Ponty didn't want an excentric keyboard player who could play extreme synth solos, he wanted someone that could pull-off a particular ambience to the whole album, while of course giving out some ocassional solos. Notable proof of Zavod's unique presence is the 12 minute suite entitled Enigmatic Ocean.Then there's Ralphe Armstrong, member of the second line-up of the Mahavishnu Orchestra. His playing on this album is absolutely outstanding but foremost it's very on top of the mix making him also an essential part of the music. He delivers lots of frenetic funky-tinged bass lines which resonate all through the record, specially on The Struggle of the Turtle to the Sea Part 3 which features a solo by him!To complete the rhythm section Ponty brought Steve Smith, a future reknown session drummer of both pop and jazz artists. His playing is steady and is very ala classic jazz rock, full of fast fills, but let's say he knows what to play when and why.Then comes Allan Holdsworth, the so mighty jazz fusion guitarist of many famous jazz rock records. As he is known to do, he always standouts even if it's not he who leads the compositions. He delivers his unique tone everywhere within fast solos which are only to compete with Ponty's rapid and unstoppable violin soloing.The only member left to talk about is of course the ''owner'' of this splendid record, that is Jean-Luc Ponty, member of plenty of jazz-related artists/bands. Like Holdsworth, he's also used to standing out in each recording he is featured in even when it's not he who is the composer, but this time he is the composer! Varying from melancholic notes to the rapid-paced ones while soloing with Allan which is truly mind-blowing; he is obviously indispensable for this integral work.So Enigmatic Ocean is indeed a group-work, each member contributing their own touch and as a result creating a fantastic and unique jazz rock album which each member has space to standout. While Ponty is not recognised as a fusion innovator in terms of compositions, he actually plays it safe with grooves and soloing on top, the quality of these two elements is simply masterful plus it's distinguishably Ponty and you don't easily confuse it with other melodic fusion acts, and because of that it's a true masterpiece of collaboration between members. Essential to your Jazz Rock/Fusion collection and highly recommended for fans of any of the members on board, also Zappa fans might get a good kick out of this."

          "text": "Jean-Luc Ponty - Enigmatic Ocean (1977)About a year ago I started collecting jazz-rock/fusion albums. The high-rated albums of the genre were of course the first records I tried.Jean-Luc Poty + band sounds like a modern fusion group with a very careful and overproduced sound (unlike Mahavishnu for instance). Every sound is clean, but there's still plenty of space in this recording. All musicians have a highly developed technical style, but don't expect a lot of emotions: this is high quality jazz-rock with interesting harmonies and cool melodies (which is good), but without emotional playing and lyrics. This gives the album a relaxing feel, although some of the solo's are played at insane speed and harmonic inventiveness.Jean-Luc Ponty's sound on electric violin is not very violin-like. Some people don't even recognize the violin when they first heard this album. The electric sound fits in the musical landscape of the band. His solo's are fast and correct in an harmonic sense, but never very daring and experimental. Solo guitarist Allan Holdsworth makes of of an impression with his exceptional solo-guitar style and Daryl Stuermer gives some more aggressive solo's during the album.The drums and bass are great during the whole album, but nothing is really worth mentioning.The compositions have an symphonic jazz style. The compositions have two parts: the main themes with the band working together to get certain melodies and sounds and the solo parts. The latter are easy jazz/funk chord progressions that give the musicians lot's of space to play their solo's. The compositions of the main themes is the main reason people interested in progressive might want to have this album. Some of these melodies are real symphonic prog-like progressions with the typical experimental chord progressions, accompanied by challenging harmonic melodies. Intro-themes of some Genesis tracks like The Giant Hoghweed comes to mind as a good point of reference. The easy themes with solo's are nice, but not all the solo's are that interesting. The guitars and the violin are nice but the keysolo's with a pathetic keyboard sound (typical seventies jazz..) are a bore.Conclusion. This is high quality jazz-rock with a lot's of interesting compositions and a some more solo's of highly technical musicians. This could however never be a masterpiece IMHO. I don't have an emotional attachment to the pieces and the music completely lacks dynamic depth. For me this is a good album, but not essential by any means. Get this if you like the technical sound of jazz with some nice symphonic landscapes and extended soloing. Three stars."

          "text": "In 1977, French jazz fusion violinist par excellence Jean Luc Ponty released his outstanding ENIGMATIC OCEAN. With some ten or eleven albums already behind him, and having lent his bowed magic to influential innovators like Frank Zappa, John Mclaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra, and others, Ponty was a seasoned veteran -- a true musician's musician.With his impressive r\ufffdsum\ufffd, the violinist was easily able to attract a stellar group to join him for his latest solo outing. ENIGMATIC OCEAN features a peerless cast: keyboard wizard Allan Zavod was a one-time Berklee professor of music who'd been discovered by none other than Duke Ellington, and had played in the bands of jazz greats such as Glen Miller, Woody Herman, Maynard Ferguson and Cab Calloway. Electric guitar virtuoso Allan Holdsworth had been a notable figure on the early British progressive scene, including stints with Tempest, Soft Machine and Gong. Holdsworth had also played for none less than Tony Williams (ex Miles Davis), one of the most famous and respected jazz drummers ever. (Soon after his work with Ponty, Holdsworth would go on to play on Bill Bruford's first solo album, FEELS GOOD TO ME, then join UK, for that prog all-star act's eponymous debut.) Second guitarist, American Daryl Stuermer (who'd go on to serve in Genesis' live shows), had successfully auditioned for Ponty two years previously, and had already played on the violinist's AURORA and IMAGINARY VOYAGE albums, as well as on two recordings with keyboardist George Duke (another Zappa and Ponty alumnus). Meanwhile, American bassist Ralphe Armstrong had joined the Mahavishnu Orchestra at the tender age of seventeen, cutting his musical teeth in that pioneering fusion act from 1973 to 1975. (Armstrong also had a Zappa connection, having played on stage with Frank in '75 and '76.) Finally, drummer Steve Smith was, like Zavod, a former Berklee student, had played in jazz big bands, and previously toured with Ponty. (Smith would later join Journey, and serve as much-sought session drummer for a long list of top-name pop and rock acts. In addition, Modern Drummer magazine devotees would vote him the #1 All-Around Drummer five years in succession and one of the Top 25 Drummers of All Time.)With musicians like these on board, it's hardly surprising that ENIGMATIC OCEAN features flawless playing and utterly fluid transitions and interplay. Still, it is the complex, lovely and uplifting music itself which makes this recording such a sheer delight, and an album to revisit again and again. It starts with a brief introductory \"Overture,\" followed by two excellent 4 and 5-minute pieces: \"The Trans-Love Express\" is a fast-paced workout with funky percolating bass, spot-on drum and cymbal work from Smith, an impressive Stuermer solo, and blinding violin from Ponty. \"Mirage\" is more stately. The bass chugs along nicely, but it is Zavod's electric keyboards which especially shine here. Next is the first of the albums two longer suites: \"Enigmatic Ocean\" is a wonder: a four-part epic of multiple moods, scintillating solos, infectious themes and ever-engaging writing. (Holdworth's trademark, effortlessly-soaring lead is a standout.) This is 70s fusion at its finest! The next offering, the graceful \"Nostalgic Lady,\" is another winner, with tasteful fretless bass and slower violin providing a soothing respite from the prevailing intensity. Finally, the album concludes on a brilliant high with its second suite, the 13-plus minutes, three-part \"The Struggle of the Turtle to the Sea\" which easily rivals the title set for jaw-dropping displays of masterful musicianship from all players. (Armstrong and Holdsworth particularly distinguish themselves.) Again, there are memorable intertwining themes and hooks aplenty. This is fantastic listening on a grand scale!Thus, Jean Luc Ponty's ENIGMATIC OCEAN remains one of my favourite CDs. It is a landmark work of 70s fusion and its maker's unquestionable masterpiece. Amazing stuff, brilliantly written, played and recorded -- an absolute aural feast for progressive music fans!"

          "text": "Ah, fantastical titles - Mystical Adventures, Imaginary Voyage, Aurora - promise to lift us above the hubbub to another plane of musical experience - and for some clearly they deliver. As one of the better known fusion artists and rightly acclaimed for his use of violin in this idiom, PONTY gets a fair bit of attention in a sub genre that probably appeals more to people with legitimate musical training. To the rest of us the music does not do justice to the thematic ambitions.A case in point is the closing suite, \"Struggle of the Sea Turtle\". I mean, as well played and even engaging as some parts are, especially the first couple, this is really just a guy playing some technically accomplished fiddle with solid accompaniment. Turtles are among my favourite animals and I'm feeling a bit cheated because it's more like the flight of the bumblebee or something.In any case, this is an improvement over \"Imaginary Voyage\", with a tighter band performance and more focus on revisiting and bolstering themes. The requisite \"hit\" this time is the sultry \"Trans Love Express\", and \"Nostalgic Lady\" is another example of Ponty's crossover appeal. While the title cut certainly has good moments, in the end it's an oddly amorphous and overly long tribute to GENESIS more than a jazz-rock fusion piece.In case you haven't figured it out, I rarely wade into jazz rock waters as I find the style a bit too enigmatic and irreconcilable with its themes, but it's worth dipping your toes into the icy waters of Ponty's ocean."

          "text": "This was the first of Jean-Luc Ponty's true jazz fusion masterpieces (though many will argue on behalf of Aurora and Imaginary Voyage). It's funky (as was the soft jazz of the time) and well displays the virtuoso talents of several of its young contributors--including super guitarists Daryl STUERMER (just before he left to take on a life-long GENESIS/PHIL COLLINS gig) and Allan HOLDSWORTH, bassist-extraordinaire Ralphe ARMSTRONG, keyboardist Allan ZAVOD, and drummer STEVE SMITH. Many place their attention on the title suite but I've always found that I much prefer both \"Mirage\" (4:23) and \"Nostalgic Lady\" (5:24) to the two suites--both of which put on display much of the electronic effects that will become Jean-Luc's signature sound(s) for years to come as well as this groovy, almost dreamy rhythm structure and pacing. This is a pretty great album, but I still hold strong in my feeling and belief that Ponty's best album is the next one, Cosmic Messenger with Individual Choice being his second best--these two having, IMHO, much better sound production."

Whilst the idea of disco fusion might sound disastrous, Ponty and his backing musicians show superb judgement in precisely how much disco they allow to creep in, hitting a perfect balance where they use enough to keep things vibrant, energetic, upbeat and catchy, without going too far into schmaltzy kitsch territory. Ponty also makes sure to get the best use out of the talent available to him, the electric guitar contributions of Allan Holdsworth being particularly high quality."

          "text": "I have been reserving this review at great personal cost to my sanity which kept threatening me with shutdown. \"Enigmatic Ocean\" ranks as a perennial favorite in my top 10, and it will never waver away. This is music in its finest configuration and being a bass enthusiast, I cannot find a more glorious figure in 4 string Progland, Squire, Clarke and Levin be quiet! Ralphe Armstrong epitomizes what this devilish instrument should be played like in an instrumental setting, with a simple tone and a devastating technique that just hauls the rest down the highway! Fluid and explosive, funky and jazzy, deliberate and daring, Armstrong simply shines (I saw him live in red jumpers, he was bewitching in front of 60,000 witnesses opening for Supertramp in Montreal, way back when), bopping wildly in the process only to intensify the bond between body and mind. Truly exemplary throughout this splendid disc in particular, hence I suggest newbie fans to maximize their pleasure by listening mainly to the bass guitar as they explore this album the first time. What a ride you are in for, OMG! Hey, I have done so many times I never get sick of this puppy! A fusion-jazz-hybrid that simply cooks non-stop, fueling barely restrained passions, immense technical abilities and just groovin', baby! Swirling free-for-all is perhaps the best way to describe this genial music, it's positively upbeat and riveting!Then, we get to the nasty stuff, with ex-Soft Machine guitarist Allen Holdsworth showing off his remarkable style, the man is sick with talent, going into oblique guitar tangents one couldn't even fathom, let alone reproduce. I caught myself a few times nervously gigging at his licks, head-spinning technique. Then having the audacity to let Ponty rip on the violin, it's just added gravy! Steve Smith of future Journey fame explains why he is so highly rated by both rock and jazz purists! The man shuffles instinctively and with brawn! The Aussie wizard Alan Zavod is perhaps the most underrated keyboard player in prog, the guy plays like no other with crisp and ornate coexisting on a variety of ivories and synths. Lastly, future Genesis guitarist Darryl Stuermer shows off his talent, a proper foil for the crazy Brit while he is soloing his brains out as if imprisoned inside a tornado.\"Overture\" does exactly what the title implies, a proper table setting with a bright candle promptly lit, fine instrumental linen, a violin napkin and all the cutlery one could hope for. Shimmering and very much an awakening, the Ponty voyage begins, well-propelled and shiny. \"The Trans-Love Express\" gets things cranking, 'bedibeep' rhythm with the Stuermer guitars raging with a wicked solo and the soaring violin, this is where you notice Armstrong's bubbly undertone. It looms, dances and explodes all over the bass, sideways and ahead, a rare combination that the man pulls off with apparent impunity. This is so good, it's frightful! You follow up this rambler with his classic \"Mirage\", probably his most well-known tune and you just know the rest will be just a breeze of utter beauty. Shifting like the windswept dunes, the shiny rhythm just sways as if caressed by the gale, searing violins howling at the sun and warm rays of joy glimmer in every direction. Its sensual, bold and exciting, with tremendous ability to go around, Smith and Zavod just killing it in a sublime solo while Ponty and Armstrong add their own solid imprint on the psyche. This is just so unconceivably tasty music. Then we have the masterful 4 part opus, \"Enignatic Ocean\" remains Ponty's crowning achievement, never to be outdone later, a compelling 12 minute epic in the true sense of the word, a progressive rock approach to jazz that simply beefs it all up with spectacular sounds. I mean Part 2 is simply ridiculous, the speed and precision is beyond comprehension, easily surpassing the legendary Return to Forever's playing, this becomes solo-land with Ponty, Stuermer, Zavod and Holdsworth exchanging furious salvos, while the rhythm section keeps things at a blistering pace. Ridiculous! Then Part 3, revs up the funk as well as the experimentalism, with a tortured Holdsworth in full screeching regalia, only then will Jean-Luc unleash one for the ages. Need I say, Armstrong is blasting all over the low end with some dazzling runs, Smith holding up the artillery? Yeah, ridiculous and absurd! \"Nostalgic Lady\" is where things get a tad more classical jazz-rock, flush with resonating rhythms and that darn bass maniac/magician, channeling both Ponty and Holdsworth to even loftier heights , both pulling off masterful solos, two minds fused as one in pursuit of the aural nirvana. Words cannot give this piece justice, as its more sheer brilliance. 'Piece de resistance, mais oui mon cher Jean-Luc' is what we get with the over-the-top three part \"The Struggle of the Turtle to the Sea\" festival and you must be properly anesthetized because what's coming up now is, well?. Another dozen minutes or so of archetypal musical fusion with so much illustrious artistic expression on display, all seemingly effortless. The 3 part suite serves also as a platform for all out soloing, slithering playing by all highlighted by a masterful Zavod synth anguish (Part1) and Ponty's raging catscratcher, here a hollow body Barcus-Berry electric violin (on Part 2). But it's the final section that ultimately slays the beast with Ralphe's glorious solo (straightforward and with devices) which is just as exquisite as his \"Egocentric Molecules\" assault on the next \"Cosmic Messenger\" album, a screaming Stuermer volley followed by a Smith percussive spotlight. Who else but Holdsworth to put the turtle in the water, free at last?!This album is a must have, you have no worthy collection if this one isn't on the mantle. It's currently sitting comfortably in my # 3 spot.5 Puzzling Seas"

          "text": "1977 sees Ponty moving to the production of albums in a prolific way.Zavod and Stuermer remain among his stable collaborators, but for the recordings of ''Enigmatic ocean'' he recruited also Fusion legend Allan Holdsworth on lead guitar plus he had a new rhythm section, now comprised of ex-Mahavishnu Orchestra bandmate Ralphe Armstrong on bass and drummer Steve Smith, who later played with Focus and became a long-time Journey member.The album was recorded during the summer of 1977 and released again on Atlantic.Despite all these Ponty albums being dominated by a violin-driven atmosphere and his love for Jazz, there are little details that mark each of his works as different from the previous one.This time his music had a strong dash of Funk, more particularly in the short instrumentals, plus he developed his efficiency on long compositions, presenting two pieces, each clocking at around 12 minutes long.So, tracks like ''The Trans-love express'' or ''Mirage'' are mostly played in a Fusion/Funk way with soft grooves, Ponty's always flashy violin solos and the occasional keyboard splash with synth and piano in evidence, creating a happy atmosphere with an ethereal vibe.Of course the self-titled track and ''The struggle of the turtle to the sea'' are more interesting and sophisticated in every way.''Enigmatic Ocean'' takes a step closer to the progressive realms, it has all these dramatic moods created by a progressive band without lacking the intense harmony always present in Ponty's albums.Mid-70's MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA are a good comparison for this 4-part mini suite, which is characterized by its furious rhythms and guitar/violin interplays, featuring lots of extremely virtuosic solos by Ponty, Holdsworth and Zavod.The standard funky echoes though are still popping up, making this a bit of an inconsistent effort.''The struggle of the turtle to the sea'' is propably the better of the two long tracks.While still displaying an obvious flair of Jazz Fusion, it also offers some of the most bombastic atmospheres on a Ponty album and plenty of proggy vibes.Again some funky lines are added for good measure during the third part, but the first two are excellent examples of Prog Fusion, very pompous, professional and dramatic instrumental music with the star of Holdsworth shining through and Zavod making one of his most convincing performances ever.Solid Jazz Fusion, a bit held down by the mass of period Funk appearing in the process.It's still very competitive, intricate and at times fascinating instrumental stuff with the standard violin washes of Ponty.Recommended."

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "name": "JEAN-LUC PONTY",
      "genre": "Jazz Rock/Fusion",
      "country": "France",
      "biography": "Born  29 September 1942 (Avranches, France)\n\nJEAN-LUC PONTY isn't only a virtuoso violinist but also one of the greatest Fusion composers who blended different genres with great success and a pioneer of the electric violin, his solo works include very different albums as the brilliant and almost symphonic \"Aurora\" or the less inspired Afro Jazz oriented \"Tchokola\", in other words not only a prolific but also a very eclectic and talented Progressive musician.\n\nJEAN-LUC PONTY started his violin studies at the age of five with his father who was Director of the school of music in Avranches and a violin teacher as well, at the age of 13 left school to fully dedicate to the music, later (At the age of 15) was admitted in the Paris Conservatoire graduating two years later with the institution's highest award, Premier Prix.\n\nBeing Classical trained, joined CONCERTS LAMOUREUX ORCHESTRA where due to the influence of some friends got interested in Jazz. Incredibly his first works in Jazz were done playing the tenor Saxophone until 1962 when he returned to his first love the violin.\n\n1969 was an important year for the 27 old musician who joins\n\nFrank ZAPPA\n\nfor the release of \"Hot Rats\" nd then THE\n\nGeorge DUKE\n\nTRIO for about a year. In  1970 returns to France in order to form The JEAN-LUC PONTY EXPERIENCE until 1972 when comes back to USA to rejoin THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION.\n\nIn 1974 he's recruited BY JOHN MCLAUGHLIN'S\n\nMAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA\n\nwith whom he releases \"Apocalypse\" and \"Visions of Emerald Beyond\" playing a very important role in  both albums.\n\nEven though he made a lot of independent projects before (like \"Jazz Long Playing\" in 1964, \"Sunday\" Walk 1967 or \"The Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio\" in 1969) plus combined efforts with STEPHANE GRAPPELLI and many others\n\nHis Progressive solo career starts in December 1975  with the first of four amazing releases, the incredible \"Aurora\" an album in which he blends perfectly not only Jazz and Progressive Rock as most Fusion artists do, but also adds clear touches of Symphonic Progressive mostly echoes from his early and complete Classical formation, a real gem that everybody should have.\n\nDuring the next three years he completes his essential tetralogy that includes not only the previously mentioned \"Aurora\", but also \"Imaginary Voyage\", \"Enigmatic Ocean\" and \"Cosmic Messenger\", also transcendental for the history of Progressive Rock.\n\nFrom that point he starts to experiment with Euro Pop, Afro Jazz and even getting pretty close to New Age in some cases, most of this albums are incredibly experimental creating patterns of electronic sounds with the help of sequencers.\n\nHonestly it's hard to understand why this great musician has been forgotten by Prog Archives for such a long time, but I think at last justice is being done with his well-deserved inclusion.\n\nIv\ufffdn Melgar Morey\n\nWhy this artist must be listed in www.progarchives.com :\n\nJean-Luc Ponty deserves to be included not only for his prolific Progressive career, but also because his works with giants of the genre as Frank Zappa and Mahavishnu Orchestra.\n\nIf this wasn't enough, he's one of the pioneers of electric violin and probably the first musician to expand the sound his instrument with sequencers.\n\nIf this still wasn't enough, he  explored new rhythms and genres like Jazz/Fusion, Afro Jazz, New Age, Electronic Prog, etc.\n\nJust to add one more reason, he gave a chance to musicians that would form part of Progressive Rock bands like Darryl Stuermer (Genesis) and Philippe Catherine (Focus)\n\nIMO this is part of what Progressive Rock is about, to explore and expand the concept of music as an art.\n\nSee also:\n\nANDERSON PONTY BAND\n\nDiscography:\n\nJazz Long Playing. studio album, (1964)\n\nKing Kong: Jean-Luc Ponty Plays the Music of Frank Zappa, studio album (1969)\n\nLive at Donte's, live album (1969)\n\nMore than Meets the Ear, Studio album (1969)\n\nJean-Luc Ponty & Stephane Grappelli Studio album (1973)\n\nUpon the Wings of Music, studio album (1975)\n\nAurora, studio album  (1975)\n\nImaginary Voyage, studio album (1976)\n\nEnigmatic Ocean, studio album (1977)\n\nCosmic Messenger, studio album (1979)\n\nA Taste for Passion, studio album (1979)\n\nLive, Live album (1979)\n\nCivilized Evil, studio album (1980)\n\nMystical Adventures, studio album (1982)\n\nIndividual Choice, studio album (1983)\n\nOpen Mind, studio album (1984)\n\nFables, studio album (1985)\n\nA Gift of Time, studio album (1987)\n\nStorytelling, studio album (1989)\n\nJean-Luc Ponty Experience (1991)\n\nTchokola.

          "text": "This wonderful record (Hackett's first solo outing) is absolutely essential listening for fans of classic Genesis. In fact, then Genesis band mates Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford assist on the album, with Phil providing vocals for the standout \"Star of Sirius\" (the best Genesis song that Genesis never recorded).The album is loosely organized around the theme of the Tarot (the awesome and frenetic opening track, \"Ace of Wands,\" is named for a Tarot card, as are other tracks), one of Hackett's interests at the time.The beautiful cover art -- which won an \"album cover of the year\" award -- also reflects the subjects of the songs, and was provided by Hackett's spouse, the immensely talented artist Kim Poor, who did many of Hackett's subsequent album covers. (It's a pity that the diminutive size of CD covers don't carry the impact of the old LP jackets!)The songs vary in structure and overall sound much as those on early Genesis albums did, and are all excellent. As Genesis became increasingly commercial-sounding, many of us were heartened by the knowledge that we could always turn to Steve Hackett for complex, uncompromising, beautiful and powerful progressive rock. \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is perhaps my favourite Hackett disc, although \"Spectral Mornings\" could give it a run for its money. Not to be missed!"

Steve actually gets more progressive than GENESIS had at this point in their recording career. \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is another superb release containing some absolutley incredible prog moments that will please all fans who like good music. Steve is joined by some of the members of GENESIS during the recording of the album (Collins and Rutherford) who bring a welcome, strong familiar sound into the recording session. This recording is essential in anyones collection and is best interpreted in a dark room lit by perhaps a lava lamp."

The dithyrambic reviews of the best Genesis album never recorded are overdone. This is a fine album but I find many faults on it. Oh Well! Can't stop enthusiasm without sounding like a party pooper so I will stop here.Clearly this first album has a lot of Genesis qualities (Phil and Mike help out too), but on the strict songwriting issue, Hackett is clearly lacking his bandmates. The ideas are certainly there, but they need the refining and the other's involvement, to achieve the quality of Genesis' tracks. Tower and Ace Of Wands are my two picks as highlights in a fairly even album.Oh BTW, Mr. Bonzo?!?! The stuff Collins did with Brand X makes you sad? Also, if you listen to his first solo album there is some fine drumming but the many of the tracks on it are uninspiring to ... us, anyway."

          "text": "With GENESIS on hiatus following the departure of PETER GABRIEL, guitarist STEVE HACKETT wasted little time in channeling his energy into an album of his own, \"Voyage of the Acolyte\". Even with a rhythm section of PHIL COLLINS and MIKE RUTHERFORD, few could have expected a progressive rock gem of this magnitude. Picking up his cue from KING CRIMSON's mellotron-led struggle between good and evil, HACKETT floors the listener within the first fifteen seconds and never releases his grip, flitting between the pastoral and the powerful with equal comfort and confidence.The opening \"Ace of Wands\" is one of the most abrupt entrances I've ever heard, but it's fair warning that \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" has opened the floodgates of a very fertile imagination. This enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of good judgment: \"Ace of Wands\" is chocked full of good ideas, but it tries to pack ten minutes' worth of music into half that time. Like ROBERT FRIPP or PETER BANKS, HACKETT is no vocalist (despite various attempts to disguise his voice over the years), which gives him a certain freedom to set the mood with different singers. Sally OLDFIELD is an excellent choice for \"Shadow of the Hierophant\", an eleven-minute masterpiece that features the best arrangements on the album. PHIL COLLINS does passably well on \"Star of Sirius\", but he would get better with time; Steve's treated voice on \"The Hermit\" recalls the first King Crimson album, complete with strings and a lovely flute passage from John Hackett.Although there are moments when Genesis is recalled -- the distinctive lead guitar on \"Hands of the Priestess\", a followup to \"Foxtrot\"'s \"Horizons\" on \"The Lovers\" -- Voyage of the Acolyte represents a new and different journey for the Genesis guitarist. Still, fans of \"classic\" Genesis will definitely want to check this out, as it's more likely to please prog rock fans than anything that band recorded after Hackett's departure."

          "text": "This album came about because of material HACKETT wanted to record for GENESIS but the band didn't record them (in fact it was that very reason that caused him to leave the band two year later, in 1977). Despite that, Mike RUTHEFORD and Phil COLLINS appear here, as well as Sally Oldfield (Mike's sister) and John Hackett (I presume Steve's brother, who also appeared on Steve's following solo albums). The music varies from nice guitar-oriented numbers to the more sinister \"A Tower Struck Down\" (complete with what sounds like a crowd chanting \"Sieg Heil\" over and over, but if you listen more carefully, the crowd is actually chanting \"Steve Hackett\" over and over). There are also some more gentle acoustic numbers complete with Mellotron. One of my favorites, without a doubt is \"Star of Sirius\" in which Phil COLLINS handles the vocals. Unsurprisingly this is by far the most GENESIS-like, and it gave listeners a clue on how GENESIS would sound like after GABRIEL (since \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" was released in October, 1975, in which GABRIEL was no longer with GENESIS, and \"A Trick of the Tail\" was still four months away).But I have always had a problem with the cut Sally Oldfield sings on. I might be a minority, but I find it really difficult dealing with her high-pitched singing. Many people call it the album's high point, but I just find it difficult listening. But, still, it's definately one of the best solo albums from a GENESIS member (which is ever more so when you hear the string of mediocre and downright horrible albums Tony BANKS gave us, not to mention Phil COLLINS solo career, which was basically corporate pop sold to the masses - and sold they did)."

          "text": "Until 1975 STEVE HACKETT was probably the most obscure Genesis member, of course everybody knew he was a virtuoso guitar player, but he was only the bearded man who almost hided himself behind his instrument and the newbie who had replaced Anthony Phillips (a long time friend of Peter, Tony and Mike) without having the charisma of the other newbie Phil Collins.The release of \"The Return of the Acolyte\" changed this perspective, this amazing album (the first solo project by a Genesis member) that proved not only his band mates but also the whole world he was a very talented musician and composer.Some people see \"The Return of the Acolyte\" as the lost Genesis album because Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins were part of the band formed by Steve, but that's really unfair, it's a 99% Hackett album, with his very characteristic sound and style fully developed and at the same time an advice that he was decided to continue faithful to his beloved progressive rock and creating even more complex and adventurous music than he ever did with Genesis instead of taking the safer and easier commercial path.But this album also brought him some problems with the rest of the band; they believed he should dedicate 100% of his effort to Genesis instead of pursuing a solo career even when they weren't ready to allow him to take the lead compositional role.Steve accepted the conditions and didn't released another album until he left Genesis, but his compositionscontinued being ignored by the band, it's true that his contribution to Wind & Wuthering was his biggest as a Genesis member, but that wasn't enough for him, so Steve finally knew what he was able to do and the path he wanted to take.The album begins with \"Ace of Wands\", a breathtaking track with the most violent entrance where the extremely complex guitar is the seal, of course greatly supported by Phil Collins with an amazing drum work and his brother John playing the flute in a much more aggressive style than Peter ever did. Radical changes, bells, strong bass and incredible guitar passages are just part of this notable song, the first one of a long and solid career that was about to start in 1975 and still going on in the XXI Century (hope for long).\"Hands of the Priestess Part I\" is a beautiful flute (more in Gabriel's style) and guitar track with that mysterious and haunting sound he developed during his career in Genesis but with a totally new approach, simply delightful.\"A Tower Struck Down\" is another aggressive and almost violent song where Mike Rutherford makes an absolutely powerful bass structure supported by Percy Jones extra bass, and again Steve's incredible guitars mixed with crowd shouts (not sure if they say Sieg Heil or Steve Hackett), explosions and other sounds announce the final section where a Genesis like mellotron prepares for the end of the song.\"Hands of the Priestess Part II\" is even softer than part one, keyboards help to give a bit of light in the melancholic and dark mood of the album but without loosing the mystery and sadness, only 1:34 minutes long but enough to close and complement the song that started two tracks before. A special mention to John Hackett who again plays his flute with singular skills.\"The Hermit\" is another soft and melancholic tune, but this time with pretty decent vocals by Steve and his incredible guitar, this track reminds me of the sound that would be preeminent in \"A Trick of the Tail\" and the atmosphere of sad fairy tales. \"Star of Sirius\" is probably the \"piece of resistance\" a very complex track where Phil Collins vocals sound better than ever, probably because he was sounding as himself and not trying to copy Peter Gabriel's style. Starts soft and gentle but suddenly John Acock's keyboard announces a total change into a Jazzy and violent section where the guitar background is simply perfect but about the middle the track changes again to a soft style where keyboards and flute are again perfect and lead to another complex passage plethoric of drums, mellotron, keyboards and Steve's electric guitar played in acoustic style without leaving behind his atmospheric trade mark. This is what the word progressive rock should mean.\"The Lovers\" is a short acoustic track that gives some relief after all the complex music played before and to prepare for the closing track.\"Shadow of the Hierophant\" an 11:44 minutes epic starts with the characteristic Sally Oldfield clear and well educated vocals (Even when sometimes reaches very high ranges) that makes the listener believe he will be in front of another soft and complex track. A dramatic passage reminiscent of earlier Genesis interrupts Sally's voice for a few seconds announcing that this one would not be another calmed song and then again the soft voice but this time she goes in crescendo as to prepare for an ultra complex instrumental section with an incredible guitar skills demonstration by Steve introducing the listener for the full band section, from this moment to the final it's a sequence of changes and different atmospheres that complement each other and the exquisite and incredibly dramatic finale provided again by Steve playing in his unique style supported by the mellotron, church (or cemetery) bells and the rest of the band. Wonderful way of closing a wonderful album.I'm usually very careful rating debut albums and prefer to investigate the further career of the artist, but \"The Return of the Acolyte\" is an extraordinary album, probably one of the higher points in Steve's Hackett amazing catalogue and surely one of the top releases of the middle/late 70's.While the star of Genesis was slowly starting to fade, Steve Hackett appeared in the firmament as most solid follower of the original Genesis approach to music.Five stars for a wonderful album."

          "text": "People keep saying this was the one album Genesis never released. what a load of [&*!#]e!!! This was the first album released by Steve Hackett and while we all know he did not get enough creative ' airplay' in Genesis this is a ligitimate solo album by one of the most talented guitarists of our time. Do not forget Genesis were prolific at this time, personeel changes and all. Albums were relentlessley released to standing ovations. However Mr. Hackett started to exert his own individuality and what smacks from the first track is that he went head first into collabotating with his peers as well as other notable artists of that time to help create this genuine masterpiece. Never ever to be surpassed again apart from maybe ' Spectral Morning'. There is no point in mentioning each track laboriously showering praise all over them as each one is unique, continuous play and simly awesome. The mood and emotion is unique as is kim Poor's moving artwork. Star of Sirius though stands up there with the great prog rock creations of all time. Five stars is NOT overkill at all nor if there were is six either....."

          "text": "An album to place between A Trick of the Tail and Wind and Wuthering. Not only chronologically, but also in quality; this album tops Trick of the Tail and flats out easily Wind and Wuthering. Steve was gone on his own way before it really ended. He brought with him a few pals, and I must admit that the fact of hearing Rutherford and Collins playing comfortated me. It's like a seal of satisfaction. Before listening to the record, I always thought that Hackett was more like John Entwistle or Ringo Starr. Lots of talent (and docility), but too few good ideas. Man was I wrong.....again. I'm getting used to being tricked by my prejudices. Just hearing Ace of Wands or Shadow fo the Hierophant and I got convinced that Hackett is far, far, far from being just there. He has more than guitar skills (which I don't find particulary stunning), but rather the ability to build a world of romantism and old fashioned fairy tales. The covers shows up the mood he wants. Obviously, the guy don't need anybody to back him up. He stands solid on his two legs even in the early work. Mature, confident and strong. Just like Harrison! Harrison and Hackett had talent that was growing and expanding has time went by. One day, the circle of friends is too tight and claustrophobia (musically and socially) sets in. Hackett shows here where he's going and...it's way more proggish than anything Genesis done after Peter. THIS is romantic progressive rock. No sissies admitted and leave your blanket at the door please."

          "text": "After being \"left out a bit\" of the songwriting of \"The Lamb...\" album (as Banks/Collins/Rutherford said in one interview in 1982) and after the long tour for that album, after Gabriel left, but before \"A Trick of the Tail\" was recorded by Genesis, Hackett recorded this excellent solo album, which I prefer more than \"The Lamb\" and even more than some of the solo albums by the other members/former members of Genesis (including Gabriel). Hackett showed with this album a lot of creativity in songwriting, arrangements, guitar sounds, production ideas, etc. He really could have been bored in Genesis by 1974- 75, and after the success this album had in England in 1975 (number 26 in the charts!) he really could have left Genesis in that year.I like all the songs of this album, but the best of all for me is \"Shadow of the Hierophant \", a Hackett/Rutherford song, with very good use of mellotrons, guitar sounds, bells, drums. Sally Oldfield`s voice is very good in this song. All the songs have \"fantasy\" elements which are in the music. Some of the songs show some influence from King Crimson, but Hackett`s guitar style is \"very personal\". He really knows how to \"make\" very different sounds from his guitars, and he has a very distinctive \"guitar technique\". In the \"Genesis-A History\" video from 1990, Hackett said (more or less as I remember): \"I recorded a very successful album in 1975, but the band perceived it as a threat, and they told me to give up my solo career to contribute more to the band`s albums. I say O.K., if every musician contributes equal parts to the songwriting.But I didn`t have the music they claimed from me for the band. It took me two more years to organize the way to leave the band\". The band didn`t like many of Hackett`s music ideas and songs, so he finally left the band during the mixing sessions of the \"Seconds Out\" live album in 1977.But this \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" really shows Hackett`s influence and sound for the Genesis`s albums \"A Trick of the Tail\" and \"Wind & Wuthering\". I consider this first solo album as a \"first sight\" into the new music style of Genesis between 1975-1977. The cover art by Kim Poor (Hackett`s wife) is very good too. It really works with the sound of the album."

          "text": "This is Steve Hackett's first album. It is his most progressive one, having a bit the old Genesis sound and style: indeed, Phil Collins & Mike Rutherford play fantastic, fast & elaborated drums & bass, especially on the 2 tracks \"Ace of wands\" and \"Star of Sirius\". Collins' drums are comparable to his work on Genesis' \"Trick of the tail\". Steve's electric & acoustic guitars are more in the foreground than on the Genesis' albums, maybe because Tony Banks' awesome keyboards are not present. There are nevertheless excellent floating mellotron textures, and its combination with tubular bells + flutes on \"Ace of wands\" is delightful. The repetitive \"Lovers\" contains moving mellotron parts, delicate flute & acoustic guitars; it is a graceful track perfectly sung by Sally Oldfield. Phil Collins sings on a couples of tracks. The album is a bit melancholic and dramatic, as evoked by tracks like \"Hands of the priestess part 1\" and \"Shadow of the Hierophant\". I think the completely irrelevant and bizarre \"A tower struck down\" still has some influences from \"The lamb lies down on Broadway\" album. \"Hands of the priestess part 2\" sounds much more joyful than the first part: it has a delicate, ethereal and graceful mix of flute, acoustic guitars, mellotron and tender electric guitar: a GREAT moment on this record! Steve seems to sing on \"The Hermit\", a quiet track made of acoustic & electric guitars, peaceful flute and cello: the light pedal effect on the electric guitar in the end, combined with the excellent wind instruments is remarkable! There are some relaxing oboe/English cor parts which give a noble character to the whole.Rating: 4.5 stars"

          "text": "You'll have heard it all before ... that this is the \"lost Genesis\" album, the best solo album that any member of Genesis (or any major prog group, for that matter) ever recorded, a wonderous secret known to a select few ... well, I'm not one to disagree. Yes, it doesn't feature either the vocals of Peter Gabriel or the keyboards of Tony Banks, but Voyage Of The Acolyte does bear many of the hallmarks of the classic Genesis sound and certainly belongs in the collection of any self-respecting prog fan.Along with the Genesis rhythm section of Michael Rutherford and Phil Collins, kid brother John (on flute and Arp synths) and keyboardist John Adcock, Steve crafts a fine album that isn't quite up to the standards of the Genesis albums that preceeded it, but is still pretty darn special.One way of telling that is a classic album is the absolute lack of filler material ... every song has its moments. The biting Ace Of Wands is a delightful instrumental with punchy fusion guitar, some pastoral twelve string, another winning one with bells and mellotron. Hands Of The Priestess, Part I has a beautiful flute and acoustic guitar melody. A Tower Struck Down is anominous hard rocking prog tune with some great bubbling synth work from John Hackett and a crescendo that has crowds baying for blood. Hands Of The Priestess, Part II is a brief mournful instrumental, and the vibe is carried on by The Hermit, a haunting acoustic piece that Steve actually sings (well, he sort of talks his way through it actually, but it suits the piece).One of the best pieces on the album is Star Of Sirius on which Phil Collins handles lead (and inadvertently presages the Genesis sound on the guitar-led songs that are on A Trick Of The Tail and Wind And Wuthering). Most of the song is gloriously pastoral and even when the whole band joins in, it's never really rocks. I love it and as Steve himself commented on Star of Sirius in 1992 ... \"I suppose looking back on it the song was rather twee - not the sort of thing I would record today but ... I think of it as the best song on that album.\"The Lovers is another of those brief guitar/mellotron instrumentals that serves as a fine precursor to the awesome Shadow Of The Hierophant, a monster prog piece featuring the ethereal vocals of Sally Oldfield. If you're looking for great solos and blistering interplay don't come here though ... Shadow Of The Hierophant is all about sweeping soundscapes and gentle acoustic guitar passages.30 years on, there's a mesmerizing quality about this excellent album that goes beyond the sheer instrumental creativity and virtuosity that draws me to most other classic prog albums. ... 85% on the MPV scale"

          "text": "Steve Hackett's first solo album ''voyage of the acolyte'' is all about progressive music. Hackett's style of guitar playing is used to the best of its capacities here and his mastery is inevitable. On electric and acoutic guitars, he lets us into his world of sorcerer and Tarot elements; everything is around magic and mysticism. Also, two of his old pals from Genesis come in and help him(Phil Collins on drums and lead vocals on Star of Sirius and Michael Rutherford on bass) to create this mystic aura around the album. Also, the usual progressive instruments and elements are present, wether its keyboards, moog, mellotron, 12 string guitars, flutes. What is great is that he uses them as building blocks to the sound and textures. A total of 3 singers are present, but really its Sally Oldfield's presence that is the best, on '' the shadow of the hierophant''. This song is absolutely wonderful, with some space rock passages that will let you a dreamy feeling. This album in a whole is a gem, buy it not only to complete your genesis collection but for its beauty. 4.5/5"

          "text": "It's hard to argue with this excellent debut album from the guitar maestro Mr. Stephen Hackett. When I reviewed his live archives album couple months ago, I did mention that for some of you, you might have known Steve only from his tenure with Genesis and probably still label him with something like \"ex Genesis guitarist\" and you might not know what his work after he left the band. Nothing wrong with that. That's the same case with me when I got the cassettes of his first two albums, I still considered Steve as Genesis guitarist instead of Steve as a solo artist and did not play the cassettes intensely. Until one time when a support band of Uriah Heep Live in Bandung, Indonesia sometime in 1980, there was a local band that played Steve Hackett's \"Ace of Wands\" excellently. It clicked me to replayed the cassette. That's the first love I got with Hackett music. I was hooked with \"Voyage ..\", \"Please Don't Touch\", \"Spectral Morning\" and \"Defector\". For me, Steve has produced many great prog tunes that I consider now as a classic, such as: \"Every Day\", \"Star of Sirius\", \"Ace of Wands\", \"Narnia\", \"Clocks\", \"Shadow Of The Hierophant\", and many more great tunes. \"Ace Of Wands\" is a great track - and has become my favorite track - started with a dazzling drum. The intertwining works of guitar, keyboard and flutes are really good. Oh man . this is a wonderful track and it's so uplifting.Being a debut album, it's heavily influenced by early Genesis - not that two members of Genesis (Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins) contributed, but musically I can sense the flavors of \"Supper's Ready\" in \"A Tower Struck Down\" (track 3). You won't argue that the rhythm section is totallyFoxtrot-ized. Nothing wrong with this. I especially like this track during the keyboard solo - it's stunning. Stand-alone, this third track is probably not an attractive one but as this track is positioned in between \"Hands of the Priestess Part I (3:28) and Part II (1:31)\" with mellow Genesis guitar style, it becomes interesting to enjoy. The Hermit (4:49) continues the same style and nuance with Hands of the Priestess with Hackett on vocal. Phil Collins takes a vocal role in the next track \"Star of Sirius\" (7:08) that starts mellow with good guitar fills and keyboards. The music turns into faster tempo with drums and other instruments.The peak of this album, IMO, is \"The Lovers\" (1:50) - \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" (11:44) whereby the first part serves similar to Horizon of Genesis' \"Supper's Ready\": an acoustic guitar work augmented with mellow keyboard. The music continues seamlessly to \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" with a blues-based rhythm and nice quieter passage where fabulous voice of Sally Oldfield enters the music. Uh . it's really cool man .. In a way, it reminds me to Renaissance's music - not because the lead singer is female but it shares similar nuance. In fact, Sally and Annie Haslam have different timbre - so both cannot be compared. But the song is really great and I now remember that this song was featured in a compilation cassette of \"Heavy Slow\" sometime in the eighties. It's a great tune.In summary, this is the kind of classic prog album that you don't want to miss. Excellent composition and musicianship. Highly recommended.Keep on proggin' .!Progressively yours, GW\"Lost in thought in search of vision. As the moon eclipsed the sun.\"- \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" by Steve Hackett."

          "text": "Hackett's first solo album begins with a bang, and ends with a bang as well. You'll find here a very Genesis-like affair, in fact Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford make appearances. Hackett's performances are the main foray of the album, from his acoustic passages, to his electric runs up and down the fret board, one cannot feel anything but awe as this virtuoso plays his soul out. Most of this album is instrumental, but the vocal passages are very welcome and add even more Genesis sounds to the atmosphere.From the opening Irish feeling of Ace of Wands, to the ending jam in Shadow of Hierophant, there is one thing clear, Hackett is brilliant. Ace of Wands is a rocking instrumental, which has a Celtic/Irish feel at first, and soon becomes a mellotron/acoustic guitar led tune. Hackett's command over the rest of the musicians is key, for he has a much more involved role than he did in Genesis. Hands of a Priestess Part I begins with a very Firth of Fith sounding intro, the flute sounding very much like Gabriel. Star of Sirius is one of the three songs with vocal, and it features a catchy chorus, and some very calming acoustic passages in the beginning. Shadow of the Hierophant is one of the other vocal- laden songs. It has a very Starless type of feel, in that there is a long jam that proceeds after the vocals have finished. The music in this one is powerful, and ends the album on a high-note.Overall, this is a very enjoyable album from a very enjoyable guitarist. However, the Genesis feeling is very large, and it would take another album or two for Hackett to stray somewhat away from that sound (he would come back to it occasionally). 4.5/5."

Collins. But, as our famous Dutch soccer player Johan Cruijff used to say, \"every disadvantage has its advantage\" so we could enjoy an inspired and very progrock sounding Steve Hackett solo from '77.This wonderful album features a Hackett who still was a member from progrock top act Genesis but also lost his battle to maintain his marriage. Music is a perfect way to sublimate this kind of negative emotions and I think that Hackett has done this very well, supported by his new Brasilian girlfriend Kim Poor who designed the beautiful art work. On this album the music carries me away to Progheaven, what a wonderful, captivating and varied progrock sound featuring mindblowing guitarplay by Hackett (distinctive volume-pedal work and lots of sensitive electric guitar), amazing keyboard work by John Acock (what's in a name?!), a fine collaboration from Genesis members Collins and Rutherford, Sally Oldfield and Johnny Gustafson (ex Quatermass and Roxy Music) and, last but not least, a frequent appearance of the unsurpassed Mellotron, EXCELLENT AND ESSENTIAL!!"

          "text": "Hackett's first solo outing reached the charts very quickly in 1975 which was proof that he delivered more than just a decent album. In fact, this masterpiece was the start of a solo career spawning the next three decades. Shortly after Peter Gabriel announced his departure from Genesis there was a uncertainty of the future. This was the first time several group members were involved in various projects outside the group. Hackett did a solo album and the quality of \"Voyage.\" proves this was the right decision.By looking at the magnificent cover art you'll get an idea of what's the music like. It breaths mystery. The tracks have been named to tarot cards. The music seems to be the perfect soundtrack for this kind of main theme. Some people call this album \"the lost Genesis album\" but I couldn't possibly agree. Although there are certain links to Genesis, a track like \"Ace of wands\" is a typical product of a guitar hero. Unlike Genesis, the melody lines and moods rapidly succeed one another. It get driven by acoustic and electric guitars but the keyboards add much colour to the sound.\"Hands of the priestess\" is a dreamy soundscape due to the wonderful melodies provided from the flute of brother John. \"A tower struck down\" is an intriguing example of Hackett's longings for music of a more experimental nature. Its dark, yet rhythmic atmosphere was something that was never heard before and till today it keeps on sounding unique.\"The Hermit\" suffers from Hackett's lack of confidence in his own singing. Fortunately there's some excellent melodies in the arrangements which makes this another great track with a rather sad feel to it.On this albums Hackett gets assistance from his Genesis mates Rutherford and Collins on bass and drums. Next year they would contribute on the solo debut of the formal Genesis guitar player Anthony Phillips. \"Star of Sirus\" also holds Collins vocals and may let people think of a replacement of Gabriel for the next Genesis album. Although this isn't exactly my favourite tune on this album, the Genesis references in vocals and composition are obvious. The vocal line isn't highly melodic which is contrary to the excellent melody lines on the other tracks. The superb arrangements saves it.I always listen to \"The lovers\" as it was an intro for the next song. Its delicate acoustic nature suits this purpose perfectly. \"Shadow of a hierophant\" is without any doubt the most important gem on Voyage. I notice two very different sounding parts in this piece of extraordinaire music. The first part has the classical trained voice of Sally Oldfield who does a tremendous job in reaching high notes with her angelic voice.The instrumental chorus of this track is characteristic for Hackett's work. This consists of a sleepy guitar solo on top of some splendid mellotron sounds. The second part of the track has an Oldfield feel. One stunning melody is repeated a dozen times, growing louder and more majestic by gradually adding different instruments to it. In the end you'll get a full blown orchestral sound. What an incredible way to end an album ! The new remaster includes an enlarged version as an extra but it doesn't sound very different from the original. The other bonus track is a live performance of \"ace of wands\". I always wondered how on earth Hackett did manage to bring this splendid track live, knowing there's a lot of guitar playing going on at the same time. But this version is excellent ! Most surprising is the different acoustic ending which is comparable to the ending of \"Moonlit knight\" from Genesis.There's a magical feel to this album, it almost sounds like a fairy tale. Throughout the album the mellotron is used a lot and maybe this is the reason why the album still sounds timeless after all those years. It aged a lot better than other Hackett efforts. Moreover the sound of the album benefits quite a bit from the remastering process. Half of the album has a rhythm section the rest doesn't need one as the excellent melodies are shining through a lot better without. The melodies throughout this album are outstanding.If you're unfamiliar to the work of Hackett I would like to make a recommendation to start with this prog classic of the seventies."

          "text": "Not a lot I can say really that hasn't been said before about this excellent recording. The most Genesis-influenced of Steven's solo ventures, recorded when he was still with the band, it is a superbly constructed album. 'Ace of Wands' is a classic, with lovely guitar work, both 12 string and electric. 'Hands Of The Priestess', both parts 1 & 2, is a wonderfully peaceful and melodic tune, with brother John's instantly recognisable flute playing to the fore. 'A Tower Struck Down', which cuts the two 'Priestess' parts in half, is a louder, more bassy tune, but still effective. Mike Rutherford performs effortlessly throughout the album, as does his colleague Mr Collins. Steve obviously felt, with them driving the rhythm section seamlessly, he could get on with his own work, safe in the presence of his fellow band mates. 'The Hermit' is another slow, moody, melacholic piece, with Steve handling the vocals himself, and not doing a bad job either! 'Star Of Sirius' is Phil's vocal contribution to the record, and a good job he makes of it. Remember, this was recorded just after Peter Gabriel left Genesis, and Phil was not yet established as the band's singer. 'The Lovers' is a very short, acoustic guitar piece, which pre-dates his later classical leanings. And lovely it is, as well. Of course, to finish we have the magificent 'Shadow Of The Hierophant' with the unique, pure, high voice of Mike Oldfield's sister, Sally. I always loved this piece, especially the way it fades away to nothing after the last verse, then builds slowly back up to full volume, with instruments being added one at a time almost. This track also has some nice 12 string guitar on it. I have the remastered version now, which is why I have not reviewed this until today. There are two bonus tracks on it. A live version of 'Ace Of Wands', which is good, but not essential, as it is similar to the live versions on the boxed archive set already owned by many of us. The second track is the original version of 'Shadow Of The Heirophant', which lasts for over 17 minutes. This, likewise, is not essential, as it is basically the same song, until we reach the end, when the instruments start to build up. In this version, it just takes longer to reach the end. The quality on the remaster, however, is superb, far louder, brighter and clearer than the original, with nice packaging. New liner notes inside, whilst the cd itself now sports the original 'Famous Charisma Label' logo, the one the records used to use. It happens to be probably my favourite label of all! A nice touch. All this in a slip case as well. All Hackett fans need this!"

          "text": "The waiting (to leave the band) roomSteve Hackett's first solo album is still held by many to be his best. It was in some ways an extension of his work with Genesis, even down to the \"Trespass\" like sleeve designed by his wife, Kim Poor. The album was recorded after Peter Gabriel had left Genesis, but prior to the release of \"A trick of the tail\". The other remaining Genesis members were reportedly uncomfortable with Hackett pursuing a solo project while still in the band, and consequently further solo releases by him were not forthcoming until after he left.While \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is veryprogressive, with many of the sounds which distinguished early Genesis albums, it is quite different in terms of composition. If the opening track \"Ace of wands\" is anything to go by, the influences are more in the way of King Crimson or Yes. Indeed, track 2, \"Hands of the Priestess Part I\" is reminiscent of \"I talk to the wind\" from King Crimson's first album.There is a diversity to this album which tends to be lacking on subsequent Hackett releases. While he has explored many different styles through the years, each album has tended to focus on a particular aspect, whereas here he throws many of them into the same pot.The Genesis sounds start to come to the fore on \"A tower struck down\" which borrows strongly from the \"Apocalypse\" section of \"Supper's ready\" (or is it \"Grendel\"!). The track also has a \"Waiting room\" (\"Lamb lies down..\") flavour, a track which Hackett clearly favours, since he also included it in his \"Genesis revisited\" project.Just when it seems the album is to be entirely instrumental, vocals appear for the first time on \"The Hermit\". This \"Blood on the rooftops\" like song is comparable with the work of Camel, accentuated by the fact that Hackett and Andy Latimer have a similar vocal style. Hackett is clearly aware of his own limitations in the vocal department, they are adequate but no more than that. A couple of guest vocalists therefore appear on side two of the album. Phil Collins, who at the time was about to take on the lead vocalist role for Genesis, sings on \"Star of Sirius\". His performance is more like the multi tracked style of \"Harlequin\" (\"Nursery Cryme\") than the \"Track of the tail\" onwards albums, and is thus a bit rough at the edges. The track is quitepop, but has some fine instrumental work.The feature track is \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" which is preceded by the brief \"The lovers\". In the same way as \"Horizons\" precedes \"Supper's ready\", \"The lovers\" should have been incorporated into \"Shadow..\" as an integral part of the song. The guest vocalist here is Sally Oldfield, sister of Mike and an accomplished singer in her own right. There's an \"Epitaph\"/\"Fountain of Salmacis\" feel to the opening section, which is transformed by Oldfield's supreme performance. A \"Ripples\" like link leads to a lengthy closing section which features a repeating theme building from delicate xylophone to a bombastic, majestic conclusion and fade. The piece is quite typical, perhaps derivative, of other prog pieces of the time but is nonetheless a magnificent opus.With his first solo album, Steve Hackett showed that he had much to offer. In retrospect, it is easy to understand how he became frustrated with the constraints of working within the Genesis framework. Had Tony Banks not also been in his most productive period, Hackett would clearly have been able to carry Genesis to greater heights himself. Whether these particular songs were ever actually offered to the band, is a matter for speculation.This is a highly accomplished work, recommended to all who enjoy thecoreprog of the early to mid 70's.The recently released re-mastered CD version has an additional live version of \"Ace of wands\" and an absolutely essential 17 minute extended studio version of \"Shadow of the Hierophant\"."

          "text": "3 StarsNote: I modified my rating system. I \"grade\" individual tracks as well now, located inside parenthesis.It is always interesting to hear solo albums to see the musicians' musical expressions that would be limited when that artist is in a band and is not the leader. Here, it seems like Genesis has influenced him all over the album, unless Steve Hackett was a main composer in the band (I honestly don't know). The symphonic nature of Genesis is clearly heard here as well, especially when you notice that Rutherford (bass) and Phil Collins (vocals, Drums) are present. Also, Steve's trademark guitar sound is everywhere. Unlike many, I find this album very inconsistent in quality: Star of Sirius being unlistenable while Shadow of the Hierophant and the hands of the priestress interludes are beautiful. The rest of the songs are decent but quite disappointing considering it's supposed to be Steve Hackett's best album.(C) Ace of Wands: A cheesy and frenzied solo introduces the song which is very dynamic and proggy. The song changes rhythms numerous times, though too much for my enjoyment. The result is a promising, yet slightly choppy piece with great parts and bad ones as well. However, I don't think anyone could call this dull.(A-) Hands of the Priestess: this interlude; with its acoustic guitars, haunting electric guitar riffs, mellotron, beautiful flute melodies; melts me.(D-) A Tower Struck Down: A somewhat aggressive and repetitive piece with bizarre guitars and synths. Unfortunately, it makes me wish that there was a melody present in the song. The last minute is musically pointless, and the whole song doesn't do anything for me.(A-) Hands of the Priestess II: While the tone and style is similar to part 1, the song is not a regurgitation of the first part. It begins with a charming flute that is later accompained by a beautiful theme played on an electric guitar.(C-) The Hermit: A nice acoustic ballad, but nothing special. Any ballad from Genesis in this period is superior to this one. The relaxing outro is pretty good though.(F) Star of Sirius: The first two minutes are charming enough, but that doesn't stop me from giving an F to this song. The reason is simple: one of the most horrible choruses I've heard in my life, prog or not. I cannot believe that it is Phil Collins who is singing here because if that's him, he must have been having a major flu (his vocal performance is horribly subpar). Not only is the singing weak, but the ridiculous melody and vocal harmonies make my parents ask me to please put my headphones whenever the chorus comes up. Skippable song for sure.(C) The Lovers: A nice interlude between the horrible song and the masterpiece.(A+) Shadow of the Hierophant: You can't have an album as inconsistent as this one in terms of quality. After an unlistenable song with choruses that could be used for harsh interrogative tactics, here comes one of the highlights from the whole progressive rock movement of the 70s. It begins with a glorious and bombastic mellotron/guitar punch that is played a few times throughout the song, alternating with folk melodies sang by a talented woman. After that ends, the song leaves room for an impressive electric guitar solo that I consider one of his best guitar performances in his entire career. It is not technically impressive (excluding the lighting fast tapping that introduces it) but it is rich in melody and emotion. Just when I feel goosebumps all over my body, the best is yet to come: a crescendo that would make post rock bands like \"Godspeed you Black Emperor\" shake their heads in shame as this guitar player made one of my favourite crescendos in the whole music world. I won't spoil much, but I could say that it has one of the best Collins performances, a synthesis of guitar riffs,delicious mellotron, and other instrumentation. A perfect ending!Shadow of the Hierophant is worth the album itself, but you won't find more of this quality except for the priestess interludes. The album is so inconsistent in quality that it severely mars my enjoyment whenever I spin this disc. Proceed with caution.Highlights: Shadow of the Hierophant, Hands of the Priestress pt1+2Let Downs: A Tower Struck Down, Star of Sirius.My Grade : C"

          "text": "Steve Hackett's \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is a shinning example of the mixture of band and orchestral instruments into one album. This is probably why Steve Hackett is classified as a symphonic artist. Also the inclusion of synthesizers gives it that final symphonic touch which tops off the album's sound. The album its self is a tremendous success in my eyes, it is an advancement on any Genesis album as it features, in my opinion a more interesting atmosphere. Whether it be the unique sound or just the greater focus on classic guitar I just can't say, but it's just an improvement.The album contrasts greatly in sound and mood, take the opener \"Ace of Wands\" and the following track \"Hands of the Priestess pt.1.\" \"Ace of Wands\" is a louder, more violent song while Hands of the Priestess pt.1.\" is a beautiful mixture of classical guitar, flute and mellotron with some percussion here and there. These contrasts pop-up throughout the entire album and become very obvious after a while. Steve Hackett's guitar styles on this album range from intricate classic fingering to experimental guitar synthesizers, very interesting guitar work.The album opens with the fast-paced \"Ace of Wands\" which features a couple of themes which appear throughout the entire album, played on instruments ranging from guitar to harmonica in a mellower mood. The song its self is excellent and features some very powerful progressive elements including synthesizers, changes in meter and mixture of instruments.The next song \"Hands of the Priestess, Part 1\" is a somewhat mellower song with a really great flute melody played by Steve Hackett's brother. The song is more down to earth than \"Ace of Wands\" but still features little snippets of oddity. The song is a buffer for the upcoming chaos.\"A Tower Struck Down\" is a louder, more aggressive piece than its predecessors and it incorporates the use of odd synthesizer effects. The synthesizers and general sounds in the piece are quite monotonous, but this is a minor factor and will eventually be forgotten. The song also breaks the calm of \"Hands of the Priestess, Part 1\", and it's really does its part well.\"Hands of the Priestess, Part 2\" is quite a short song and it echoes the first part of the song. At the beginning of the peice a new tune is introduced which is repeated later in the album. There is also another tune repeated on a harmonica which sounds very. hazy and good. It is a good revival after \"A Tower Struck Down.\"Next is \"The Hermit\", which features great acoustic guitar work from Hackett and also great string backing which adds to the mood of the song. The song excels at conjuring the image of a weather-worn hermit who is more that what meets the eye.Then comes, the masterpiece of the album, \"Star Of Sirius believe me this is one amazing song. The contrast of loud and soft parts, as well as the very melodic guitar work and woodwinds (cor angelis I think) is amazing. A few of the tunes are repeated during the climax of the song and blend with the total feel of the song like clockwork. Amazing stuff.Up next is the short \"intermission\" song \"The Lovers\" which is basically just a winding, mellow acoustic solo from Hackett with minimal backing. It acts as a buffer before the climax.Last is the fantastic \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" which is another highlight. The piece features the lovely voice of Sally Oldfield who really brings something anyone else could not. The song is very epic and there is a particular tune which is repeated numerous times throughout the song. \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" is a great way to end a truly unforgettable album.1. Ace Of Wands (5/5) 2. Hands of the Priestess Part I (5/5) 3. A Tower Struck Down (3.5/5) 4. Hands of the Priestess Part II (4/5) 5. The Hermit (5/5) 6. Star of Sirius (5/5) 7. The Lovers (3.5/5) 8. Shadow of the Hierophant (5/5) Total = 36 divided by 8 = 4.5 = 5 stars!!Essential: a masterpiece of progressive music\"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is in my opinion better than any Genesis album, but really what has that got to do with anything? Anyway \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" really is an amazing album in all regards and it does what Genesis albums could not. I'd recommend this album to everyone, its great."

          "text": "Well, there are hardly ratings below the 4-star rating for this album. That shows something: anyone could easily get used to Steve Hackett; yes, the dorky shy guy with beard and lenses sitting lonely on a corner at Genesis' concerts (as a musician, of course, not to be confused with another roadie) now has broken loose, or well, just a little bit; he's still mostly drown in the mix of mellotron layers and synthetizers, like in the old Genesis' days; but he's in charge of the compositions now, and great compositions they are, taking you into a world of romantic fairy tales and stories of ancient religions.Yes, it's still in the vein of Genesis (and it's not a complaint); however, he could slap Banks' face with this album, demonstrating that he could live without Genesis' pity.There are two familiar names on the band's credits: Collins and Rutherford (of the same Genesis fame); though they are under Hackett's command this time.So I'll get to the actual review: it starts on a fast beat with \"Ace Of Wands\"; with fantastic interludes and amazing ending, even though they're split together by an annoying and dated sound effect, a low point but it doesn't even last 2 seconds, so there's no point in skipping it. Then we get transported into the suite \"Hands Of The Priestess Pt.1/A Tower Struck Down/Hands Of The Priestess Pt.2\": the prelude is highly atmospheric with haunting chords of 4th's, 7th's and 2nd's, both in acoustic guitar and mellotron; the flute work is superb; \"A Tower Struck Down\" is more electric and bombastic, and you could hear chants and the tower being struck down at the end in a crashing sound, the mellotron laments again with strange chords and then, fading in, the epilogue reprises the prologue with good effect. The Hermit is based in a single guitar riff, but there's beauty in it's simplicity and the oboes bring a sense of nostalgia with emotive notes. \"Star Of Sirius\" is also acoustic-based but a bit lighter in mood and some up-beat moments (Collins fills the vocal spot in this one). I think the weakest song here is \"Shadow Of The Hierophant\"; it has a great melody and is beautifully crafted with Sally Oldfield's vocals, but it tends to be too repetitive and overlong for that matter.In this album there's also the tendency to reprise a main melody in all of it's songs: the melody that is first found at the 2nd half of \"Ace Of Wands\"; evoking the idea of a concept in the same manner as Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side Of The Moon\"; Gentle Giant's self-titled album and Jethro Tull's \"Thick As A Brick\".It's a great addition to any collection of symphonic rock music, and I would recommend it highly to any Genesis' fan before Wind And Wuthering. 4 stars."

          "text": "Well, a lot has been said about this album being the lost Genesis album... I don't quite agree with that suggestion. It definitely has a Genesis sound to it of course but knowing Hackett's other works, Voyage Of The Acolyte has Hackett's trademark written all over it. This means that his next couple of albums are as good if not better (in sound). Phil Collins' contribution on the vocals is not that good unfortunately but the drumming makes up for it ! The only setback is when Hackett sings on the Hermit. However the rest of the album is fantastic. My own favourite is Shadow of the Hierophant : what a great piece of progressive music. Attention Genesis fans : go and get this album if you don't already have it."

          "text": "A very beautiful truly symphonic prog album by one of the most important guitarists in prog. It's the only album I have of his so far and I really can't see how he could have topped it. It starts off very aggressively, which took me by surprise, (I did have the original vinyl record years ago, but I toally forgot what it sounded like). \"Ace Of Wands\" is my favorite song for the simple reason that it doesn't sound like Genesis. It's a tad fusiony mixed with symph changing tempo often and at only 5.25 minutes long, it has enough melodies and themes for six songs! A classic! The next three songs tell a story and are haunting and dark with the third part acoustic and pretty. \"Star of Sirius\" is sung by Phil Collins and is the catchiest and very memorable. But hands down, the most symphonic song on the album is \"Shadow of the Hierophant\". With Sally Oldfield's precious vocals and Steve's wailingly sad guitar, it features super Melotron passages which sticks in your head for days. My copy is the re-mastered version with two bonus tracks, a killer live version of \"Ace Of Hands\" and an extended version of \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" which tends to get on your nerves after it surpasses the original version timewise. All in all, I'd guess this would be the best solo album symphonicaly by any member of Genesis and garners a 4.5 star rating from me. A must have for Genesis fans and symph fans in general."

          "text": "Knowing genesis before i knew steve hackett ,deffinitely didn't prepare me for this album. Although i knew he was a good guitar player that sometimes was not fully noticed ,i didn't imagine he was such a wonderful songwriter and a progressive one too. I guess he was the main guy pushing the music to prog territories in genesis.The album openes with a bang ,'ace of wands' is one of the most progressive 5 minutes song i have come to hear ,it changes about every 30 seconds from the main theme to a second theme and back ,then evolves some more having one of the most coolest breaks in history of breaks. Spectacular bass and some good drumming. One of the greatest tracks by hackett. But the album is not all crazy like the opener ,but presents a mellow side too with good acoustic guitars incorporating some flutes and keys ,creating some beautiful moods. Another thing i like about this album is how it demonstrates hackett's songwriting ability and not focusing only on his guitar playing ,that is noticed on 'a tower struck down' which is a prog song focusing on the keys, also great. The music on the album is eclectic symphonic with very good ideas, some are well done and some are less, like the closing track which clocking at above 11 minutes ,is nice but drags too long for minutes when nothing really changes.This was a very promising debut by hackett ,and followed it a couple of more progressive albums. 4 stars"

This debut album is still justly viewed as a glowing icon of melancholia-infused progressive rock. With most of his Genesis bandmates on board, Hackett is in obviously comfortable surroundings and hence, positively shines throughout the tracks , effusively flowing guitar forays searching for new tonal horizons , dazzling atmospheres wonderfully coloured by the ubiquitous mellotron cascades, rivers of liquid flute runs and an occasional stream of vibrant cello. The supporting cast does well to further enhance the fragile delicacy of the arrangements , namely the pulsating Rutherford Rickenbaker combining deftly with the marvelous Collins drumming (they were a very underrated rythm section ), a burping Percy Jones fretless bass cameo and the glimmering voice courtesy of Sally Oldfiled . The tracks have been already dissected by my esteemed colleagues, so I will reserve my comments to the closer, where the disc spirals effortlessly into the upper reaches of nirvana (no, not the band) , an unmitigated classic that easily rivals or even surpasses any prime Genesis tune, proving conclusively that Steve's departure was the final progressive moment in Genesis' existence. The next chapters of their history has only further confirmed the obvious. Tied with Spectral Mornings but a slightly more precious overall package (Beautiful cover to boot). 5 stars, with \"no reply at all\"."

          "text": "With this solo album, his first, Steve Hackett set the pattern he would maintain throughout his career. Some tracks may annoy the listener, some leave him/her indifferent, some are so beautiful it hurts. To the first category belongs \"A Tower Struck Down\", to the second \"The Hermit\" and the much-vaunted instrumental climax of \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" (melodramatic, self-important film music which takes a lot of time getting you nowhere). With a bit of goodwill, we might state that the third and final category is the one that's best represented here. A good album, then, but not a great one.To be more precise: the pastoral folk of \"Hands of the Priestess\" and \"Hierophant\" (at least the latter's vocal half, sung by Sally Oldfield) feels truly charming and refreshing. Hackett's fortissimo guitar-and-mellotron outburst on \"Hierophant\" will frighten the pants off you the first time you hear it; it clearly shows how much he was enthralled by King Crimson's \"Epitaph\", but it's no less effective for that. A shame, though, that Hackett (or Mike Rutherford - I don't know who was responsible for the lyrics) wouldn't let Miss Oldfield sing a simple love song but decided to stick to fake-poetical nonsense. 'Veiling the night shade bright stalks a flower revealed / Nearing the hour make haste to their threshold concealed'? I don't think so...Silly lyrics are also the one weak point of \"Star of Sirius\", but otherwise I don't want to hear a word against this particular song. It's one of the most ravishing melodies I've heard Phil Collins sing - easily as good as anything on TRICK OF THE TAIL (then as yet unreleased). To top it all, \"Sirius\" includes a mellow middle section for oboe and mellotron so achingly beautiful it makes me want to burst out in tears every time I hear it. Hackett tends to write wonderful tunes for wind instruments; it's something I truly admire. He also has a great ear for analog synth sonorities. On the gorgeous instrumental \"Ace of Wands\", Moog synthesizers are employed to great effect (as well as twelve string guitar, mellotron, bells and of course Steve's mischievous electric lead guitar).To sum up, VOYAGE OF THE ACOLYTE is worth hearing but not the masterpiece of symphonic prog some Hackett fans make it out to be. When pressed, I'd give it three and a half stars. (You may be interested to know that the album's best two tracks can also be found in the excellent compilation THE UNAUTHORISED BIOGRAPHY.) As for ACOLYTE's cover art, I'm afraid it's the kind of wishy-washy fairy tale stuff that gives prog a bad name. (Unfortunately, on later releases the artist concerned was to prove she could do even worse.) Finally - any mixed feelings I may have about this recording cannot disguise that Steve Hackett's post-1975 career has been far more fascinating than anything achieved by comparable figures like Steve Howe or Rick Wakeman. Whatever his defects, Hackett rarely runs out of ideas. Long may he continue to perplex and surprise us."

          "text": "\"...lost in thought in search of vision as the moon eclipsed the sun...\"This album is of a rare beauty. I adore almost every minute of it.The choice to try something new outside Genesis was a winning decision for Hackett. The atmosphere is warm with strong classical influences (a special mention goes to Sally Oldfield her beatutiful and pure vocals), rich of varied and intelligent compositions. Above all, its freshness, that sense of joy and delicacy flowing from all the notes, from all the synth's chants.Acoustic and electric guitar softly whispering create pure melodic structures. Many changing moods from baroque (thanks to the use of instruments like oboe, cello and flute) to dramatic: the couple \"Hands of the Priestess - part 1\" and \"A Tower Struck Down\" are the most evident proof. The second one, in particular, is great, superb, nervous, exciting with those peculiar and distorted bass parts. Not to speak of the master use of synth whose results have bring the melodies to Olympus mount of prog.The album is instrumental for the most part, with some exceptions like \"The Hermit\", \"Star of Sirius\" (which features excellent vocals thanks to fellow Genesis member Phil Collins) and \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" (11,45 mns).The last one, is mainly instrumental and pompous. It reminds me (in its first part), a little, of Barclay James Harvest's memorable tune \"For No One\", especially for the majestic choir mellotron eruptions. That's one my best \"goose bump moments in prog\".Thanks, Steve. 4.5 stars."

          "text": "One Genesis album not credited to Genesis is the first solo effort by Steve Hackett. The album was made after Gabriel had left and the guys were taking some time to try different things before making decisions about Genesis. Hackett took the chance to \"be the Captain\" for a change and this album has all of the beauty and grandeur of the 70s finest symphonic successes. A balance is achieved between delicate pastoral moments and rocking ones, the arrangements and sound are quite good, and the list of guest stars is impressive: Collins, Rutherford, John Acock, Sally Oldfield, and Percy Jones. Hackett notes that it \"was great to work with Phil and Mike in a different way outside the confines of the band.\"\"Ace of Wands\" begins with an uptempo riff and muscular bass that alternates a mellow section of acoustic guitars and synths. Nice progressions lead to some fancy Hackett leads towards the end. \"Hands of the Priestess part 1\" is pure prog heaven with acoustic and lovely flute over mellotron. The melody is gorgeous and dreamy. Occasionally light chimes and volume controlled electric leads make a welcome appearance. \"A Tower Struck Down\" jolts you from the serenity of the previous song with a Crimsonesque harshness to the mood. Sound effects come and go adding drama and unease. It then drifts back to the loveliness of \"Hands of the Priestess part 2\" briefly before going into \"The Hermit.\" The music is very pretty with cello, acoustic guitar and flute. The vocals are somewhat tentative and thin as Hackett was obviously not too comfortable with his vocal prowess. \"Star of Sirius\" begins side 2 with mellotron, acoustic with effect, and a guest vocal by Collins who does a nice job. This track features a catchy pop-ish chorus that gets a bit sing-songey but I find the overall cheese rating of the album to be more than manageable. Let's face it, there's good cheese and bad cheese and this is some of the fine stuff.Some say albums like this are what made Punk necessary and while there is an element of truth to that philosophy, it can never take away the joy that music like this gives to people. Punk and prog can co-exist just fine in the eyes of we fans-it seems like the artists are the ones who have trouble getting along. \"The Lovers\" is a short instrumental introduction to the real highlight of the album, the magnificent \"Shadow of the Hierophant.\" This has to be one of symphonic prog's greatest moments. I am captivated by the yearning beauty of the main melody that keeps finding its way back, seemingly more passionate each time. And then there is the angelic beauty of Oldfield's vocal which just makes my heart burst. The louder parts trade off with soft passages of mellotron, acoustic guitar, and flute. There are some pleasant electric leads peeled off now and again. Some have complained the track is a bit sweet and this is true but what can I say? Sometimes a particular piece of songwriting catches you in its spell and other times definitely not. I find it completely charming and spellbinding.I would highly recommend this album to anyone who loves melodic symphonic prog like Genesis, Novalis, Willowgrass, Rousseau, Yes (think \"To Be Over\"), Oldfield, or Camel. It may not be a masterpiece but it is an exceptional album. The gatefold mini-lp reissue features good sound and the amazing artwork of Kim Poor whose album cover won an award. Her website describes the cover as follows: \"Through bone and fire the sightless priestess foretells the future. Her eyes are denied the usual sight, but she represents events foretold: precognition, premonition and the road of the tarot are her stock in trade. The hands of this gifted seeress, and feminine intuition, allow the drawbridge of consciousness to be lifted for her, immediately becoming an open door. It is a Chinese watercolour in her background which tells of past lives ... the tower about to be struck down ... the balloons of colour that must be snatched and fully grasped in order to move forward, representing the artist herself.\" [Kim Poor] It also features two bonus tracks, a live version of \"Ace of Wands\" and a 17 minute extended version of \"Shadow.\" All in all a high-quality release and one deserving of its reputation as one of the highlights of the mid 1970s prog scene."

          "text": "Hackett delivers one of those albums where you can just hear the love and painstaking effort put into the composition and recording, but in the end the result does not quite resonate with me. This is primarily a mellow, reflective, and often times--I hate to say it--boring album. You'll find plenty of beautiful melodies and wonderful 12-string and mellotron arrangements, but often not simultaneously. I guess to be succinct, every time I put this album on, I really have to resist simply forwarding to the good parts.Highlights for me include the opener, Ace of Wands, which features plenty of up-tempo playing and lots of guitar/keyboard interplay. There are also a bunch of different synth tones and guitar sounds, which have the effect of always keeping the song fresh and engaging. Hands of the Priestess (Parts I and II) is also a definite highlight of the album, with a wonderfully gorgeous flute melodies over delicate 12-string and floating mellotron. This combination does it for me every time, and Hackett is truly one of the masters of this format.Star of Sirius, Shadow of the Heirophant. Based on other reviews and the arrangements of these songs, I know that I SHOULD thoroughly enjoy them. But I don't. I suppose one obvious reason why is that the mellow parts of the songs are a bit too repetitive, but more importantly, the faster sections are too short and lose their impact--basically I always find myself wanting more. That being said, there is plenty to delight any progger with these tracks. Star of Sirius features excellent vocal harmonies, tasteful guitar from Hackett, nice keyboard and mellotron, and a nice (except perhaps the repetitive chorus) melody. Heirophant has some incredible moments as well, such as Hackett's tapping/solo section, and the finale. The problem is that the last six minutes of the song repeat the same chords, and simply add instruments (and volume). It seems to me Hackett overdid the dynamic contrast here.I have to say that this album seems overrated--I really wonder what rating it would receive if Hackett's name was not attached to it. There's a fair amount of unique and entertaining music, but it's couched in within an equal amount of boring material. Also, this is a tough album to relax to because of the volume contrasts--I CONSTANTLY have to adjust my volume to hear the delicate parts and not subsequently have my eardrums pierced by the louder segments. Solid album, but nothing exceedingly cohesive or groundbreaking. Bonus points for the album art."

          "text": "This is a marvelous musical voyage released by Steve and his acolytes. Only Tony is missing on this one to get the whole of Genesis, while they were four.Back then, I was an orphan young boy of my most beloved band. Peter had left a few months earlier and when I heard that Steve was releasing a solo album, I rushed out to buy my copy of his work. And what an excellent surprise it was! It starts already with the great cover artwork and lasts till the last and wonderful song.The whole of this album was (and still is more than thirty years later) a real enchantment. It sounds of course fully as a Genesis album if you would except the crazy lyrics from Peter of course. It is also more instrumental (but this is more than logical).Several aspects of the band are depicted. Complex and intricate instrumental with Ace Of Wands, fully pastoral and very melodic Hands Of The Priestess (both parts). The most Crimsonesque track A Tower Struck Down is another instrumental winner. Heavy, repetitive and scary. Even if I don't listen to this piece very often, it doesn't spoil the whole. The first part really sounds as an end of the world track (till the Sieg Heil shouts are fading away). The least accessible number from Voyage Of The Acolyte.The Hermit is plunging into the Trespass-esque mood. Although I like very much the combination acoustic guitar and great keys, I can't say that the vocal part (from Steve) is on par. But this is only the start of his solo work, so I would rather be indulgent.One of the best song available is Star Of Sirius. You can't imagine a closer song from Wind & Wuthering than this one. Rhythm changes, great synthesizers and a really catchy (even poppy) chorus and tranquil verse part (in the style of One For The Vine). When you listen to this excellent piece of music featuring Phil on the lead vocals, there are no wonder that all the Genesis fans were just thrilled with this great album. Mike is just great in his bass play as well. A highlight of course.A short Horizons oriented acoustic guitar solo is opening the way for a great closing number : Shadow Of The Hierophant. If you happen to like sumptuous mellotron, this one is for you. Aerial vocals from Sally Oldfield, bombastic instrumental passages, clever guitar breaks. Another truly Genesis number and another highlight. The long, repetitive and crescendo fianle is a fantastic symphonic prog moment.This is by far the best album ever recorded by any Genesis member in a solo effort. The rating? Five stars of course! I have just ordered the remastered edition while listening again to this marvel, since I read that the two bonus tracks are really worth."

          "text": "In 1975, Steve Hackett became the first Genesis member to release a solo album. Although Anthony Phillips left Genesis in 1970, he did not release his first album until 1977, the same year Peter Gabriel released his debut solo album. Of course later on, Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks, and Phil Collins would all release solo albums. At the moment, I can't think of another band that had so many members release solo efforts, and in mostly large numbers.Hackett's debut, Voyage of the Acolyte sounded like a missing Genesis recording that never made it into the light of day. And maybe that's because Hackett had some of his Genesis friends help him out with this album, notably Mike Rutherford on bass and Phil Collins on drums. But it wasn't just that. Hackett also played the Mellotron and harmonium, adding lush background drops to these songs. Sure, it wasn't anything like having Tony Banks on board, but the effect was good enough to give it that Genesis feel.In addition to Rutherford and Collins, other musicians contributing include Steve's younger brother, John Hackett, who performs admirably on the flute and Arp synthesizer. Co-producer John Acock contributed more Mellotron, harmonium, piano, and the Elka Rhapsody, a string synthesizer. Robin Miller, who appeared on some King Crimson albums adds some oboe and English horn, and Nigel Warren-Green contributes some cello. So this is a little more than the usual Genesis affair.The music is mostly instrumental as only three of the songs contains vocals. Hackett sings on The Hermit, Collins sings on Star of Sirius, and guest vocalist, Sally Oldfield (sister of Mike Oldfield) sings on Shadow of the Hierophant. Some of the songs are quite complex (like the opener Ace of Wands), some are pastorally laid back, and the last track (Shadow of the Hierophant) is a lengthy piece deserving of placement on any of the mid-1970s Genesis releases.Hackett does a very impressive job on his debut as a songwriter. Genesis had a more democratic approach to writing music and this one really let Hackett open up. In fact, after this album Hackett often felt stifled by the Genesis approach and he often felt that he didn't have a fair share in contributing music. This led him to go solo in 1977. I don't fully understand why the other members of Genesis reacted this way towards Hackett's abilities, especially if they had listened to this album (and Collins and Rutherford played on it!!). I have no doubt that his contributions would have not only been fitting for the Genesis albums of that time, but certainly would have made them even better.Although Hackett did a great job on this album, this was all new to him. It shows on some of the material. The short pieces often sound unfinished and the cohesiveness of the album as a whole is often lacking. It seems like it jumps around a bit and it gives me a feeling of unevenness.An enjoyable listen that is highly recommended for Genesis and symphonic prog fans. Not quite a masterpiece, but surely an excellent release considering the circumstances. Four stars."

          "text": "Steve Hackett\ufffds first solo album, recorded and released while he was still in Genesis, is a mixed bag. It has some wonderful tunes and some that are less than that. At the time I thought it was a bit of a frustration. I was expecting more, specially considering the fine musicians involved. I still have the same feeling. It sounds like a Genesis record that is somewhat incomplete, without some of that magic touch all Genesis albums had so far.Most of the time my feelings were that the tunes were good, but not fully developed. Some more, some less. Even in the best songs (Ace of Hands, Star Of Sirius) I cannot help but thinking that something\ufffds missing. Don\ufffdt get me wrong, the playing is great, the production is good and the overall sound is above average. I really love that guitar sound! The problem is really the songwriting and maybe some arrangements that could bring more life to the tracks (lack of time pehaps? After all, Genesis was still the priority).All in all, a good record, even though I expected more from such talented musicians. 3 stars."

          "text": "There is lots of mellotron, sadness and beauty throughout Steve Hackett's debut record. In other words... this is my kind of album ! His GENESIS mates help out here except for Banks and Gabriel(who just left that band). Steve's brother John is on board, and he will continue to help out his brother on future releases.\"Ace Of Wands\" is surprisingly in your face to open with guitar, bass and drums leading the way. I like the synths that follow before they hit us again. Gentle guitar follows with mellotron before another outburst. Synths and bells before 2 1/2 minutes as themes continue to be repeated. It changes completely 3 1/2 minutes in. Where did that come from ? Guitar and mellotron are so good. \"Hands Of The Priestess Part !\" is a pastoral track with gently played guitar, flute and mellotron leading the way. \"A Tower Struck Down\" is a fairly heavy pulsating piece of music. Percy Jones helps out with some extra bass on this one. Synths come at 3 minutes followed by samples of a Hitler rally. The mellotron before 4 minutes is so majestic, the best on the album. \"Hands Of The Priestess Part II\" features flute, mellotron and some intricate guitar.\"The Hermit\" is the first song with vocals. Steve sings on this one as he plays acoustic guitar. Cello a minute in with flute to follow. Aboe 3 1/2 minutes in. I like this melancholic tune a lot. This song and \"The Lovers\" are the only two tracks without mellotron. \"Star Of Sirius\" is another vocal track with Phil Collins at the helm. More gentle guitar as aboe then vocals come in. Mellotron rolls in. Synths as well. Very pastoral until the song kicks into gear 2 1/2 minutes in. What a great section ! Aboe 4 minutes in with mellotron as guitar and synths follow. Very GENESIS-like here. It kicks back in around 5 minutes right to the end. \"The Lovers\" features more acoustic guitar to open until synths take over half way through. \"Shadow Of The Hierophant\" is such a gorgeous song that contrasts those uplifting sweeping mellotron sections with the higher pitched vocals of Sally Oldfield. Her voice is so moving. We get some vibes from Collins after 6 minutes which signals a change for the rest of the song. It almost becomes dead quiet, then builds with mellotron, drums, synths and more right to the end.In my opinion this is the best solo effort by a GENESIS member, although \"The Geese And The Ghost\" by Anthony Phillips is pretty darn close."

          "text": "For some people, GENESIS really disappeared the moment that Steve Hackett left the band. In a way, it is true. Onlypartially. What died with Hackett's departure wassymphonic-GENESIS, and the band still had a few good albums up their sleeves (especially the trio's first). But something good came out of all of that. Finally, the guitar-master was able to explore his art freely, to create whatever he wanted. And the results were truly magnificent. Curiously, one of Hackett's best (if notbest) albums was recordedbeforehe left GENESIS, his first masterpiece, the superb \"Voyage of the Acolyte\"We have an album made of 8 tracks, all of at least better-than-good quality. As always with Hackett, we have a big array of styles and influences, even though it's safe to say that he still owes a little bit of his sound to his(then)-main band. It's no secret also that probably this record's best tracks are, in my view, those two which feature GENESIS members alongside Hackett. So, hearing the style (still much more prog-rock-oriented and less world-music) and having in mind the collaboration of Collins and Rutherford, both factors would clearly affirm that the guitarist's own project was still not 100% his own. That, of course, is a totally invalid conclusion, and I'd say it's the other way around.For what we have here is 100% Steve Hackett, exactly because abig part of GENESIS' beautiful music was due to Hackett's wonderful playing. If one ever wonders what was lost in the band's music after \"Wind and Wuthering\" (I would say after \"And then there were three\", an album were the trio still managed to pull a prog masterpiece), it was theatmosphericstyle, that sound that evoked somethingbeyondthe music. What GENESIS lacked from \"Duke\" onwards was, simply put,magic, the kind of magic that their guitarist was able to provide in enormous, immeasurable quantities (and, mostly, quality).Steve Hackett has never been a guitarist that tries to show off his skills. We will rarely hear him dazzling us with his speed or his mind-defying fingering. His technique is superb, even admired by classical music fans, but it's not in his fingersbut in his mind, in his imaginationwhere we will find the true high art. He manages to make the guitar sound like a keyboard, manages to make it cry, to make it laugh, toexpress things that can't be explained in words.De-wording music is actually makingpuremusic, and Hackett achieves this constantly. He invented (or perfected, actually) techniques later falsely attributed to others, he played music thought impossible for rock musicians, but that's not what his art is about. His art is aboutsounds, aboutcreating a canvas where his guitar's notes are the brushes and the colors at the same time.His art is aboutsongwriting, for if there's any doubt that Hackett can craft a good track, it only takes a few listens to any of his albums to erase it.Ace of Wands (8.5/10) The most energetic of the lot, is also probably the less atmospheric but at the same time the more virtuosic. But even in the midst of the convulsion the artist creates magic in a middle section that ascends to the stars. Excellent opener.Hands of the Priestess - Part I (9.5/10) A beautiful opening reveals a flute that tries to bewitch us like that one that legend found in Hamelin. We will dearly follow its trail. Pure beauty. This is what prog music is all about. Short but memorable.A tower Struck Down (8/10) A very haunting, menacing opening sends shivers down our spines. Terror lurks in the dark it would seem. Peace eludes us as the second section fills us with even more doubts and uncertainty. The scene has flames, little figures dancing around it, mental-illness, eyes like tornadoes. Very good track.Hand of the Priestess - Part II (9/10) The amazing melody of Part I returns but this time it sounds more pastoral, with an oboe singing the tune in a joyous celebration of nature and prog-rock. Even shorter, but still outstanding.The Hermit (9/10) The beginning is very sad, with vocals appearing for the first time, buried under three feet of reverb, coming from a distant place. It's Hackett, who never was a singer but always was (and is) an artist who knows where and how to use his voice. The flute appears again, with a little melancholic melody. The end of the track is pure instrumental bliss. Excellent.Star of Sirius (9.5/10) My love for GENESIS shines through when, at the mere appearance of Phil Collins' voice, I smile. Of course, the majestic music underneath it is what really captures my emotions. Everything is pensive, atmospheric, surreal; a figure in keys appears which announces the arrival of the fast section, full of the same glorious relaxed-energy that only GENESIS or its guitarist could create. We get a repetition of both sections, and we long for more minutes when the track's 7 are finally over. Superb.The Lovers (8/10) A quick interlude in acoustic guitar, this is very soft and acts as the perfect introduction for the magic that is about to unfold.Shadow of the Hierophant (10/10) Mike Rutherford collaborates with Hackett in this track, and one can't deny the importance of his input. But in the end, it's the music that absolutely overwhelms us. When the female voice rises over the acoustic arpeggio, it's like an angel singing to us tales that we can't yet grasp because we've never been told to truly understand beauty. The tragic melody that strikes when the bass and drums come back feels like a dagger in our weakened hearts. The celestial creature sings again, but then we're brought back to our senses immediately before we can get lost in so much light. She appears once again, but for the third time she's stricken off the canvas. Suddenly Hackett starts playing around with his instrument, he taps the strings creating a whirlwind that ascends to a much brighter place. The music is happier now. Percussive vibes start announcing the arrival of the final part of the epic. First we get it at very low intensity. It grows until it explodes tenderly in our ears. And a superb song has ended, one of the best in all rock. The album fades.There are no weak tracks and no boring moments. Maybe a couple songs could've been evenbetter, but rarely do we get albums like that. This is a towering masterpiece that grows with me every time I hear it, like the legend that created it, arguably the greatest guitarist in all progressive-rock, and for my taste, in all that is rock."

          "text": "The solo voyage beginsSteve Hackett is one of my all time favourite guitarists and possibly my favourite solo recording artist. Yet, I cannot rate most of his solo studio albums higher than three stars. His solo debut, Voyage Of An Acolyte suffers from the same problems as many other Steve Hackett solo albums.The first half or so of the album is entirely instrumental. The Jazz-Rock/Fusion of Ace Of Wands and the mellow, acoustic folk of Hands Of The Priestess (parts 1 & 2) as well as the dark, heavy A Tower Struck Down are all excellent, but still not quite masterpiece standard. These four opening tracks give the impression that the whole album is an instrumental affair (as it probablyshouldhave been!). But this is not so, however. The Hermit is the first vocal track; a soft, mellow song, sung by Steve himself, that leaves no lasting impression on me. I think that Steve's singing voice would develop and mature very much over the years and become much better in the 80's and 90's.Star Of Sirius features vocals by Phil Collins and is a decent song. However, it sounds more like a Genesisleftoverthan a 'lost Genesis classic' to my ears. On albums like Trick Of The Tale or Wind And Wuthering it would easily have been theleastgood track by far. And thank goodness that Steve stayed in Genesis for another couple of albums before he went solo for real. Voyage Of An Acolyte proves that he wasn't ready for a real solo career just yet.The closing number Shadow Of A Hierophant has vocals by Sally Oldfield. She has a beautiful voice, but it is completely out of place on this album. Besides, having different vocalists on different tracks on the same album almost never works. And that is something that brings a lot of Hackett solo albums down. The closing section of this last track is way too long and seems to be going absolutely nowhere.Overall, apart from Ace Of Wands and a Tower Struck Down, Voyage Of An Acolyte is a very soft and mellow album. It really would have benefited from a couple of rock songs like Every Day from the Spectral Mornings album or Camino Royal from Highly Strung or Mechanical Bride from To Watch The Storms.Sorry Steve, but this album is simply not the masterpiece some people say it is! There certainly are a few real gems on this album, but as a whole this is hardly excellent. If you are new to Steve Hackett's solo discography, I would recommend starting with a later album (but please don't touch his next one, Please Don't Touch!), or even better, one of his excellent, recent live DVDs where he blends highlights from his entire solo career (including a couple of pieces from the present album, often in improved form!) with some Genesis material.Good, but Steve would do much better later on"

          "text": "Voyage Of The Acolyte is the debut solo album from Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. It\ufffds no secret that Steve Hackett is one of my big heroes and sources of inspiration when it comes to guitar playing. His innovative approach to the use of a guitar is praised by many and his contributions to Genesis sound is invaluable.Voyage of the Acolyte was recorded while Steve Hackett was still a member of Genesis in the turbulent time after Peter Gabriel had left the band and Genesis was in search for a new singer. This meant that the members had time to concentrate on other projects for a while and Steve Hackett decided it was time for a solo album. He is helped by his brother John Hackett on flute, Arp synthetizer and bells and his Genesis collegues Mike Rutherford on bass guitar, bass pedals and Fuzz 12-String and Phil Collins on drums, vibes, percussion and vocals. There are also contributions from John Acock, Sally Oldfield, Robin Miller, Nigel Warren-Green, Percy Jones, Johnny Gustafson, Steve Tobin. Steve Hackett plays electric & acoustic guitar, Mellotron, harmonium, bells, autoharp, effects and sings lead on the song The Hermit.Voyage Of The Acolyte turned out to be a big succes both among fans and critics and as a consequence Steve Hackett\ufffds desire for a solo career and full control over his music grew to a point where he couldn\ufffdt see himself as part of a band anymore. He stayed with Genesis for two more albums ( A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering) but then decided to leave.The music on Voyage Of The Acolyte is very dynamic progressive rock. There are loud symphonic parts with lots of mellotron and Steve Hackett\ufffds signature electric guitar leads and soft parts with flute and acoustic guitar. Besides that there are also a few fusion elements on the album.Ace Of Wands starts the album in melodic fusion mode. It\ufffds a rather challenging song but very memorable and melodic. Hands of the Priestess Part I is a beautiful soft song with flute from John Hackett. A Tower Struck Down which is my favorite here is probably the most experimental song. It\ufffds in fusion territory with some extraordinaire bassplaying. Hands of the Priestess Part II is just a short interlude before the calm The Hermit where we hear vocals for the first time on the album. Steve Hackett sings lead on that song. Star of Sirius has Phil Collins on lead vocals. The Lovers is just a short beautiful song before the Epic Shadow of the Hierophant where Sally Oldfield sings lead. It\ufffds a 11:44 minute long symphonic song with both calm parts and bombastic symphonic ditto.The musicianship is great and the production is good.Many reviewers have written praising reviews of this one but I must admit that even though I do enjoy Voyage Of The Acolyte I don\ufffdt think it\ufffds a very cohesive album and the full picture suffers because of this IMO. This is good music but I fail to see it being excellent and therefore I will only rate this 3 big stars. Genesis fans will have an interest here, but like me ( and I\ufffdm a giant Genesis fan) it\ufffds not certain that they will be more than partially satisfied with Voyage Of The Acolyte."

          "text": "Like much of his work, the first Steve Hackett solo release had to grow on me. I was not immediately delighted with what I heard, but after some time, the album gained life and a more frequent place in my player. Having heard it multiple times, I can do nothing less than rate it higher than I initially expected I would. Fans of early Camel should appreciate this much, as the varying textures of sound are pleasing to the ear. Give this album time- it sits loftily among Hackett's best.\"Ace of Wands\" \"Ace of Wands\" kicks off with a frantic guitar introduction that reminds me of what The Mars Volta would be doing three decades later. Insanely creative guitar work dominates this piece, but aside from the dual lead work, there are patches of tasteful synthesizer, acoustic guitar, bells, and more, all laid over a cool bass line. The sudden whistle is a really silly transition, but other than that this is a solid instrumental, full of energy. It is a great way to begin the album.\"Hands of the Priestess, Part 1\" This sorrowful instrumental centers around acoustic guitar and flute, with a mournful electric guitar creeping in now and then. The Mellotron adds an extra layer.\"A Tower Struck Down\" The rhythmic structure is similar in feel to the \"Apocalypse in 9/8\" section of \"Supper's Ready\" by Genesis. This piece could have fit right in with the darker moments of The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway; bits of it sounds like it came right out of \"The Colony of Slippermen.\" The last minute of the song begins with a breathtaking Mellotron that segues into the final moments, which are rather bland, but not awful..\"Hands of the Priestess, Part 2\" Another beautiful track, this one is under two minutes, and features acoustic guitar, flute, and oboe, among other instruments that add to the layer of pleasing sound.\"The Hermit\" Like a lonely a hermit, Steve Hackett's despairing voice is only accompanied by his twelve-string guitar. He sounds as though he's performing his lonesome song in the deep recesses of a cave, and you, a mere passerby, are hearing it from within. Sharing in his woe, and curious, you seek him out and join him on cello. Another person comes in with a flute. And so forth. The piece is simple and initially forgettable, but once you've heard it a second time, the song reaches into the alcoves of your mind and it all comes back to you. The long ending is lovely, as though the hermit has finally found friends.\"Star of Sirius\" This is the crowning moment of the album, one with beautiful twelve-string guitar and synthesizer. Phil Collins does a fine job singing on this one, and the vocal harmonies are not to be missed. The warbling synthesizer over the twelve-string guitar has become a staple sound by now. The middle section sounds like it came right out of a glorious classical piece. The chorus is exciting and amusing. The vocal melody is one of the most original and pleasing melodies I have ever heard.\"The Lovers\" Quiet classical guitar, reversed electric guitar, winds, and other soft instruments make up this one-and-a-half-minute instrumental piece.\"Shadow of Hierophant\" The previous piece only serves as a short introduction before a massive wall of Mellotron, electric guitar, and drums come crashing through. The female voice almost makes one forget he is listening to progressive rock, but opera instead. Once again, the Mellotron weighs heavily in this piece, as does Hackett's acoustic guitar work. Halfway, he institutes a great amount of tapping on an electric guitar laden with effects. Also once again, one may hear this as a piece that Peter Gabriel-led Genesis could have concocted, so it really shows Steve Hackett's contributions in his former band, It showcases him more, though, which is perhaps why similar songs were not included in Genesis records. It's a brilliant work, all said."

          "text": "Quite the voyageSteve Hackett's debut is very much likely to soothe anyone who has ever been a fan ofGenesis. LikeChris Squire's sole solo album,Fish Out Of Waterwas called ''The lostYesalbum'', this one quickly falls under the same comparison for the other progressive giants for the 70s. As many people know, Hackett was a somewhat outspoken force in the band and it only became apparent just how much Hackett brought to the table for the band when he leftAnd Then There Were Three, some might say. Hackett'sGenesisbuddies just about all show up with the exception of Peter Banks and Peter Gabriel, and while the album definitely does not sound like aGenesisalbum in its purest form, it certainly has some moments where it comes close. The nice and most surprising thing about the album is just how much energy this album has. Many people may have a problem withGenesisand their lack of 'rocking' moments, but on this album no such thing can be said, even if the serene moments do exist on the album.The best parts of the album are the ones where Steve really wants to show some flash as a guitar player. The album opens with what's likely the best of these purely ambitious prog rock tracks in the form ofAce Of Wands, which is surprisingly fast, energetic and with enough pure rock power to put a lot of other bands to shame. Like many songs on the album, this one is an instrumental and like most other songs on the album it has a wonderful melody that is bound to get stuck in your head. These melodies are reprised later on in the album, revealing its true nature as a concept album.A Tower Struck Downis not as hard rocking or as fast as the opening tune, but it certainly makes for a great story telling device with the sampled sounds and chantings which make it truly malevolent. This song is bookended by the two-part, brief but calm instrumentalHands Of The Priestesswhose mood makes for a surprising contrast to the other songs on the album.Of course, Steve's compositional prowess also shows through on the album.Star Of Siriusis likely the best example of this, and arguably the best song on the album. Phil Collins makes an appearance on this track on the microphone, but he does so in his dreamyTrick Of The Tailvoice, which when mixed with Steve's soundscapes makes for a crazy-good track ripe with melody, symphonic bombast and familiarity thanks to the reprisal ofAce Of Wands. Other songs which follow this kind of structure are also on the album, but both of them are a lot more toned down.The Hermitends off side one impressively, and on side twoThe Loversis voiced gently by Sally Oldfield and makes for a very tranquil track. The album ends with the storm-gatheringShadow Of The Hierophant, a somewhat repetitive song which is simply a build to its peak and then a decline into silence signaling the end of the album. Used more for mood than anything else.In the end Steve Hackett has created an emotional and technically impressive ride which will thrill fans of his other projects and interest just about everyone else. This album is considered a symphonic classic for a reason, and while not essential is certainly deserving of a strong 4 stars of sirius out of 5. Very much recommended."

          "text": "Several years back I checked out most of the songs on this album and I remember mainly one thing out of that experience: I couldn't understand why almost everybody is so enthusiastic about this debut by Hackett. Ok, the whole thing isn't really bad or poor but it's really somewhat pale compared to the first 8 albums by Genesis. And that's what's bugging me really. You would expect if someone like Hackett leaves the band due to difference of (artistic) opinion , he would at leasr come up with something truly great. But that's not quite the case I feel.The opener Ace of Wands is one of the better songs and gives at least some hope. I would give this one 3,75 stars probably. Next Hands of the Priestess pt.1 stars with beautiful flute but I'm underwhelmed with Hacketts guitar performance (3,5). A Tower Struck Down sounds like a flat copy of Crimsons Red to me. Nothing impressive about this track, maybe the funny keysounds are nice but that's all (2,75). Second (short) part of the Hands of the Priestess is too short actually to have substantial impact and significance. Just ok (3*). The Hermit is a nice ballad but again it fails to impress me in any way. Hacketts vocal performance tells enough in this respect. Oboe and flute towards the end save the song somewhat (3,25*). Star of Sirius starts in the same vein but mainly (again) the vocal contribution destroys the fun for me. I do like the keys and they prevent me from really hating this song. All in all just not good enough for a high rating despite some nice melodic moments (3,5*). The Lovers is the second very short track starting with acoustic guitar later accompanied by mellotron. Ok but again: no more (3*). The closer Shadow of the Hierophant is the supposed highlight but is actually the biggest disappointment to me. The female vocals are not my cup of tea, maybe enchanting in a way like a sort of siren but somehow it puts me off a bit. What bothers me most is te eslow style of the song, it just drags on, there is no energy or captivating element as far as I'm concerned. If I compare this song to Cinema Show or Firth of Fifth for example this is simply a weak effort I have to say. Last 5 minutes make things even worse for me and I can only give some 2,5* at best I'm afraid.So that leaves an average of just above 3 stars and therefore I can only give this rating for Steve Hacketts debut. There are hardly any moments where he proves he's a great guitarist or songwriter. I'm in severe doubt if I will check out more of his material since this is the only album I own by him. Not recommended."

          "text": "This is a classic prog album, well beloved of fans of Hackett and those who came to his solo work through Genesis. Yes, it launched a great solo career. Yes, it is a welcome breath of fresh air. But no, it isn't Steve's seminal album. Neither is it the mythical \"Lost Genesis Album.\" It's a good debut that promises much better in the future. Three stars (alhough it is only with a great effort of restraint that I can resist awarding 4..)Anyhow, track by track.Ace of Wands is a frenetic but unimaginative introduction into Steve's worlds of guitar composition and virtuosity. It's ok, but if this were all he had to offer, this would be a forgettable album, just as this is a forgettable track.Hands of the Priestess pt. 1 shows us what is in store for us lucky fans. Steve's brother John is an accomplished flautist, and tracks like this one and it's reprise prepare us for some of the truly great things that they will accomplish later.A Tower Struck Down is track that I find most interesting. This one lands firmly in progdom, but not in Genesis style progdom. Steve reaches out on his own and finds a most interesting mix of unusual time signature, weird sounds and effects, and nice composition. This foreshadows that we will hear later on Spectral Mornings in Clocks and Tigermoth.Hands of the Priestess pt. 2 has the virtues of the first part.The Hermit is an interesting and well-composed song. No more, no less. Nothing stellar here, and certainly nothing that raises the quality of the album.Star of Sirius is a song that is so hard to evaluate. One of the difficulties is Phil's vocals. Phil is still in his earliest vocal mode. This is before his aping of PG and belongs to the period when he was thought of as the angelic voice backing Mr. Gabriel. But here he is featured. I find that this style fits the song, but I also find it mildly annoying. Another difficulty is that this song is basically simplistic, except for the tempo changes. Brother John (an unintentional Lamb reference, I promise you) shows up in an interesting way on instruments other than the flute. Sharp tempo changes add a lot of interest, as does Hackett's bright and interesting performances. I like this track, but I sure can see where some people would be far less enthusiastic about it.The Lovers is mellow guitar for the first part and then mellow synth and guitar for the rest of it. It's a short and pleasing track, but hardly exceptional.Shadow of the Hierophant is obviously intended as the piece de resistance. It falls short. If there is one track on this album that reminds me of Genesis, this is it,, but it sure doesn't remind me of Genesis at their best. Still this does fit into the post-Gabriel style,. Sally Oldfield is an interesting choice of vocalist, and brother John is enthusiastically present once again. It's mediocre.Anyhow, what we are left with here is an album where about half of the time listening is mediocre and the other half foreshadows things much better. I suppose that if one considered what this album meant to prog in a historical sense, one could bump this up to four stars. But I'm giving it three."

          "text": "The Missing Piece of GenesisSteve Hackett's Voyage of the Acolyte has often been called the missing Genesis album, and there are clear reasons why. Hackett's guitar had figured prominently in many of the band's best loved songs by some fans (including me). \"Return of Giant Hogweed,\" \"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight,\" and \"Firth of Fifth\" rely heavily on Hackett's carefully composed but also explosive lead guitar skills, and remain among the best tracks of the classic era. 1974's Lamb Lays Down on Broadway focused much more heavily on the storyline and vocals, and of all the musicians left in the shadows of that theatrical monster, Hackett probably suffered the most.During the time that Genesis was searching for singers, Hackett wrote and eventually released Voyage of the Acolyte. The album has some amazing music, sounds that both the Lamb and W&W onward could have used in greater quantity. At the same time, the compositions are not nearly as complex or mature as Genesis of that era. One wonders what heights could have been if the 4 could have successfully integrated Hackett. But it was not to be.Voyage of the Acolyte is the closest approximation, as this album features Phil Collins on drums throughout, and vocals on one track. In addition, Mike Rutherford adds bass on a few tracks, including some fuzz bass, something outside his usual tone. Critically though, Steve's brother John takes the keys, which while adding the perfect tonality and atmosphere, provides none of the virtuosic creativity Tony Banks gave to Genesis. John Hackett did, however, add some magnificent flute parts that matched anything on a Genesis album.Voyage's opening track, \"Ace of Wands,\" is a great example of what is good and bad about the album. Each composed section is superb, but the way in which they are arranged is simply poor. Sections return without development or variation and one transition uses an embarrassing explosion that sounds like a 1975 TV movie. Still, the sections are so good on their own merit, that I find myself returning to the album often.All of the flavors one loves in classic prog are here: complex multi-layered parts, flute interludes, mellotron, pastoral sections punctuated with aggressive rock. As such, this album superficially sounds amazing. Aside from a few bumps (the pop of the chorus of \"Star of Sirius\") the music is beautiful prog. The multipart \"Hands of the Priestess / Tower Struck Down\" is indeed prog at its best. Unfortunately, the epic \"Shadow of the Heirophant\" though beautiful, is actually one of the weaker songs on the album. Already overlong, the extended version provided as a bonus is simply pointless. (Of historic interest is the fact that \"Heirophant\" contains a tapping cadenza eerily like Eddie Van Halen's \"Eruption\" but predating it by 3 years on record. Steve Hackett's role in the expansion of the guitar technique is criminally underappreciated.)Though it has its weaknesses, this is a great album that belongs in most prog libraries. It's not Genesis, but close enough to satisfy any fan's need for more from that phenomenal group. Pick it up and enjoy!"

          "text": "Hackett's first solo album is an astounding piece of music and shows ample proof of the major role he must have played within Genesis. Ace of Wands is an excellent upbeat instrumental composition with great riffs and more things going on then on other artist's full albums. Play the opening 30 seconds a bit heavier and you're inside an Opeth album. But after 2 minutes of balancing soft acoustic parts against heavy guitars, it goes in all sorts of direction. Folky, classic, moogy, funky, Genesisy. Everything passes on the catwalk and believe me, it works just fine.Next on is Hands of the Priestess. I don't know what priestess Hackett was thinking of, but given the soft porn leanings of this tune, it's not difficult imagining some of those priestesses and their hands. Yes a dirty mind is a joy forever :-)A Tower Stuck Down is entirely different matter. Dark, heavy, threatening, brooding, extravagant, stubborn. No way this could have ended up on any Genesis album. The last half minute of it has some slow picking that reminds me strangely enough of both the ending chords of Rush's Cygnus X1 and the intro for A Forest by The Cure. Or how very different styles of music sometimes come up with almost the exact same thing.The Hermit is another gentle piece. I like Hackett's voice here. Reminds me of that same subdued passion of Andy Latimer. After a reprise of the Priestesses, Phil Collins comes in to spoil the album with a bland performance on Star of Sirius. In the times of vinyl, I used to turn the record and place the needle right after this track to conclude the album with the stunning Hierophant.Majestic opening bars (that he must have stolen from Opeth again) lead into a nice folksy ditty sung by a woman who reminded me of the siren on Mike Oldfield albums. Hey look, she's named Sally Oldfield. We get 4 and a half minutes of superb sweeping guitars and mellotons, balanced against the acoustic parts. It flows into a moody guitar solo and ends with a 6 minute crescendo that blasts away Ravel's Bolero off the face of the planet. This is the one of the most stunning 6 minutes in rock music for me. It's subtle and colourful yet at the same time immensily dark and heavy. Majestic.Even disregarding Phil's annoying disruption, this is a true prog masterpiece. 4.5 stars"

          "text": "The debut album of Steve Hackett sees him fully attached to the early Genesis tradition of progressive rock - albeit with less song-writing and more instrumental parts. Sally Oldfield sings on two classical music influenced songs and Phil Collins sings on the more typical symphonic prog suite 'Star Of Sirius'. To me none of these compositions sound quite finished or particularly well performed; often resulting in summations of ideas - rather than well though out structures. An example; the last track 'Shadow Of The Hierophant' has a great ending theme that ends up wasted by a lack of context or function. The sound of the record is fine and I guess most fans of Genesis and symphonic prog will still enjoy this record, but I didn't feel at all bothered not owning it anymore."

          "text": "Some musicians see things as they are and ask 'Why?' Steve Hackett sees things as they could be, and asks 'Why not?'He's always had this approach. For Hackett, it's rarely about what he should be doing but what hecouldbe doing. Not what was expected of him, but what he might get away with considering the liberal musical era and the opportunities afforded him through the success of Genesis. After all, 1975 was an enlightening year for him and many others in the professional rock community (both Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page among others were in the midst of serious drug withdrawl, Clapton chronicling this period on his461 Ocean Boulevard) and somehow through the haze of smack-tinctured eyes and coke-eaten septums, astonishing music was being made. By almost everyone.For Genesis, a British institution, major changes were occurring. Peter Gabriel left to pursue his own directions and the band tightened-up musically, going on to release at least four more excellent LPs (two with Hackett who himself would leave in '77 after the greatWind & Wuthering). It makes the timing of this, Steve Hackett's first self-led effort, both right and unexpected in that it was made before this master axeman left the band. Some will point to similarities with Genesis' music here, of which there certainly are several, and perhaps at the time that worked against the record. But in today's context it works just fine if you've a taste for progressive rock at the very height of its whole maddening marvelousness. Plus we get to hear what makes a really good solo project so compelling, so full of new liberties and ideas previously undiscovered, unneeded or discouraged. The value of the singular vision in contrast to the equally valuable group effort, and why one member of a band is so significant to how that unit sounds and operates. And it's among Hackett's very best work.Of course he got some very good help. Phil Collins' shamelessly confident skins bop open 'Aces of Wands', totally prog, packed with sheet-pressed layers of Hackett's rounded lines, mellotrons, what sounds like an Arp synth on sci-fi lead, and trooper Mike Rutherford taking no prisoners on bass. The 12-string acoustic is out for romantic part 1 of 'Hands of the Priestess', bucolic and gentle, a good balance to the opener, and Wettonesque pounder 'A Tower Struck Down' with its extra bass parts and unsettling rhythmic lurches continues the constant redirection. A nice attempt at neoclassical in 'The Hermit' reminding of the Selling England days, tarnished slightly by our host's medium singing but kept aloft by his subtle arrangement, extending into sister piece 'Star of Sirius' with a welcome Collins on voice for a lively number peppered by Hackett's laserbeam fills. Another well-placed acoustic interlude before twelve minute closer 'Shadow of the Hierophant' spotlighting Sally Oldfield's heady soprano, ominous battlements from the band, and Steve Hackett's massive mountains.Not comparable to his following releases, this will be a grower for some and an instant love for others. A remaster would be even better. Nice one, Steve."

(I find it interesting that neither of these two gems contains any help from keyboardist Tony Banks.) While there is a cohesive flow and consistency to this album--feel and mood---there is something a little muddy in the recording/engineering that always left me feeling a bit frustrated--I wanted to hear the distinctive contributions of all the instruments but they always felt a bit too quiet or muddled. Also some of the sections--as beautiful as they are--are either repeated too formulaically or go on a bit too long. I liked the album a lot back in the day--played it quite a bit--and still play \"Star of Sirius\" and \"Shadow of the Heirophant\" from time to time. It's just recorded too quietly (for some instruments). IMO, Steve's best solo work of the 70s-80s is on his third album, Spectral Mornings."

          "text": "On the local FM station back in 1975, perhaps 1976, they announced that they would be playing the solo album by the guitarist for GENESIS. My reaction as a naive 16 year old was, \"What, Genesis has a guitarist?\" The instrumental aspects of the group's sound were so dominated by Tony Banks that even some of Hackett's delicate work could have been accidentally construed as keyed rather than fretted. But, no matter, yes indeed Genesis had a guitarist, a fine one at that, but a composer and songwriter he was not, especially in 1975.As if to accentuate his strengths and shortcomings simultaneously, \"Ace of Wands\" busts out of the gate like a bull in heat. It is shortly tamed, but the major impression of incompleteness is thus established early and reinforced throughout. It's ALL enjoyable enough, whether delicate (\"Hands of the Priestess\") or harder edged (\"Tower Struck Down\") but none of it outstanding. The best of the lot is \"Star of Sirius\", which suggests future tracks like \"Entangled\", but lacking that piece's cohesion. \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" is an even better/worse example - the mellotron theme is simplistically lovely and hypnotic, but how many times do we need to hear it? Worse, even SALLY OLDFIELD cannot impart much distinction to the vocal parts in between. While I enjoy it well enough,, it is neither valid as a song nor as an epic, a sonic Amazon hand in hand with a compositional dwarf. Already twice as long as it has any right to be, the bonus material includes an extended playout version! Nuff said.\"Voyage of the Acolyte\" was released at a time when the members of GENESIS were still nurturing each others' powers while holding weaknesses in check. Hackett was still writing and producing better material within the tightening shackles of the band. Nostalgia aside, modern bands like HOSTSONATEN and ERIS PLUVIA improved upon the pastoral images herein, while Hackett himself refined his writing, composing and even vocal skills over his lengthy voyage. Nonetheless, this is a good effort from a man deserving of his many acolytes and accolades."

It is my understanding the music inVoyage of the Acolytewas written as material for Genesis. That being said, it is hard to find a way this music would have fit in the Genesis library. At times, especially when you hear the vocals of Phil Collins, or the very familiar rock guitar work of Hackett himself, the pieces seem to fit together. But the overriding fantasy theme was a split from the direction that Genesis itself was going. Additionally,Voyage of the Acolytestands out from Hackett's subsequent work; where his next few albums tend to be more piecemeal work,Voyage of the Acolyteholds together cohesively as a single concept. As a matter of fact, it sticks out as one of the most important concept albums in Symphonic Progressive Rock history.From start to finish, the word that most immediately springs to mind when thinking about this album is 'beautiful'. It is difficult to maintain the level of contrast exemplified in this album without sacrificing any sense of flow. Oftentimes attempts are made to adapt medieval themes to rock music, with results that turn out 'campy' to say the least. This album avoids the pitfalls of its less attractive stepsisters. Hackett not only brought the material to make this happen, but also assembled just the right carpenters to shape the material into the construct that he wanted.Final Score:Voyage of the Acolyteis a top 10 album in my collection and an essential piece to any Symphonic Progressive Rock collection. Everything about this problem is attractive. The writing, the playing, the recording quality, even the cover and sleeve art are attractive. There's no question that this masterpiece album deserves five out of five stars."

          "text": "It makes sense that VOYAGE OF THE ACOLYTE is dubbed ''the album that Genesis never recorded''. Obvious to most prog fans is that it is Steve Hackett's album (many point to him as a key figure in the 70's Genesis sound, as do I), but also that Rutherford and (Phil) Collins help out. I can draw a few comparisons to this album and THE GEESE AND THE GHOST, Ant Phillips's first solo record, in that both had held the guitar position in Genesis and Mike and Phil contribute on both records. Their solo albums will appeal to fans of different eras of Genesis; if Phillips's spoke more to the TRESPASS junkies, the ones who like albums like FOXTROT might find this more rewarding.I can hear some of the Genesis sound in this, but VOYAGE OF THE ACOLYTE has its own sound in a way (I guess THE GEESE AND THE GHOST does as well, something I failed to mention in that review). Steve Hackett's guitar sound is the defining characteristic here; it always had something unique about, most notably heard on the wacky opener ''Ace of Wands''. Much of the album is guitar-centric; many of the tracks are either entirely based around acoustic melodies or they have sections pulsated by gentle, acoustic passages (think ''Star of Sirius'').The singing is at best okay; Hackett himself has the best vocal performance on the album on ''The Hermit'' (why does Camel come to my mind when I hear that song?), not that Phil or Sally Oldfield are horrible, but their performances come off as dry to me. The opening third of ''Shadow of the Heirophant'' levels the actual beauty of the piece as a whole; the mellotron- drenched ending really defines symphonic music without an actual symphony much like King Crimson's ''Epitaph''.I got this album and Ant Phillips's debut at the same time, so I find myself comparing the two rather often. I rate VOYAGE OF THE ACOLYTE higher because this has more appeal to the symphonic prog fans as well as having more rocking sections. Other than the beginning third of ''Heirophant'' and ''The Lovers'' to an extent, VOYAGE OF THE ACOLYTE is quite solid. Definitely will appeal to the fans of classic Genesis."

          "text": "Since this is Steve Hackett - the then-guitarist of Genesis - we're talking about, it's easy to have high expectations of his debut solo album. Sadly however, whilst this album is certainly unique and interesting, it's perhaps not the classic that you'd expect.On the Genesis albums, Hackett had never been much of a standout guitarist, in the way that Steve Howe or Robert Fripp had been, but had instead been content to work mainly in the background, letting Tony Banks take the lead on most of the solos. Sure he let out the occasional guitar solo, e.g.Firth of Fifth, but never anything too monumental. His solo album would then surely be a chance to hear his talents in the spotlight? Not so. Here we see a man who takes his music deadly seriously, and writes music for orchestral instruments, with the occasional prog rock twist.I've always enjoyed solo albums for the line-ups on the album. 'Voyage of the Acolyte' is no exception, as Hackett manages to bring Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford from Genesis to play on drums and bass guitar respectively. Whilst Collins has now become the anti-christ of prog, back then he was known for his impressive drumming ability, and it shows here. Rutherford had been even more of a background man in Genesis, and even though he still is in the background here, there's no denying that he can be heard more on this album. Also appearing is John Hackett, Steve's younger brother, on flute and synthesizer. John would go on to appear on most of Steve Hackett's solo albums. A number of other guest stars appear, but I shall get to them later.The album begins cleverly with the full-on prog instrumentalAce Of Wands. It's clever in the sense that any proghead who'd picked the record up and started the first side would instantly be drawn in by the sensational intro drum fill. In the first four seconds of this album, you are immediately transported into a world of proggy wonder. Since purchasing this album, there's always been a little button I can press on my iTunes menu to hear that wonderful fill. The rest of the song isn't that bad either. There are soaring electric guitars, synthesizers and flutes, all blended into a beautiful melodic whole. In my opinion, this is the best track on the album.Next up is an acoustic track,Hands of the Priestess, Pt. 1. This is where the album starts to get dull. Very little happens in this track, and it feels like filler. However,A Tower Struck Downchanges all this. The electric sounds are brought back for a dark instrumental. Strangely enough, this is the most Genesis-y the album gets (e.g. the riff that begins at 1:17). Unfortunately, it starts to get a little repetitive after a while. Suddenly, in the middle of the track, there is a recording of a person coughing, and then a recording of people shouting 'Sieg, Heil!' before an explosion. The rest of the track is quiet, and we are left wondering what on earth that was all about.Hands of the Priestess, Pt. 2picks up from where part one ended. This part is slightly more interesting, as it reprises a riff from the end ofAce Of Wands.The Hermitis a very dull song indeed. The main feature of this track is Steve Hackett singing, which is hardly that impressive. He actually reminds me slightly of Camel's Andrew Latimer. The track is dominated by acoustic guitar, but features oboe and flute too. A very pretty song, but also dreadfully dull.Over to Side 2, we start withStar of Sirius, a song which features Phil Collins on vocals. His voice has been double tracked, giving a very strange effect. Those familiar with later Genesis may find the familiarity of his voice helps them to get into this song. It is a song with verses and choruses, but it is definitely progressive, as there is an instrumental that is very reminiscent ofThe Hermiton Side 1. The chorus is actually quite catchy and I do enjoy this song every time I put it on. Doing research for this album lead me to an amazing discovery: John Gustafson of Roxy Music and Quatermass plays the bass on this track, in place of Mike Rutherford.The Loversis another short and dull instrumental, in lieu ofHorizonsfrom 'Foxtrot'. Perhaps the only intersting point is that it uses a short snippet from the next track.The final track on the album is in fact Hackett's longest solo track to date.Shadow of the Heirophantstands at an impressive 11:43, but when listening to it, one realises that there's hardly 5 minutes worth of music, as this is actually a very repetitive song. Essentially, there are two parts to this track, the six-minute 'main part' and the mammoth six-minute 'outro'. In the main part of the song, We hear guest star Sally Oldfield (sister of Mike Oldfield) use her stunningly beautiful voice. Her voice reaches the highest notes with seemingly little effort. The instrumentation is a blend of mellotron and electric guitar for the non vocal parts, and acoustic for the main part, which overall gives a very powerful and \"important\" feel to the song. The outro, as already mentioned, is six minutes long, and consists of the same riff repeated over and over, in lieu of The Beatles'I Want You (She's So Heavy). It gets louder and louder until eventually fading away towards the end. While this is certainly a grandiose exit, one can't help but notice that the riff doesn't feel quite right. In other words, whilst being a very good riff, it's not quite as satisfying as, say, theW\ufffdrmsegment ofStarship Trooper. On the remastered CD, there is a 17 minute extended studio version of this song, which essentially extends the outro to 11 minutes, as well as increase the volume of Collins' drumming. If you're quite the fan of the outro, then this will be a huge bonus, but otherwise, there is hardly any reason to listen to this version.Kim Poor was the artist responsible for the beautiful yet disturbing paintings on the cover and in the gatefold. The CD remaster is extremely good, as it not only includes both paintings, but actually extends the gatefold painting to it's full size, essentially giving us more than the vinyl sleeve. Hackett and Poor would marry, and she would do all his artwork, following a trend that Robert Wyatt and Alfreda Benge had set. Also included on the CD is a live version ofAce Of Wandswhich is vastly inferior to the studio version, but a nice touch all the same. This is a worthy purchase for all fans of Genesis, who'd like to see Steve Hackett in a different light."

          "text": "A classic, an album from golden era of Prog, Steve Hackett in the best shape, but most of all, the best presentation of his acoustic work crossed with Genesis style music (but after all, he is Genesis).Voyage of the Acolyte brings many melodies. Not cheap, not wonderful, but rather intriguing, the ones that gets under your skin. Yet it is also an album where few elements spoils the whole a bit. However, after every listen I get a feeling that this album wants to be loved. So gentle, so variable, so pleasing in every sense.Even the littleThe Loversis a bit interesting, even it is just a filler. And being to understand exact mood featured on trackHands Of The Priestess, Part Iwould be also fine. I never seem to get it right, it always puzzles me. In a good way.Nevertheless, I have some problems withA Tower Struck Down, but even it has its moments. Not much though.Shadow Of The Hierophantis a reprise of album's theme.4(+), for a great visionary, harmed only by 10% of bad parts + some repetition."

          "text": "Recorded by Steve Hackett with some Genesis pals in tow whilst the band were deliberating over their post-Gabriel direction, Voyage of the Acolyte is a brilliant showcase for Steve's skills - both as a guitar player and as a songwriter. I don't think it's a classic from beginning to end - I usually end up tuning out during the somewhat lukewarm \"la la la la\" vocal section on Star of Sirius - but it's packed with great music, from the super-complex Ace of Wands to the magnificent outro to Shadow of the Hierophant. Any fan of Hackett-era Genesis should make this their first stop in touring Steve's solo discography."

          "text": "One of the best and most characteristic progressive rock albums ever made, and Steve Hackett's finest moment as a composer. At it's best it surpasses Genesis, and at it's worst it's still around the same level as them. The music is very adventurous and imaginative with excellent use of contrasting moods and themes, Steve was (and still is) a brilliant writer and somewhat underused in Genesis so this album really made my day on first listen. The CD didn't leave the player for a month and the music is still as fresh now as it was back then. The musicianship have to be mentioned as well with bandmates Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins doing the rhythm section and brother John Hackett and John Acock on flute and keyboards respectively. Returning to a more song-oriented format on further releases, this is one of Hackett's most unique and rewarding albums, and absolutely essential for any starving proghead, preferably with a crush on Genesis. Highlights include the brilliant \"Ace of Wands\" and \"Star of Sirius\", the latter being sung by Phil Collins, two rollercoaster rides with splendid music. Essential."

          "text": "No doubt, Hackett's solo debut was and still is a wonderful record capturing all the instrumental and composing ideas Steve had accumulated during his GENESIS tenure but was prevented to \"sell\" them to the band-mates. So he decided to go solo. But this is very much GENESIS-sounding album, and if you are a fan of Gabriel-era GENESIS you should definitely get \"The Voyage of the Acolyte\"!There are lots of beautiful instrumental passages, pastoral feel of guitar solo, acoustic strings, mellotrons and flutes, symphonic arrangements, and above all, diversity. \"Hand of the Priestess\" carries the fine melodic snippets of what was probably left from the material Hackett composed for GENESIS album \"Selling England..\", while \"Tower Struck Down\" is an abrasive heavy guitar attack resembling some dark KING CRIMSON aspects. The highlight is perhaps \"The Star of Sirius\" with Phil Collins handling the lead vocals and is a typical multi-part progressive track of the GENESIS canon. Being an exceptional guitar player Hackett is much less of a vocalist, so \"The Hermit\" although nice ballad is probably the least strong track on the album. Another magnum opus is the closing \"Shadow of a Hierophant\" with female lead vocals by Sally Oldfield and some really wonderful weeping sound of Hackett's guitar and his brother John's flute. Of course, the opener \"Ace of Wands\" is a memorable instrumental composition and a furious starter to this lovely record.Absolutely essential to all listeners of \"symphonic\" type of classic prog.PERSONAL RATING: 4,75/5"

          "text": "First solo album from Steve and the only one released while still a member of Genesis. His reason for making this album (and later leaving Genesis) was he felt that not enough of his ideas were being used by the band. Some call this a 'lost Genesis album' and while I see where they are coming from I don't really agree. Some of the music here does sound like Genesis, while some of it is (gulp!) even better than Genesis! Both Collins and Rutherford appear on the album as well as other people, some more well known than others.The first half of this album is almost flawless. Generally I find a lot of the music too acoustic- y for my tastes. The use of synths here is more interesting than most of what Tony Banks was doing at the same time. The two best songs here, \"Ace Of Wands\" and \"A Tower Struck Down,\" are excellent tracks and, realistically, there is probably only 2 or 3 Genesis songs better than these two. That's how good they are. In fact, I would say that the last 2 minutes of \"Ace Of Wands\" is better than anything Genesis ever did. There, I said it.Opening the album with a drum fill and a guitar run, \"Ace Of Wands\" wastes no time getting to business. This track features some of Hackett's best guitar work on the album. Love the flute-like synth playing mixed with bells...awesome sound. I just love how it abruptly changes after 3 minutes to a face-paced section with acoustic guitar strumming and later some of Steve's trademark finger-tapping style. The two-part \"Hands Of The Priestess\" which segues between the other songs on side one features acoustic guitar, flute, Mellotron, backwards sounds as well as some mournful electric guitar. Good as segues but nothing special on their own.\"A Tower Struck Down\" is probably the single best song here and a lot darker and sinister sounding than almost anything Genesis did. Great interplay between the instruments. Love the sequencer pattern that appears after 2 minutes, very hypnotic. For a few seconds it gets interupted by random noises and then gets drowned out by a crowd yelling \"Steve Hackett!\" although it sounds like \"Sieg Heil!\" instead. Synth-generated thunderstorm sounds and then gorgeous Mellotron strings, followed by repeated minimal guitar. Fantastic song.\"The Hermit\" features Steve's own pedestrian vocals. Mostly acoustic guitar with some strings and some flute. Sort of a letdown after what came before but still a decent song. Phil Collins does lead vocals on \"Star Of Sirius.\" Starts off with acoustic guitar and Phil's multi-tracked vocals being joined by Mellotron. Nice synth melodies during the first half of this song. Oddly enough, this song does not sound very Genesis-y. Some vibraphone leads to the main upbeat portion of the track featuring acoustic guitar strumming and 'nah, nah, nah, nah' vocals.In the middle it gets dark sounding before some flute brings the sunshine back in. More synth melodies and vibraphone before the upbeat section returns. Probably Collins' best drumming on the album. \"The Lovers\" is a less than 2 minute instrumental that sounds like the first half is being played backwards during the second half. The almost 12 minute epic \"Shadow Of The Hierophant\" features Sally Oldfield (Mike's sister) on lead vocals. Very symphonic prog sounding. I'm not the biggest fan of Sally's voice but at least she can sing better than her brother (ha!). This is the longest song and it tends to lose my attention. Some cool finger-tapping from Steve; hard to believe this is from 1975 not 1985. The last part that builds up is the best part of the track.Hackett made a lot of great songs on his own but his albums were never very consistent. Voyage is probaly the most consistent of them all (although admittedly I haven't heard anything post-80s from him). This was recorded after Gabriel left Genesis and shows that, sooner or later, Genesis were going to end up a trio eventually anyway. This is worth it just for those two great tracks (you know which ones). I'll give this a 3.5 rounded up to 4 stars."

          "text": "This much-reviewed album is fondly admired by Genesis fans, and IMHO it's among the finest solo efforts of any (former) member of an acclaimed band. Quite an achievement for a debut! Made during the hiatus followed by Peter Gabriel's departure, it writes a crucial additional chapter in the story of Genesis. Worth noting is that Hackett collaborated with both Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford, and Collins also sang on one of the album's standout tracks, 'Star Of Sirius', perhaps paving way for the decision to become the lead vocalist for Genesis. The other guest vocalist is Sally Oldfield, whose high angelic voice is a perfect match with the delicate, romantic and symphonic music on the nearly 12-minute closer 'Shadow Of The Hierophant'.Taking its inspiration from the Tarot pack, the album is full of pastoral beauty with lots of acoustic instruments (brother John plays flute). Naturally Hackett also takes advantage of his chance to give the leading role to his masterful guitarism: the energetic instrumentals 'Ace Of Wands' and 'A Tower Struck Down' seem a bit too evident in that sense, but they give some kick amidst the soft and ethearal stuff (namely the dreamy isntrumental 'Hands of the Priestess' in two parts). 'The Hermit' is the most melancholic track, sung tenderly - and with an exaggerated vibrato - by Steve himself. The flute solo is lovely.On behalf of Genesis, I believe we all are grateful that Steve didn't leave them at this point. If you enjoy the more pastoral side of Genesis (e.g. on Wind & Wuthering), this is a must."

          "text": "\"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is the pinnacle of Steve Hackett's genius in many fans' eyes, and rightfully so as it boasts some of his most celebrated material. Any Hackett fan is enamoured with awesome tracks such as 'Ace of Wands', 'Star Of Sirius' and 'Shadow Of The Hierophant'.Many cite this as the missing Genesis album and it is easy to see why when you look at the lineup on the album. Steve Hackett plays electric & acoustic guitar, Mellotron, harmonium, bells, autoharp, vocal, effects, and he is joined by brother John Hackett on flute, Arp synthetizer, bells. But the real surprise treat is the addition of Mike Rutherford on bass guitar, bass pedals, Fuzz 12-String,and Phil Collins on drums, vibes, percussion, vocals. The collaboration feels more Genesis than one might imagine, and there are stirring performances from John Acock on Elka, Rhapsody, Mellotron, harmonium, piano and the beautiful tones of Sally Oldfield on vocals.'Ace of Wands' is a very melodic instrumental with delightful keyboards and of course Hackett is brilliant on lead guitar. This one has appeared on many concert setlists for good reason; a simply stunning start to the album. 'Hands of the Priestess Part I' is next, with a mystical feel and some gorgeous Mellotron and acoustics. The flute is dreamy as are the chimes; some of the most beautiful pastoral music I have heard.'A Tower Struck Down' is dramatic music with nice buzzing synth lines,rutherford's violent bassline, and odd meters with choral voices adding to the mystical flavour. It even has \"Sieg Heil!\" shouts at the end and explosions; a war of ideas, and then Mellotron swathes followed by low guitar tones. This is one of the proggiest tracks on the album. Followed by 'Hands Of The Priestess Part II' with more lovely flute and medieval sounds.After all the instrumental work, vocals soon enter the album. 'The Hermit' has the vocals of Steve Hackett echoed and phased in the studio, with a medieval lute. The flute passage is a gorgeous augmentation to end it.'Star Of Sirius' gives Phil Collins a chance to show he can sing. It is a peaceful song and has multi harmonies to disguise Collin's real voice; perhaps Hackett was worried about this. The music is keyboards and acoustics at first, then it builds into some nice melodies and definitely sounds like Genesis.'The Lovers' is a short transition with acoustic tranquillity, similar to 'Horizons' in some ways, except it feature backwards keyboards. 'Shadow Of The Hierophant' features the golden crystalline tones of Sally Oldfield, always a delight. It is the longest track at 11:44, and perhaps the masterpiece of the album. Oldfield's vocals lend a Celtic quality to the music as always, such an accomplished vocalist, and the flute and chimes are mesmirising.One of the greatest Hackett albums ever, \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is a delight from beginning to end, proggy and with virtuoso musicianship throughout. The songs and themes are based on Tarot, that never interested me, but I am very interested in the musicianship. Hackett proves he is going to make a solo career one day with this debut. He not only proves he will make it but he shows the other members of Genesis how it is done with that inimitable prog edge."

          "text": "'Voyage of the Acolyte' - Steve Hackett (8/10)The break-up of the progressive Genesis is one of the quiet tragedies of rock music. While the band technically lived to fight another day well into the eighties and beyond, the pop- oriented style was a world away from the bombastic prog epics they were first known for. In a sense, Genesis became a different band with the same name, and while I'm sure there are many out there who prefer the 80's pop- American Psycho's Patrick Bateman, for one- I'll always remember the band for their contributions to prog. Although Peter Gabriel's departure was the first nail in the coffin, it was Hackett's decision to leave that set the band's transformation in focus. Although the Genesis guitarist's solo debut \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" was released and recorded while he was still in the band, it is clear here that the main band was no longer scratching Steve Hackett's creative itch. With the same playful, cinematic guitar work and symphonic structures that defined much of Genesis' best work, paired with the fact that Steve is backed up here by fellow bandmembers, \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" may be seen as the route Genesis would have taken, had Hackett been given full control instead of Collins. Taking his distinctive style one step further, \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" comes close to bridging the gap between the archetypal rock band and symphonic orchestra. It may not feel as smooth as the refined masterpieces of Genesis proper, but Hackett's first foray into the solo realm is indeed spectacular.There's no surprise when \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" bears a strong resemblance to Genesis. Much like an orchestral symphony, the mood and style is complex, without ever being jarring on the ears. I read a comment once where it was said that Hackett was a master of the subconscious, and it certainly rings true here. In spite of (or perhaps because) the music is largely instrumental, there is a more otherworldly atmosphere here than the Gabriel-fueled romps through the farce of British working class society in early Genesis. The album art (painted by his wife, if I'm not mistaken) is a perfect counterpart to the mood. As always, Hackett's guitar tone is deep and meaty, and his playing reserved, melodic and rarely showy. It's well-assumed that the guitar element would play a heavier role here, but Hackett pays good consideration to the music as a whole. The synthesizers are allotted some of the most beautiful melodies on the album, and though Hackett's guitar is always doing something in the works, he seems less excited to sport his skills, and more enthusiastic about letting others spread their wings. Especially for the solo album of a guitar player- this is pretty rare. Suffice to say, there are no blistering guitar solos or longwinded 16 bar blues jams. Narcissistic musicians and listeners will no doubt feel alienated by this approach.\"Ace of Wands\" is a perfect way to open the album. Almost as were it an energetic overture of sorts, it is a highly dynamic instrumental piece that runs the spectrum from Celtic- influenced prog grooves to classical arrangements and the odd touch of ethereal atmosphere. The next three tracks run together as a longer piece, with \"A Tower Struck Down\" offering a near King Crimson-esque tension to contrast the relative lightness of \"Hand of the Priestess\". Thus far, \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" has been an entirely instrumental trip, and the lack of vocals gives Hackett the room to exercise his composition skills to their full potential. With the great success of this instrumental material in mind, it comes as something of a dull shock when Hackett's own voice is heard on the melancholic acoustic piece \"The Hermit\". The accompanying cello (performed here by Nigel Warren-Green) is a pleasantly dark accompaniment to the baroque sound of Hackett's acoustic arrangement. The vocals, however, feel quite ill-fitted for the sound. Although Hackett is not a poor vocalist by any means, his croon feels dry, muffled, and even poorly produced compared to the excellent instrumentation. \"Star of Sirius\" is arguably the most poppy tune here. Perhaps coincidentally, Phil Collins offers his voice here, and though his vocal delivery is much more effective than Hackett's on \"The Hermit\", the music runs into a similar problem; the production feels less professional than it did when the music was purely instrumental. It's as if \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is self-aware that the instrumental material thus far is superior, and wants to draw a bolder line between the two. The result is that \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" comes across as a bit of an uneven record, at least relative to its studio success.\"The Lovers\" is a short acoustic interlude, the likes of which we have seen before from Hackett on \"Foxtrot\"s own \"Horizons\". Being little more than a slow exercise in fingerpicking, it's largely benign. However, it's given the great honour of being the extended introduction for \"Shadow of the Hierophant\", the mandatory prog epic that closes off the record. It's here where everything comes together; all of Hackett's scattered pieces coalesce into something monstrous, beautiful, alien and intimate. Although it flirts with the eleven minute mark, \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" is a surprisingly minimalistic composition, relying largely on two motifs to get by, one soft and vocal-driven, the other more anthemic and proggy. It may have felt slightly longwinded, had it not been one of the most beautifully composed and performed things Steve Hackett has ever touched. Thanks in large part to guest vocalist Sally Oldfield's incredibly pristine voice, \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" forgives its slightly weaker midsection and delivers something straight out of a world of fantasy. Sally's voice really cannot be overestimated here, her vibrato and floating quality gives her the voice the semblance of an angel. Fused with Steve Hackett's classical ambitions and moderate Celtic influences, it's something really wonderful. The repeating final section does tend to feel a tad overextended by the end, but there's no mistaking that \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" leaves its best for last; really wonderful stuff.It will no doubt be exciting for someone to listen to Steve Hackett's debut, especially if they're any fan of the progressive-era Genesis. If Genesis could be seen as an earthy form of progressive rock, then \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is somewhere between that and the aether, where Yes have claimed their perch. For whatever reason, the album feels uneven in the way it was recorded. It certainly opens and ends on its strongest notes, and while there is a consistent beauty throughout the music here, I cannot help but feel that the album could have been even better, had the flow come across a little more smoothly. It's not perfect, but it's some of the most vital Hackett's creativity has ever felt."

          "text": "In retrospect, making a solo album at this point in time might have been a somewhat jerkish move on the part of Steve. In the wake of Peter Gabriel's departure from Genesis, the band was in a bit of an uncertain place, and one could argue that everybody in the band should have been focusing all of their energies on figuring out how the new look Genesis was going to move forward. Instead, almost as soon as theLambtour was over and Peter was officially out of the band, Steve took the opportunity to spend a month recording his debut solo album, and his involvement in relation to various aspects caused him to miss early rehearsals forA Trick of the Tail. Feelings couldn't have been too hard at the time, though; while Tony Banks is nowhere to be found, Mike Rutherford handles the bulk of the bass guitar work, and Phil Collins contributes all of the percussion and even sings on one of the tracks. Who knows, maybe Mike and Phil decided that they couldn't risk any bad blood on the part of Steve, so they decided it would be a good idea to help him out, or maybe they were eager to get back to playing non-Lambmaterial together as soon as possible.This is a 1000% prog rock album. Five of the eight tracks are instrumental, the song names all reference Tarot cards, the lyrics might as well be sung in French, and everything about the album screams out THIS IS SERIOUS MUSIC FOR SERIOUS LISTENERS. From a certain perspective, it's a far more concentrated dose of prog rock on the whole than any Genesis album to that point; yes, Genesis albums had their fair share of \"serious\" music, but they also had a tendency to lighten the mood at just the right times (the lighter songs are often an irritant for Genesis fans, but I think the consistent of inclusion of such material was one of the great strengths of the Gabriel era of Genesis). On this album, the music may sometimes get gentle, but it never remotely approacheslightweight, and this both helps and hurts the album. Steve was still a little bit away at this point from his future tendencies to mix things up, that's for sure.Still, this album makes for a delightful listen, and part of this is because the sonic texture is far more varied than on a given Genesis album. Aside from the standard instrumentation, Steve's brother John contributes flute, and there are contributions from others on oboe, English horn and cello. There's still plenty of keyboard - Steve wasn't going to abandon one of the most important foundations of solid art rock just because Tony didn't want to help out - but the keyboard parts are very much a part of the ensemble, as opposed to an entity showing much personality (which, for better and worse, Tony Banks' keyboard parts always had). The star, though, is clearly Steve's guitar, and my does he take advantage of his new freedom. If you've ever felt any sense that Steve was underused relative to his abilities in Genesis, then the opening \"Ace of Wands\" will reinforce that feeling something fierce. Yes, the song is more than just a guitar showcase; all of the various parts are memorable, and there are solid sequences where the majestic keyboards become the focus and the guitars fade into the background. Ultimately, though, the song's most notable features come from its rapid dash from guitar lick to guitar lick, some electric and some acoustic, with Steve mixing speed and minimalism in the way only he could and showing a stronger guitar tone than on most of his Genesis work.\"Hands of the Priestess I\" and \"Hands of the Priestess II,\" which sandwich \"A Tower Struck Down,\" show off Steve's skills at making gentle instrumental music (whereas \"Ace of Wands\" and \"A Tower Struck Down\" show his skills in making energetic instrumental music). The first part features John's flute and Steve's guitar going back and forth on an atmospheric melody over a soft acoustic part, and the second part brings out a happy exchange of flute, English horn and guitar, with a momentary reprise of one of the themes briefly played in the middle of \"Ace of Wands.\" \"A Tower Struck Down,\" in contrast, would be a borderline heavy number if the guitar and the bass didn't sound so goofily wimpy (which is all the stranger given that there are two people playing bass in the song); I like the song, and it has multiple interesting sections (and some GREAT atmospheric keyboard parts in the middle), but the song almost sounds unfinished in spots (in contrast, the version onGenesis Revisited IIdecades later sounds fantastic).The first vocal on the album comes from Steve on \"The Hermit,\" and while he's no great shakes, he's definitely not bad either, though to be fair the vocal melody (a fairly nice idea repeated over and over) doesn't require much of him. The song itself is quite lovely, though; the melody goes nowhere, but it's an atmospheric nowhere, and the arrangements (especially the fantastic solo by the oboe or English horn, I admit I'm not 100% which) are very pleasing to my ears. \"Star of Sirius\" is a more upbeat acoustic ballad, this time featuring Phil on vocals, but Phil is basically just another layer in the delightful atmosphere whenever he sings. No matter, the slower parts are beautiful, and the faster parts give another opportunity to hear Steve doing his speedy minimalism thing oh so well.After another instrumental, the classical-guitar-turns-into-ambience of \"The Lovers\" (only 1:50), we come to the album's finale and defining track. \"The Shadow of the Hierophant\" (which has enough contributions from Mike that it warranted a songwriting co-credit) is about as pompous as prog can get without crossing a suckiness line, and all the better for it. The first half (the vocal half) is basically two ideas alternating back and forth; a fantastic slow guitar line supported by STRONG keyboards, and an acoustic ballad with Sally Oldfield singing lyrics I still don't remotely know after owning the album for a very long time (aside from an occasional \"Has the moon eclipsed the sun\"). Honestly, I don't care that I don't know the lyrics; the singing is so lush, and the vocal melody so beautiful, that I'm perfectly willing to let the song have the same effect on me it would have if I was listening to something from an opera (where I wouldn't know the words because I wouldn't speak the language). Once the \"song\" portion ends, Steve breaks into the most emotionally charged 40-second tapping sequence I can imagine, before pulling out a brief guitar melody that rivals anything he did with Genesis, and the ending sequence begins. Oh, that ending sequence. It's just one relatively simple theme, repeated over and over (starting on solo vibes before the guitar comes in), building into a more and more dramatic arrangement, over the course of five minutes. I listen to it, and I know it's not much, and I know on a certain level it's a giant put-on, but it's just such a giant steam-roller of sound and power and that I can't get myself to care. It's one of the best stretches in Steve's career, that's for sure, and it helps make the track into one of the best of Steve's career.On the whole, this is also one of the best albums of Steve's career, but I'd still say it falls a smidge short of greatness. It's just a touch short of genuinely classic tracks, and it has some stretches (like in much of \"Tower\") that don't sound quite right, and quite honestly it sounds much closer to a generic prog album than it does to the sort of album that Steve would be making later. But if it doesn't quite make it to greatness, it's still awfully close. Fans of 70s Genesis, and 70s prog rock in general, should be all over this."

          "text": "Review N\ufffd 322\"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" is the debut solo studio album of Steve Hackett and was released in 1975. \"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" is also the first solo album to be released by any member or ex-member of Genesis. \"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" was releasead before \"The Geese And The Ghost\" and \"Peter Gabriel (1 ? \"Car\")\" of Anthony Phillips and Peter Gabriel, respectively, both released in 1977, \"A Curious Feeling\" of Tony Banks which was released in 1979, \"Smallcreep's Day\" of Mike Rutherford which was released in 1980 and \"Face Value\" of Phil Collins which was released in 1981.Steve Hackett invited to participate on his debut solo studio album two of his fellow members of Genesis, in those times, Rutherford and Collins, and some other fine musicians too. So, the line up on the album is Steve Hackett (electric and acoustic guitars, mellotron, harmonium, bells, autoharp and effects), Mike Rutherford (bass guitar, bass pedals and 12 string fuzz-bass), Phil Collins (vocals, drums, vibes and percussion), John Hackett (flute, ARP synthesizer and bells), John Acock (Elka synthesizer, mellotron, harmonium and piano), Sally Oldfield (vocals), Robin Miller (oboe and English horn), Nigel Warren-Green (cello), Percy Jones (bass guitar) and Johnny Gustafson (bass guitar).\"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" has eight tracks. All tracks were written by Steve, except track three written by Steve and John and track eight written by Steve and Rutherford. The first track \"Ace Of Wands\" is a great opener for the album. It has a violent entrance with a very complex Steve's guitar work, and it has also great individual performances by Collins on drums and by his brother John with a very aggressive flute work. The result is a promising track with great some parts. This is one of the best tracks on the album. The second track \"Hands Of The Priestess I\" is a short, very calm and beautiful acoustic piece of music with the unmistakable Steve's guitar style, very well accompanied by his brother's flute work. The third track \"A Tower Struck Down\" is the most unusual song on the album. It has a very dark style, and is somewhat unexpected. It's a less melodic song, more experimental and that reminds me King Crimson, especially due to the way how the mellotron was used. It remains another great track but it's the least accessible number from the album. The fourth track \"Hands Of The Priestess II\" is the smallest song on the album and is a kind of a remake of the first part of \"Hands Of The Priestess I\". It's a very beautiful and melancholic song with some nice keyboards, and one more time, we have a beautiful John's flute work. The fifth track \"The Hermit\" is another calm, soft, beautiful and melancholic song on the album, but this time with Steve's vocals. Who knows Steve well, knows he isn't a vocalist and that he hasn't properly a great voice. However, on this song, his voice is very decent and pretty and is very well accompanied by a great guitar work. I particularly like very much the combination of the acoustic guitar work and great keyboards. The sixth track \"Star Of Sirius\" is the second lengthiest song on the album and is also one of the best, most diverse and complex tracks on the album. This is the track that many say it's a Genesis' song. It has Collins singing and practically everything on the song sounds like Genesis. It's extremely atmospheric, but also goes though a few upbeat sections. The seventh track \"The Lovers\" is the other smallest song on the album and is also another classic mellow acoustic nice track. It's a track perfectly in the same vein of \"Horizon\" of \"Foxtrot\". The eighth track \"Shadow Of The Hierophant\" is, in my humble opinion, the great epic, the highest point on the album. This is really a majestic closer to it. Some of you wrote that think this track is too long and that makes of it a boring song. I completely disagree with that opinion. This is, for me, a fantastic, memorable and beautiful piece of music, a real masterpiece, with the beautiful and superb voice of Sally. I think this musical piece is strongly influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach, the German classical Baroque composer. That isn't surprising, because many of we know the Steve's passion by this classical composer.Conclusion: \"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" marks an extraordinary beginning of an ongoing career. Many fans consider this his finest work. I remember this release has shocked many fans in those times. Genesis had lost their front man and supposedly their music mastermind too. So, the future of the group seemed uncertain. Was Steve's solo debut another indication that the band was breaking up? Being the first one to release a solo work surprised many people because on Genesis, he always seemed to be the most unobtrusive of all. \"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" is the best debut solo album released by any member or ex-member of Genesis. It's, in many ways, almost a lost Genesis' album, because it features Collins and Rutherford, because it comes out in the wake of Gabriel's departure from the group and also because there are many similarities with the music sound of Genesis. In my humble opinion, \"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" is at the same level of \"A Trick Of The Tail\" and \"Wind And Wuthering\", and is also something more progressive and innovative than these two albums. So, \"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" is a wonderful masterpiece that doesn't deserves less than 5 stars.Prog is my Ferrari. Jem Godfrey (Frost*)"

          "text": "In the midst of uncertainty about the future of Genesis due to the resignation of Peter Gabriel after the conceptual \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\", Steve Hackett decides to release his first solo album, \"Voyage of the Acolyte\". Freed from the limits and conventions that being part of a band often demands, but at the same time counting on the participation of his bandmates Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford, Hackett relies on the mysterious secrets hidden by the characters of the Tarot cards, to give the album a significant halo of mysticism and depth.From the nervous \"Aces of Wands\" and its voluble moods, where Hackett's aseptic guitars yield and recover spaces in constant synchrony with the synthesizers and Collins' anxious drums, \"Voyage of Acolyte\" combines moments of diaphanous appearance as in the two \"Hands of the Priestess\" and its celestial acoustic arpeggios and fragile flutes, or the aching \"The Hermit\", with the forcefulness of the genesian and robust \"A Tower Struck Down\" and the gentle bipolarity of \"Star of Sirius\", sung by Collins and immersed in relaxed landscapes tinged with lively moments, a hint of the immediate future of post Gabriel Genesis (\"A Trick of the Tail\" and \"Wind of Wuthering\" for instance).However, the track that unites all the traversed paths into one is \"Shadow of the Hierophant\". Discarded by Genesis during the recording process of \"Foxtrot\", the piece combines beautiful arpeggios, the soprano voice of Sally Oldfield, sister of the tubular musician, with an instrumentation that grows in intensity led by the keyboards until the end. One of the best of the album and probably also of Hackett's solo discography.\"Voyage of the Acolyte\" is not only the debut album of Hackett, one of the most representative and influential guitarists of the genre, but the beginning of his extensive solo career.Excellent.4/4.5 stars"

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "biography": "Stephen Richard Hackett\n\n- Born February 12th 1950 (Pimlico, London, UK)\n\nGUITAR BASED MUSIC WITH VARIOUS STYLES\n\n(Blues, Classical, Folk, Jazz, New Age and Progressive Rock)\n\nSteve HACKETT needs no introduction. He is definitely one of the major guitarists of this century. Ex-GENESIS, he is now a major force in the domain of music composed for guitar, rock as well as classical. Steve is a complex musician, drawing influence from a wide variety of styles and melding them into super compositions. His music has evolved over the years, and while some of it was not up to the standards that he set with other albums. They are still excellent.\n\nHACKETT joined\n\nGENESIS\n\nas guitarist in early 1971 and featured across ten albums of their history. He replaced Anthony PHILLIPS, and stayed with the band during their successful mid-70s progressive rock period. I remember once reading that, if GENESIS lost their \"brains\" when Peter GABRIEL left, then they surely lost their \"heart\" when Steve left. In a way, it is easy to see how HACKETT was \"crowded out\" of Genesis in 1977. From \"Nursery Crime\" in 1971 to the double-live \"Seconds Out\" in 1977, he created in his solo albums his own style, dominated by his guitars, sometimes very classical or at times furious. His tracks go from a symphonic Progressive style to a more energetic rock.\n\nFrom the first album \"Voyage Of The Acolyte\" while he was still with GENESIS to his most recent ones, all are MUSTS. For the most part, all of the compositions on HACKETT's first five solo albums are well-thought-out and impeccably well crafted. I would highly recommend \"Voyage of the Acolyte\" (missing GENESIS album), \"Please Don't Touch\" (powerful), his TRADEMARK \"Spectral Mornings\" (pure magic), \"Defector\" (another amazing album by Steve), and \"Cured\" (pop-oriented). This, along with \"Time Lapse\", \"The Unauthorised Biography\", \"Guitar Noir\", \"Darktown\" and \"To Watch The Storms\", are the best for people curious about the HACKETT \"feel\". However I believe these are his bests - it could rightly be called \"THE HISTORY OF MUSIC ACCORDING TO STEVE HACKETT.\" Get them ALL...and HAPPY LISTENING!!!\n\nDiscography with GENESIS (1971-1982):\n\n1971 - Nursery Crime\n\n1972 - Foxtrot\n\n1973 - Live\n\n1973 - Selling England By The Pound\n\n1974 - Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\n\n1976 - Wind and Wuthering\n\n1976 - Trick of the Tail\n\n1977 - Seconds Out\n\n1982 - Three Sides Live\n\nSee also:\n\n-\n\nGTR\n\n-\n\nSQUACKETT\n\n-\n\nDJABE\n\n-\n\nJohn HACKETT",

From the sweetness of \"Kayleigh\" to the edgy jokiness of \"Lavender,\" from the solid-rock brilliance of \"Heart of Lothian\" (one of the best rockers in prog-rock) to the cathartic \"Childhood's End,\" Fish & Co. are at their combined musical peak here.

          "text": "Marillion's excellent 1985 album MISPLACED CHILDHOOD lends considerable weight to the argument that not all the best progressive rock was written in the 70s. Granted, this recording could never have happened if Genesis hadn't first blazed the trail that Marillion follow so well here, but that's just the way that art often develops. Marillion may be inspired by Genesis, but wasn't the music of Beethoven an edifice built upon the foundation that Hayden and others had laid? Regarding the often-leveled charge of Fish's vocals being \"imitative\" of Gabriel's, I find it well within the realm of probability that two people could have very similar singing voices, and conclude \"lucky me!\" Having more musical choices is always good, and I simply like to hear Fish sing, passionately fronting this very polished and powerful band!In classic \"prog\" fashion, MISPLACED CHILDHOOD is a concept album in which all the tracks run together in a seamless whole. The excellent, often moving lyrics give an account of loneliness, lost love, substance abuse, the shallowness of fame, man's inhumanity to man, and -- most poignantly of all -- a longing for the lost innocence of childhood. This sentiment is beautifully captured in \"Lavender,\" as a Mother Goose rhyme is masterfully and magically transformed into a touching love song, complete with a singing lead guitar courtesy of Steve Rothery (whose cutting licks delightfully recall those of fellow \"Steve\" Hackett!)Though the album's words take us through some bitter emotional territory, the music is varied, compelling (if overtly derivative) and evocative of its subject matter throughout. The final message is not one of despair, however, as the dawning of wisdom, the reclamation of the spirit of wonder, and the realization of the limitlessness of the future is effectively portrayed in the final two triumphal and cathartic songs, \"Childhood's End\" and \"White Feather.\"In keeping with its theme, MISPLACED CHILDHOOD shone out like a beacon of hope for the future of progressive rock in the 80s, and still thrills today! It is recordings like this one, made some ten years after the heydays of it progenitors, that give me continued faith in the future of the genre. A latter-day progressive rock classic!"

Songs range from the quiet chambers of Lavender to the psychedelic sounds of the Watering Hole. \"Misplaced ...\" also had a fair amount of commercial success and is perhaps their best known work. I also agree with the masses on this one and \"Kayleigh\" still remains one of those songs which has touched my soul. The album is so very well constructed and works well to its completion. FISH sings at his best here and surprisengly the album does not carry an over produced feel to it."

After all the glowing praise for this album and this band, I was ready to heave off my bias against post-70's prog and revel in an absolute masterpiece. Instead I was introduced to a singer who makes me want to vomit being backed by a crew of anonymous, unremarkable musicians. Fans of classic prog (Gentle Giant, Yes, ELP) take note: you won't find anything remotely like that here. To the more \"open minded\" listener (or maybe a semi-deaf Genesis fanatic), this may end up a dear treasure to you like it is to so many others. Your call, best of luck."

          "text": "Growing up in publicAfter a couple of early album which, while competent and enjoyable, sounded a bit too like (Gabriel era) Genesis tribute albums, Marillion suddenly found their own identity with \"Misplaced Childhood\".Nominally a concept album, this is not so much a story, as series of individual tracks blended together to form a coherent, beautifully constructed piece (as Genesis did with \"Supper's Ready\"). The album opens withorchestralkeyboards introducing Fish on the brief but melodic \"Pseudo silk kimono\". This leads into a couple of what might be considered surprise hit singles. \"Kayleigh\" (a name which Fish apparently conjured up from the names Kay and Leigh, but which led to a generation of similarly named female offspring!), and \"Lavender\", an interpretation of the \"Lavender blue\" nursery rhyme song. These two tracks manage to achieve the usually elusive feat of blending in completely on a classic prog rock album, while simultaneously holding a wide commercial appeal.The \"Lavender\" theme reappears in instrumental form later on side one, as part of a powerful lead up to the closing track (on LP side one), \"Heart of Lothian\". The title of this track relates to Fish's Scottish heritage, Lothian being the area in which the city Edinburgh is located (one of the city's football clubs is \"Heart of Mid-Lothian\"). Side 2 is the slightly weaker side, but it's all relative, and in CD format the album flows well from start to finish.In summary the best album by far from the Fish era, and possibly the best Marillion album to date.A special 2 CD edition was released a few years ago, containing studio rehearsals of the final tracks."

The 2 ballads Kayleigh and Lavender are really essential: they give to the album a romantic touch; that's why many young female teenagers like this album! The romantic moods are also present in many other parts of the album, because of guitar and keyboards arrangements. Many heavy metal fans like this album, because of the guitar. Finally, the music is complex enough to be liked by real prog fans in search of always more sophisticated albums.Extremely recommended!"

          "text": "SUPERB! This is the band's third album and the best that this band has ever produced to-date (2004). This is now 19 years after release date and I still consider this album still a MASTERPIECE. This album would not die with a passage of time.In my opinion, there are two things that bound to any kind of music: 1.) the story that the musicians want to tell the listeners, and 2.) the structural integrity of the music composition itself. This album has fulfilled both excellently. As Fish described the first three albums in the MC sheet music book as \"SCRIPT was bedsit thoughts, FUGAZI was hotel thoughts and MC is home thoughts.\", some lyrics in this album can be considered as too personal with some of them touch the national pride as well. But the beauty of it is that anyone who listens to this story may relate with his / her own, assuming (for example) \"Kayleigh\" synonymous with his girlfriend. Anyone can also relate the \"I was born with the heart of Lothian\" with their own interpretation of \"Lothian\" or any national anthem. I think this is the strong point of this album, story-wise, as it was born from actual experience of the lyricist. Be it a real story or an imagination.For those of you who are new in prog rock, this album is a must. You won't regret as there are \"ear candy\" pop stuffs like \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\" as as well as nice melody and stunning prog music. The music of MC is beautifully crafted, well structured in terms of composition. All 10 songs were organized into two parts. I guess this is due to the availability of two-side LP when the album was created. Otherwise it would be a one piece of music. Again, with this album I admire highly on the band's ability to create a nice, natural and smooth TRANSITION between chapters in a song and between songs. The transitions piece, I think, has successfully accentuated the story and created a solid music nuances. Considering this is a concept album, there is NO tag line melody that is typically used repeatedly throughout the album. Each song carries its own melody and identity. Mixed together, they create a great music composition. This makes the album is worthy for exploration. With this album, you would hardly compare MARILLION with GENESIS. MARILLION is different.DETAILS: (for those of you who want to explore further. Otherwise, just BUY the CD! The 2 CD version is better as later you would enjoy the other version of MC. You should listen to CD 2 after you get used to CD1.)\"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" with a howling keyboard sound and heavy voice of Fish \"Huddled in the city of pseudo silk kimono wearing bracelets of smoke ..\" has a dense in mood. Rothery's guitar work at the background is really nice. Disappearing sound of \"Pseudo ..\" was then followed with a nice keyboard intro of \"Kayleigh\". It's a catchy transition here. \"Do you remember?\". This track transcends various relationships that Fish had experienced with bitter end as he was so committed with his career to be a famous singer. Again, at he end of this track a piano sound brings the music to \"Lavender\" nicely.In the first part of \"Bitter Suite\" Fish sings in a poet reading style \"A spider wanders aimlessly ..etc.\" . The music has transformed to a little bit spacey kind of music. The only unique thing is at vocals here. The tone has then climbed up when he sings \"A train sleeps in a siding .. etc\". This part ends nicely with \"Her mother said she's beautiful, her daddy said 'a whore'\". Terrific piece, melodically really!I consider \"Bitter Suite\" is the trunk, melody-wise, of the album especially when at the third part (Blue Angel) when Fish sings \"J'entend ton Coeur\" the music moves fabulously with slow piano, keyboard and guitar sounds to the beautiful melody of fourth part (Misplaced Rendezvous). \"It's getting late .etc.\" Woooowwww!!!! What a wonderful piece here, my friend!! It's damn nice! But the ecstasy has not ended yet as when the lyric part reaches \"The parallel of you .. you\" yeaaah .. another nice piece! It then bring you to fifth part (Windswept Thumb) \"On the outskirts of nowhere ..\" .The climax is really at the \"Heart of Lothian\" where the music brings together to a relatively higher tempo than the preceding tracks. \"Wide boys! Wide boys!\". It rocks! I admire Fish technical ability to sing seamlessly \"rooting tooting cowboys, Lucky little ladies at the watering holes .\".Part 2 (B side) is much energetic and really stunning. The band does not allow any poppy touch in any of five tracks that make up Part 2. Opened with a high energy \"Waterhole / Expresso Bongo\" with dazzling percussion and drumming sounds, high tone vocal, this track sets the whole tone of Part 2. You may observe how brilliant the transition between this track to the next \"Lords of the Backstage\". \"A love song with validity ..\" and \"I just wanted you to be the first one ..\" are the lyric parts that people used to emulate. They have nice melody!Hey, I bet you would say the next track \"Blind Curve\" is another really (really) wonderful track! I never imagined that human kind could create a very stunning, well structured, and nice melody musical composition as great as this track. From \"Last night you said I was cold ..\" to \"Strung out under necklace ..\" to \"Oh I remember Toronto .\"My childhood .. misplaced childhood ..\" to \"I saw a war widow .\" all are brilliant music pieces! It might require 3-page review for this track only. It's really a great track!The other two tracks are excellent also. \"I will wear your white feather / I will carry your white flag. I will swear I have no nation / But I'm proud to own my heart\" is a nice lyric of a concluding track \"White Feather\". Relating to reading a book, it seems to me that the concluding track is like the ending of the story. Brilliant work!So, what do you think? - Gatot Widayanto, Indonesia."

It is excellent, although the first couple of times I heard it I wasn't that impressed. However, the music grew on me, and now I rate it their third best album ever, just behind Script and Clutching at Straws. The music flows nicely, and there is true atmosphere and power in each piece of music. Lyrics, as always when Fish lead the band, are superb, deep but understandable, and almost poetical. Each track has something to recommend it, although for me, ironically, the weakest track is the overrated 'Kayleigh', which is nowhere near as good as it is made out. (Strangely, an old friend of mine, who hated Marillion, actually said that was the only track of theirs he liked!) Nevertheless, I would recommend this to any prog fan."

People with a Marillion shirt would generate 2 reactions: 1) Did this guy slept in a freezer and woke up from '85? 2) Yuck. I come from Quebec City okay? I know Marillion had their 15 minutes here. They were the first part of Rush in the Power Windows Tour. And Rush got booed when they hit the stage 'cuz people wanted more Marillion. Rush got booed! By Marillion! Good god, sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. And it's true, FM prog is not very popular. I never understood neo-prog. I want to, I honestly do. And I wouldn't mind liking it either. There is so many recommended bands in that catergorie. Sigh* Anyway, this record is great. Storytelling and lyrics are close to memorable. Fish has a knack with agencing words that sounds great together. Hey, where could you find poetry lines like pseudo silk kimono, diamonds trapped in black ice, cemetary eyes, moonwashed colored halls... In this case, Fish has talent to write great lyrics that makes ideas pop-up immediately in your cranium. I like this album. It's quite catchy and the songs stand on their feet. It's far away in quality from almost everything produced today, so it deserves an ear. I know I've been VERY mean to Marillion before and I do feel that...only idiots don't change their minds. Dereck Dick really created a world of mystery and fantastic covers and illustrations (just check the singles cover art....pure beauty). Maybe because I have a fondness for comic books, but the Marillion-art is breathtaking. We could easily make comic heroes with that. Part of the band like Iron Maiden art was. Anyway, this album for me was a gentle and very pleasent entry in the neo-prog vein. And by the way, in college, there was a boy with a Clutching at Straws cd in his Discman. He was hanging out with the gang who swore to get the head of Fish on a stick (fishstick). He was bending his head in shame while watching helpless students get laughed at for sporting a shirt of their favorite band. That quiet kid, too afraid of getting the disapprobation....was me."

I liked the song very much. One day in early 1987 I went to a record shop, and I found several Marillion albums, except \"Brief Enounter\", but I found \"Misplaced Childhood\". This album is Marillion`s best album with Fish, and is one of their albums that I still like to listen to. It`s an album full of great music, with many emotions in all the songs. I stopped buying Marillion`s albums after \"Holidays in Eden\", an album I don`t like. Maybe \"Misplaced Childhood\" is one of those albums ( like \"The Dark Side of the Moon\") that never sound dated. The cover is also very good. If someone who doesn`t know the band wants to buy one of Marillion`s albums, this album is the best choice."

          "text": "Marillion - Misplaced ChildhoodThis is one of those albums which are only good if you look at the whole package instead of the separate songs. Considering the songs as individual tracks I would say a maximum of 2 stars would be possible. Separately seen, there are only two songs on the album which I think are superb: that is the epicBlind Curvetrack and the moody opening songPseudo Silk Kimono; the first being a long suite with various changes in moods -varying from light and optimistic to dark and depressing- and great instrumentation. The second being a very dark and brooding song which only features layers of synthesizer sounds and Fish's distinctive vocals.If I look at Marillion's Misplaced Childhood album as a concept album instead of a collection of individual -sometimes linked- songs, I can enjoy the album a lot more. This probably has to do with the fact that all together the album tells the listener a story, a bit depressing story, but hey, it is the Fish who is writing the lyrics, so that sort of speaks for itself.His lyrics are again very poetic and dramatic, but this album shows a bit of a change regarding the complexity of his lyrics. The meaning of his words are more obvious than on the previous Script for a Jester's Tear and Fugazi albums. This is a good transition with the last Fish-era Marillion album, 1987's Clutching at Straws -that album included lyrics that were even more down to earth than those found on this album. I always felt that the albums that Marillion wrote with Fish on vocals were one big suite, starting with Script for a Jester's Tear and ending with Clutching at Straws. Displaying the somehowMisplacedlife of the Fish man. Misplaced Childhood is no exception and can really be seen as part three in this series of autobiographic pieces of art."

          "text": "In many ways this album is Marillion's most significant recording: \"Misplaced Childhood\" was not only their most successful album, but also the one in which the romantic essence of singer/lyricist Fish's heart met its most solid expression in musical terms: definitely, the communion between the four instrumentalists' ideas and Fish's tormented intimate imagery is 100 % cohesive in this absolute neo-prog cornerstone. Fish is no longer a singer who sometimes witnesses his surroundings and some other times looks into himself - for \"Misplaced Childhood\" he actually is what he sings about. Right from the vibrating melancholy displayed in the synth harmonies of the opener 'Pseudo-Silk Kimono' you can tell that this is going to be a sentimental journey of overwhelming proportions: this song's lyrics announce the prelude to an attempt to move over a period of infinite sadness, which means that the first step to be taken is look it straight in the eyes in order to trace back its roots and be prepared for redemption. Fish is no longer a singer who sometimes witnesses his surroundings and some other times looks into himself - he actually is what he sings about. Kelly's labour throughout the album is more subdued than in Marillion's previous two efforts, but still his keyboards are the most prominent sonic source: his orchestrations and harmonic layers (plus some occasional solos) serve as the repertoire's crucial focus around which Rothery's melodic sensitivity and Trewavas/Mosley's effective rhythmic foundation create the successive moods for all the diverse sections comprised in the album. By now, Marillion stands closer to \"The Wall\"-era Pink Floyd than Gabriel-era Genesis. 'Kayleigh' is a classic prog ballad, a sad invocation for regret and self-blame: immediately after, 'Lavender' brings the hope of wishful thinking under a nursery rhyme-meets-Elton John's guise. This other ballad is more properly a transitional passage between 'Kayleigh' and 'Bitter Suite', the first of two suites contained in \"Misplaced Childhood\". Kicking off with a psychedelic instrumental section, things start to acquire a form with the sequence of bass drum and bass that sustains the keyboard and guitar's combined layers and Fish's first opening lines; then comes a brief Latin-jazz oriented bridge, followed by two slow tempo motifs. The 2-part 'Heart of Lothian' brings some Celtic-like stuff in Rothery's guitar leads and Kelly's complementing counter-leads during the 'Wide Boy' portion: the band manages to confidently shift from 7/8 to 5/4 to 4/4 seamlessly in a fluid continuum. 'Waterhole' finds the band displaying an exotic Arabesque motif with a rocky rough edge before turning into the syncopated mood of 'Lords of the Backstage'. 'Blind Curve' is the most complex of both suites, and it should be, since it contains the crucial turning point in the lyrics. The first three slow tempo motifs continue to explore the misery and solitude of the rock star and his unhealed wounds from the past, until the mesmeric presence of a child makes our hero aware of his urgent need to recover his lost innocence in order to stop his unhealthy appetite for self-destruction ('Perimeter Walk'); this weird experience allows him to open his eyes to the world and transcend his mere individuality ('Threshold'). That's when the celebratory spirit of 'Childhoods End?' comes in: this catchy number is more than a simplistic single-oriented song (something like 'Follow You Follow Me'-meets-'Every Little Thing She Does is Magic'), it's a manifesto of hope reborn. I see the march of merry children depicted in the Celtic-oriented 'White Feather' as a sharing of the truth that our hero has discovered about the very depths of human nature - innocence is the key to our will power. This happy ending is not without drama: the emotional tension still pervades the most optimistic tracks, but again, emotional tension is what \"Misplaced Childhood\" is all about. One noticeable minus point is Fish's decreased vocal energy: his dangerous drinking habits were starting to burn out his voice - but this is not a handicap for the band's overall effort, it's just a detail that does not essentially affect Fish's capability to convey genuine emotion through his singing. Rating: 4.25 stars for this album, not as powerful as \"Fugazi\" (my fave marillion album), but still brilliant in its own terms."

          "text": "Casting aside the pop tune, 'Kayleigh', this album has a very nice flow to it. One song melds into the next flawlessly. I'm not a big fan of concept albums and Fish, in my view, is not the best singer in the world, but the man can write some deep lyrics, just don't try to understand them while listening. My only gripe with this album and Marillion as a whole is that it's Fish's vehicle and damn if it's not going to be a depressing affair. Sure, there's some upbeat numbers, especially my two favorites on the album, 'Waterhole' leading into 'Lords of The Backstage'. But, for the most part, the songs tend to have the same tempo. Guitar is in the out front with Fish, while keyboards are mainly window dressing, unlike the first two albums which have more variety musically. Still, taking it all in, the album is wonderfully produced, crystal clear and is definately a solid work. More excellent, than good, it warrants four stars. But just barely! On a side note, I saw them play this album from beginning to end when they opened up for Rush back in '85. It was more powerful live and I recall Fish's voice being exceptional. Be it as it may, a live recording of that concert would still get the same rating..."

          "text": "The most accessible and accomplished of the FISH-era MARILLION albums, Misplaced Childhood's most notable achievement is the seamless integration of well-conceived musical and lyrical motifs into a seamless concept album.A first-time listener should not be put off by the undoubtedly commercial 'Kayleigh' and 'Lavender', as these short songs lend their central themes to the more progressive developments later in the album. This makes Misplaced Childhood a whole greater than the sum of its parts - FISH is, after all, an acquired taste as a vocalist, and the musicianship is not outstanding. However, MARILLION are not afraid to allow their simple, direct approach to create a soundtrack to FISH'S journey of self-discovery chronicled here.And it is this journey that lifts the album above all other 'neo-progressive' efforts. The lyrics take us through themes of lost love, ruination and despair, both personal and that of wider society, but offer us a glimmer of hope at the journey's cathartic end. To my mind this sort of journey is an important function of progressive music often overlooked by listeners and reviewers alike.The '70s influences on this record are clearly discernible, and for this MARILLION seem to attract criticism. However, this is clearly a 1980s record, with superior production values and sensibilities. MARILLION forged their own path, and it is insulting to allocate them something other than a genuine place in the history of progressive music."

          "text": "This concept album is a seamless suite (every song segues into the next) of superb songs that ostensibly depict the troubled childhood of Marillion's larger-than-life lead singer Fish. Those looking for endless bits of outstanding instrumental prog are going to be disappointed, for Misplaced Childhood is very much a singer/songwriter's prog album rooted in the 80s. It also contains enough tragedy-laced beauty to attract anyone with an open mind.The wonderful synthy opener Pseudo Silk Kimino sets the tone for this album, with guitarist Steve Rothery and keyboardist Mark Kelly laying the groundwork for Fish's powerful vocals and arguably even more powerful lyrics. It soon breaks into Marillion's definitive pop song, the glorious Kayleigh, which conjures up all sorts of images of love among the ruins of the bitter Thatcherite UK experience. The almost-as-memorable Lavender (a penny for your thoughts, my dear!), which actually had to be extended for a single release, then follows.The five part Bitter Suite is a soundscape over which Fish initially recites a poem, before a Steve Rothery solo leads into an moving description of Fish's encounter with a French prostitute (which musically echoes Lavender). Parts IV and V (Misplaced Rendeszouz and Windswept Thumb respectively) are both achingly beautiful and brief. Heart Of Lothian is one of those pieces that makes comparisons with middle-era Genesis (or rather Peter Gabriel vocals with Mike Rutherford on guitar and Tony Banks on synth ... a combination that didn't really happen, I believe!) inevitable, yet there is a delightful flavour to this majestic song that is Marillion's alone.Waterhold (Expresso Bongo) is an ultra-busy piece in which underated drummer Ian Mosley gets to shine. It segues into the relatively forgettable Lords Of The Backstage (which has one of those stuttering offbeat rhythms prog bands are obliged to churn out from time to time), but there is nothing ordinary about the epic Blind Curve. Incorporating some delicate Steve Rothery acoustic guitar moments and atmospheric Mosley drumming, this album centerpiece is one of the more emotionally gripping tunes a progger is likely to encounter, although it's worth repeating that Marillion's strongest card is Fish, and not one of the instrumental players.The mood gets so intense that it almost needs a lighter pop-rock song like Childhood's End? to lift the dense fog of desperation that is likely to descend on anyone who listens to this album properly. Childhood's End? is one of those songs that may not sound that great on its own, but has its own visceral power and purpose within the context of this album. The closer White Feather is just that ... two minutes of instrumental neo-prog to wind down a lovely work of art.This pop-prog masterpiece is surely one of the finest releases of the 80s (in fact it is Marillion's own Script For A Jester's Tear that tops it!). It should be said though that while I think Marillion was a dominant player among its contemporaries, I don't rate these guys among my top 50 prog bands. Also there's the fact that I was 12 when this album came out and that may have prompted a sentimental attachment that elevates Marillion's worth to beyond what a new listener may perceive when he or she first hears this band/album. Whatever the mitigating factors might be, I love this album. ... 71% on the MPV scale"

The tour was a massive garden party for Marillion freaks and progheads in a sheer euphoric state of mind. More than twenty years later I look back at this album a bit more objective. In fact it's a 50% good and 50% disappointing record, the balance between the musicians chemistry is disturbed. In my opinion this is caused by the too dominant role from Fish, his lyrics are drenched with the impact of his drinking habits and self-destructive behavior. \"What a waste\" once Fish sung ...."

A loose concept album (are Fish's lyrics autobiographical?), it includes the excellent singles Lavender and Kayleigh. So what if they were commercial, they were fine songs; their only crime is that they offend the \"musn't sell well or it's pop\" brigade, hence some totally unjustified low ratings. This album is pure prog with fine musicianship and solid songs. The keyboard and guitar work is as strong as ever and the fine bass lines underpin the melodies, which blend seamlessly into one another. Standout tracks are Heart of Midlothian, Childhood End and White Feather but overall the material is consistent if not quite up to the standard of the first two albums. But at least they were now developing their own style rather than relying on Genesis for inspiration and that can only be good. Well worth buying."

          "text": "An encounter with the haunting keyboard sound at the overture of \"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" was part of my bedtime each night sometimes in 1985. It was almost like a ritual: the day was done, time to go to bed, so my friend dimmed the lights in his room, put the cassette version of this album into the tray of his compo stereo set and... that was it. I had to get through all of them because I stayed at his place for several weeks. I never look back to it with regret as it was my first fruitful introduction to Marillion, a great band to whom I've been its fan since then.To tell the truth, the keyboard sound was the magic from which I was drawn deeply into a distinctly flavored 1970s-style progressive rock opus. Then also the lyric that followed: Huddled in the safety of pseudo silk kimono/ wearing bracelets of smoke, naked of understanding...I was so amazed by the beautiful sound came out from the speakers. The music flowed seamlessly, and expressively moving. Catchy melodies -- and eloquently guitar playing that reminded me of Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett -- spread across almost every songs, telling a personal story about childhood experiences and self-confessed of rock star-type indulgences.When I finally bought my own copy shortly afterward, also a cassette version, and had time to listen to it myself, I grew completely sure I wasn't wrong with my first impression. And I am not make any mistake indeed as I always find new experiences and nuances each time I listen to it. Even nowadays, when I already got the CD version from a sale at a record store in Singapore.This album is a masterpiece."

And this is the best Neo-Progressive album from the 80's that I've heard...Every song of this third Marillion's release is great, with a pop feeling that make this album a bit commercial, but it isn't bad in my opinion. Kayleigh, Lavender, Childhood's End?, White Feather... are songs very enjoyable by any kind of people, while others like Bitter Suite and Blind Curve are wonderful pieces for prog-lovers. The job by the musicians (except the awful Ian Mosley) is wonderful, specially the Steve Rothery's guitars, and the Fish's lyrics are marvellous, while he sings very much better than the two previous albums. He made a great and very personal work here, and it's hard for me to say that, because I clearly prefer Marillion with Steve Hogarth...Recommended for people who want to hear the best progressive made in the 80's."

          "text": "After the stellar brilliant debut Script for a Jester's Tear and the sophomore slump of Fugazi, Marillion returned to the studio and created their first concept album. Vocalist/lyricist Fish draws from personal experience and weaves his words with images that simply stun the listener. Musically, the entire group supplies top notch performances. Rothery shines with his David Gilmour-esque guitar solos and his Alex Lifeson-esque riffs. Pete Trewavas supplys thumping and powerful bass while keeping in perfect rhythm with Ian Mosely, who supplys top notch beats and keeps the rhythm while the rest of the band goes off on and creates colorful sounds. Mark Kelly is the real musical hero of this album, creating many moods and textures with his caravan of synths. But the true star of this album is Fish, who captivates and articulates his emotions with beautiful words and emotional vocals.From the opening synths of Pseudo Silk Kimono to the fade out chorus of White Feather, the listener is taken on a journey that tackles love, loss, despair, and triumph. The highlight tracks are Bitter Suite, which is a suite tackled within a 5 minute mainframe, Heart of Lothian, with a thumping chorus that is catchy and mesmerizing, Blind Curve, which features a stunning Rothery guitar breakdown, and the resiliant Childhood's End, which features a standout performance from Pete Trewavas. All of these songs feature brilliant choruses, stellar riffs, and mesmerizing vocals.Overall, this is one of the jewels of the Marillion crown, no fan of the group should go without it. Neo-Prog doesn't get much better than this. Arguably one of the best in it's genre, Misplaced Childhood is a masterpiece of progressive music that no one should go without listening at least once. 5/5."

I've tried to get into it countless times, but now I've just got to admit that it bores me to tears. OK, it's well played and Fish's lyrics are as usually quite interesting - but to me it will never rank as high as other prog masterpieces. While Marillion's first album was without any doubt one of the best things to come out of the '80s (in spite of the strong Genesis influences which somewhat undermined its originality), their third is really nothing special at all. Two catchy pop songs (\"Kayleigh\" is not bad, but not very progressive either), and then a ton of lead. I found it such heavy going that I can hardly remember the titles of the songs, with the exception of the above-mentioned two hits.After this album I practically stopped listening to Marillion, though I've been planning to catch up with their Hogarth-era production. I'm really sorry to destroy what to many people is a myth, but this pompous, pretentious, uninspiring album was really a big disappointment."

          "text": "Misplaced Childhood was supposed to be the album that flew in the face of everything that the record company (EMI) wanted Marillion to be (a more predictable and boring pop band was what they were after) by being one big song. In the end we got an album that is effectively 2 pieces of continuous music and the record company got the hit single and fast selling album, so every body was happy.The album starts with the very spooky Pseudo Silk Kimono witch effectively maps out the album's theme for you in just 2 minutes. However once their done sending shivers down your spine they segue into what is probably progs most poppy song that is still undeniably prog, Kayleigh. It was also the song that made them stars to the general public but more importantly it showed that this was not going to retrace the steps of either Script for a Jesters Tear or Fugazi.Indeed, the album is punctuated by short, clever blasts such as Lavender, witch continues the story after Kayleigh, around the 2 centre pieces, Bitter Suite and Blind Curve. Its these 2 songs that really make Misplaced Childhood as good as it is. Bitter Suite continues the theme of lost love and dreams wonderfully, whilst Blind Curve shows the pitfalls and trappings that can bring one down in the pursuit of that dream as you get closer to attaining it.The album finishes off by first accepting all that has come before it and then giving the most feel good ending to a song since Genesis' Suppers ready (yes I know its another Genesis reference but this ones deserved).Musically all members are firing on all cylinders in this album but overall it does lack that final spark that was so evident on Script for a Jesters Tear and Fugazi. Perhaps Fish getting over his paranoia and insecurities was good for him but he did write some amazing songs with them and that last edge went with them.Overall this is better than Fugazi but just lacks that last bit of magic to beat Script for a Jester Tear. It's still a masterpiece though and should not be turned down for anything."

That almost never happens, but a couple times over the years it has, and the feeling that fills over your mind and washes over your soul is more powerful then the most potent drug that money can buy. It validates everything you have worked for, every pain you\u2019ve gone through to get to that point. It\u2019s the working man\u2019s equivalent of a professional orgasm.The perfect album is like that too. It\u2019s like hot, wet dirty raw animal sex, only without the cigarette afterwards. Seriously. Almost never happens, but we keep buying them and playing them and reading about them and hoping that just every so often, even just once, we will lay that vinyl on the rubber mat or slide the disc into the tray or close the lid of the tape player \u2013 and our world will change forever. If you\u2019ve ever felt that, you know exactly what I mean. If you haven\u2019t, oh man \u2013 you have one intense, soul-freeing moment ahead of you when it finally happens. If you\u2019re not sure, then it hasn\u2019t happened \u2013 once you have ever felt that, then there is no doubt.So yes \u2013 this is one of those albums for me, no doubt about it. I still have the original vinyl release that I bought in the summer of 1985, and I still play it. With a wife and kids and cats and a job and responsibilities and distractions it doesn\u2019t happen all that often any more. But every once and a while the kids are busy being kids, the wife is shopping, and the cats are chasing mice or whatever it is that cats do. And sometimes, on those rare occasions, I lay out the vinyl and drop the needle - and I just disappear. Magic!This album came out during what was supposed to be the summer after my final year of college. I hadn\u2019t graduated though \u2013 not enough money to take classes, not enough hope or energy to keep trying. I had a girlfriend at the time too; well, to be more precise, I had an infatuation at the time, and I used to meet her in the student lobby every day and bring her a single white rose, then just sit and look at her in the afternoon shade while she read her books. I\u2019m not sure she completely realized I existed, let alone that I was hopelessly smitten with the idea of being in love with her. We hung out some and I imagined that it was more than it was, but one day while driving home from dinner she informed me that she was a lesbian and was moving away to be with another woman. Well, it\u2019s not like I hadn\u2019t heard that excuse before, but it turns out that this time, with this girl, it was actually true. Open chest, shred heart. Lost my job too, something about not wanting people around who smoked too much pot and weren\u2019t very reliable, blah blah \u2013 not really sure of the details, I wasn\u2019t actually listening at the time. So I wandered down to the mall and joined the Marine Corps, basically just to reaffirm my manhood and all. Seems kind of drastic now in retrospect. There\u2019s a point to this story if you\u2019ll bear with me.Anyway, at the mall I also shelled out ten bucks that I couldn\u2019t afford for this album. Great cover, really clean, sharp airbrush of some kid in a military-school getup holding a parrot, or bluebird, or magpie \u2013 whatever. I knew who these guys were, since I had had a similar pivotal moment a couple years prior while listening to \u2018Script for a Jester\u2019s Tear\u2019. So I pretty much expected to be lifted up and blown away. High hopes \u2013 can\u2019t blame a guy for thinking positive.Well, blown away I was. Repeatedly. Totally. Hopelessly.It\u2019s possible that considering my state of mind and of my personal affairs and of the fact that I had apparently just signed myself up to be shipped off sans hair and trained to kill people I didn\u2019t even know, well \u2013 in that specific state of mind, it wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if a Wham! album or a cloudy day or a stain on my shirt would have blown me away. Seriously though, any of those things just might have, but certainly wouldn\u2019t have had the same staying power this turned out to have. And anyway, I eventually crawled out of that fetid hovel of a sh!thole I had dug for myself and managed to piece together a pretty decent life (remember, the wife and kids and cats and fulfilling career \u2013 that whole thing).But still, twenty years later and worlds away from that life, I still find my way into that place that Fish and company introduced me to in that other place and time, and it still leaves me breathless.The very first strains of Mark Kelly\u2019s eerie and seductive keyboards mark the signal for the beginning of this now-familiar journey. Fish has said in later interviews that the album concept was inspired by a day-long acid trip, and the supernatural tones and his whispered murmurs evoke that feeling just moments into the listen. Memories of darker days come screaming back into my consciousness like a demon across a dark room as Fish morbidly echoes wretched emotions and base hopeless regret amid the funeral procession of sound of \u201cPseudo Silk Kimono\u201d:\u201cNicotine smears, long, long dried tears, invisible tears; safe in my own words, learning from my own words \u2013Cruel joke, cruel joke\u201dand then viciously skewers my raw wounds while stepping seamlessly into a pitiable reminiscence of love gone sour with \u201cKayleigh\u201d. Steve Rothery could have convinced me to shave my head and sell trinkets in airports had he been inclined to after hearing the supernatural sounds that emanated from his guitar strings on this song. Maybe this became a hit and earned contempt among the musical snobbery, but to me he was providing an exquisite backdrop to the story of the love I never actually had, but that I had managed to lose anyway:\u201cDo you remember barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars; do you remember loving on the floor in Belsize Park. Do you remember dancing in stilettos in the snow\u2026\u201dwell, I didn\u2019t remember any of those things, since none of them had actually happened. But it could have been, right? This could be my story, couldn\u2019t it? Much more poignant than the reality, for sure. Doesn\u2019t matter anyway, since this world in my mind is where I am at the moment, and those things happened in here.Still we are traveling back in time together \u2013 Fish, Marillion, my thoughts and me, and the next scene is a bit closer to my reality of those childhood days before all this sh!t went so horribly wrong, when children\u2019s songs and prancing through the park and gazing at rainbows still held my imagination, and when a warm breeze and a fleeting laugh was enough to cap a beautiful and memorable day; when \u201cLavender\u201d was the color of the flowers and of the ribbons and of the dress of the little girl who was sharing this childhood moment in the park with me:\u201cLavender\u2019s blue, dilly dilly, lavender\u2019s green; when I am King, dilly dilly, you will be Queen.A penny for your thoughts my dear, a penny for your thoughts my dear; I.O.U. for your love, I.O.U. for your love\u201d.But this childhood dream, like the childhood is represents, is chased away by the growing shadows of time, and I wake to find myself back in the now. A dank, dark street fills my view, all strewn with trash and filth and broken dreams; and inhabited by others of the walking wounded who are also seeking a moment, or even just a touch, or just a diversion to distract the reality of what is, and the terrible weight of what cannot be undone. We have arrived at the crossing to the quagmire, the \u201cBitter Suite\u201d:\u201cIt's getting late, for scribbling and scratching on the paper; something's gonna give under this pressure. And the cracks are already beginning to show \u2013It's too late\u201d.This is too much reality now \u2013 its time for another flashback to somewhere else. The next offering from my muse, the boys in the band, comes in the form of the celebration and angst that fills the \u201cHeart of Lothian\u201d:\u201c'Cos you look like an actor in a movie shot; but you're feeling like a wino in a parking lot - how did I get in here anyway?Do we really need a playback of the show?\u201dNow, it doesn\u2019t make a bit of difference to me that I have never even been to England, or Scotland, or wherever the hell \u2018Lothian\u2019 is. To me, it is a place where everything is okay, and the people in the crowd raise their glasses and call my name, the mood is light and the music is sweet, and the darkness envelopes but cannot consume. I have my member\u2019s pass, and I belong here.And then a slightly insane Scotsman issues forth a call that pierces the night and turns like a spirit into the rallying cry of the damned:\u201cI was bor-ororororororororororororororororrororn, with the heart of Lothian!\u201dF**kin\u2019-A right!!What were we talking about?My new friends and I down another round and shout our rallying cries in the \u201cWaterhole\u201d. The night passes, the streets are empty, the band plays on \u2013 and we down another round.Of course, with the battery on my psyche and the world\u2019s weight continuing to beat me down and the drinks clouding my mind that wasn\u2019t too clear to begin with, that demon of distress and dire dread begins to consume my brain, and once again I regret:\u201ca lifestyle with no simplicities; but I'm not asking for your sympathy.Talk, we never could talk, distanced by all that was between us. A lord of the backstage, a creature of language \u2013I'm so far out and I'm too far in\u201d.I stagger from the pub and into the waiting black sedan, and as we pull away from the curb the landscape begins to change. Now the focus is not on me. Now I\u2019m on the outside, and looking in. Now this other wretched soul who\u2019s been tracking my shadow as I wander the streets in search of the light, he is speaking now \u2013 and the venom flies out of his mouth. We careen around a blind curve, out of control and flying wildly into the night. I grab for a handhold, and refill our glasses while he spews forth more hate, more disgust, more of his melodic dirge. And I am captivated by the sound. His eyes pierce me and open into a world of black abyss. Nothing moves in that chasm as we both black out.In the morning I drag my destitute self to the window, expecting once again to peer out on the cataclysm that is my world. But the rainbow has returned, and the magpie flies across my field of vision, and I know this is a sign. Something has changed. The despair of that reality can keep its grip on me no longer; the darkness cannot hide my destiny, I realize - can it?\u201cNow you realize that you've got to get out of here. You've found the leading light of destiny, burning in the ashes of your memory.You want to change the world, you'd resigned yourself to die a broken rebel.But that was looking backward - now you've found the light\u201d.Sure, why not? Slowly but with no pause I raise a white feather \u2013 it could be a white flag; and I surrender not to fate, but rather to destiny, and the difference is clear:\u201cThese are our hearts - you can't take away our hearts. You can't steal our hearts away;I can't walk away - no more\u201d.Okay, it\u2019s just an album, not a religion or anything. But here\u2019s my point \u2013 so what?!We listen to music for the same reason we look at art, for the same reason we crave the touch of another human spirit, for the same reason we choose to breathe and go on every day no matter what the pain or trials. Because the beauty and the intensity of the experience acknowledges and validates our pains, our longings, our passion; and that validation gives us hope.And that\u2019s enough.peace"

There are lots of story behind it (buying the CD) actually, firstly, a friend of mine, Gatot is his name, which is a member here : ) always talk about Marillion's Misplaced Childhood. Moreover, his picture on progarchives is this album's CD cover. This really makes me think that the album is reaaaaaaaly good, possibly too good. Another thing is that when I listened to a song from Misplaced Childhood on this site, Childhood. Ends ?. It was when I realized how great is this album (well, at that time, just a song actually) and also because its somewhat similar to Dream Theater's Take Away My Pain.Alright, back to the album. Based on my research, this album is Marillion's most successful album, very commercial if you would like to say that. It was released in 1985, but the one that I bought was the remastered edition, in 2002, but I'm pretty sure the songs have no different whatsoever. This album was also Marillion's first concept album, the story was about a lost love and childhood. Also, just like many other prog albums, the cover is really great, just like the one on progarchives, but there is another side, so its just a half of the cover. Now lets go through each song.Pseudo Silk Kimono - \"Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono wearing bracelets of smoke, naked of understanding.\", that is the first line of the song. The intro is really calming and peaceful with deep bass line. For me, this song is just the beginning of the long epic, the album itself which is considered as a long song.Kayleigh - Just a short story. When I listened this song for the first time, I didn't realize that this song is ultimately famous, until the \"do you remember.\" I felt so, I don't know, so strange, because my dad always play this song and sang loudly in the car. Well at that time, I wasn't into progrock, so I just closed my ears. Again, I researched about this song, and I know that Kayleigh, well, it was Kay Lee actually, whose dated with Fish. Also, if you look at the lyrics, the song is more about love breaking. The song starts off with the same style from Pseudo Silk Kimono, but this time, its more \"groovy\" with nice bass guitar and drum combination. The composition is just like a typical song, verse, chorus then verse followed by another chorus.Lavender - Ahh, I really love this song but its hard to choose which one is my favorite, simply because all the songs, without exception, are extremely great. \"I was walking in the park dreaming of a spark.\" with a calm piano sound and cool drum line. When it hits the chorus, the mood increases but somewhat the song still, like, calms the heart (well, calms my heart). Also, the guitar solo is quite simple, yet profound, really suits the song.Bitter Suite - Sorry about this, but somehow I like to relate certain songs to Dream Theater songs : ) This one is really like Dream Theater's Trial Of Tears with cool drum lines and nice ambience at the beginning of the song. The song itself was divided into five. The first part is just a non-melodic vocal, if you know what I mean, that Fish was like just read the lyrics. The best part for me is Blue Angle, where the piano and guitar lines really great along with cool bass and drum and I reckon is the most melodic and touching part of the song. \"I can hear your heart, hear your heart.\", really great that I feel like in my own heaven. This part ends with a melody like the one in Dream Theater's Octavarium (sorry again!!).Heart Of Lothian - The intro is just amazing, really great yet very progressive. You can tell from the drum beat and guitar melody along \"wide boys, wide boys, wide boys, born with hearts of Lothian.\" The next verse was played along with nice guitar melody and deep drum lines. The climax of the song, for me is at the end of the first part, Wide Boy, \"I was born with the heart of Lothian.\". While the second part is somewhat very calm and quite with a nice ambience from the keyboardWaterhole - The song is very dynamic and very rockish. One thing is that, the second verse or maybe you consider this as the chorus, really surprised me, \". when you think its time to go, don't be surprised, .\" they way that he sang that line is just very \"progressive\". The last 4 second of the song, the guitar melody and beat changes, possibly for the intro of the next song.Lords Of Backstage - This is also a song that Om Gatot (well I called him like that) always talk about, its the \"I just want you to be the first one.\" part. The song is somewhat very short and is the introduction of the next song. The duration of the song is just nearly two minutes.Blind Curve - ARHH!! This album really means everything to me, since probably this is the most beautiful album I've had so far (well, one of the most beautiful). Right now, I'm listening to the album and this song really is the, uh, I don't know, its like the point of all. The intro is just amazing, cool but has very deep feeling. At the second minute, the which is the third part, the song composition is just great, very amazing, again, simple yet profound with very good vocal style. \"So I talked about conscience and I talked about pain, and he looked out the window and it started to rain.\", simply amazing. Again, I want to compare this to Octavarium, that the fourth part, is somewhat like Octavarium's fourth part (I just realized that it's the same part!!). The vocal style is like reading a poem, without any melodic with dark and deep drum line. Slowly, the energy increases, \". the childhood, the childhood, the childhood, oh please give it back to me.\" then the music \"breaks\" and the mood really goes up, AMAZING!! The last part is just as amazing as the other parts, really beautiful. The last guitar solo is very great, simple but great, very touching and followed by the next song.Childhoods End ? - Yet, my favorite (well its not my \"real favorite\", I just often play this song in the toilet every hour when I'm at school) song. The song starts off with cool muted guitar line and groovy drum and keyboard. The best part is the bass lines, which very jazzy groovy, well, very neo-progressive, that every I played this song using my IPod, I always push the earphone deep to my ears so I can hear the bass lines. There are two different guitar sound, distortion and nice \"funk\" clean style. Again,, when I compared to Dream Theater, this song is really similar to Take Away My Pain, and the guitar part is the main similarity.White Feather - A really great song to ends the album, really energetic and dynamic. In my opinion, the song should ends in with fixed ending, not faded out. However, I still couldn't find the relation between the story and this song since this song is more like some unity stuff.Well, in the end, what more can I say. This is my first Marillion's album, first neo- progressive, and someone introduced this album to me. But I never felt like this, I never enjoyed such an album although I just bought it few hours before I started to love the songs. Without any hesitation, five giant stars.Keep On Proggin' In The Free World!!!"

Playing better here than ever before, the band has composed a tremendous and sweeping album with many dynamic movements of varied tones and melody. As exceptional are Fish's poetic lyrics and storytelling ability, and whose voice is more beautiful here than on previous efforts (although he still sounds goofy during the really dramatic parts).The one-two punch of \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\" will always hold a spot in fan's hearts, but later songs are almost as good, with \"Heart of Lothian\" delivering an intensity not found since \"Script for a Jester's Tear\".All in all a perfect example of the '80's progressive sound and a perfect addition to any art lover's library.Songwriting: 5 Instrumental Performances: 4 Lyrics/Vocals: 4 Style/Emotion/Replay: 5"

          "text": "After the disappointing \"Fugazzi\" (even the band will admit this), Marillion is going to deliver a far much better album. A concept one. I think it is necessary to put things again into perspective here. Prog rock was a dying genre in these days.Just think about the crap that the giants were producing around this period : Yes, Genesis, Tull, Crimson etc. It is quite remarkable that a band was able to dinamize the genre again and be very popular on stage at the same time.This is another good reason to be thankful to Marillion and never forget their great value.This album was my first contact with the band, many, many years after its release (2001 to be precise). The first spins I gave to it were pleasant, but I was not submerged by admiration, I should say. I rediscovered it three years later when I entered in my Marillion-mania mostly born out of \"The script\". I bought a great deal of the Marillion discography, and I must say that \"Misplaced Childhood\" grew significantly in my scale of musical value then.I purchased their first eight albums in the double-CD format with lots of valuable bonus tracks for each of them. At that time, they were all very reasonably priced (around 13 ? or so). This album is no exception to the rule. The second CD will feature the whole of \"Misplaced\" as the band has recorded just before flying to Berlin at the famous Hansa studio (where Bowie recorded \"Heroes\"). It is very interesting to listen to earlier version of each track and find out how close to the final product they were although the track sequence was not yet finalized.The genesis (no play on words here) of the album came out the destructed mind of Fish. As he will outlined in the superb booklet that goes together with this double CD version. At this time of his career he was seriously addicted to alcohol.He will describe this period as such : \"I'd been paying the price. My big on / off relationship had finally bit the dust, left behind in a haze of exhaust fumes as I careered off in search of my elusive grail. I was off balance and quickly lost in a depraved wilderness in which I soon made a home.The touring lifestyle fed my addictions on every level and when the bus dropped me off at my newly acquired house in Albert Street, Aylebury I found myself very alone and dislocated from all the distractions that had fed my desire to escape commitments, responsibilities and realities. I was faced with long periods of quite empty days and very dark nights\".Then, Fish will enter his acid trip which he described as such : \"An enveloppe arrived. Inside there was a short letter from an old girlfriend with the recommendations to digest the accompanying contents - a tab of very strong acid\". He will only swallow half of it but due to euphoria, he will get the second one a few hours later. Then he will get on his bike and head for Steve's house...Steve had to drive him back and lock him. Fish will describe that night as a : \"long white-knuckle roller-coaster of a night\".It was in this state of \"mind\" that Fish will : \"scribble my lyrics in my lyric book on the off chance of catching something from the trip\". And \"Misplaced\" was born.Marillion took it on tour in the late 1984 (the first half of it). As Fish will humoristically mention (and he has a great sense of humour) on a boot recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on December 14, 1984 : \"We are now going to play a part of the album that will come up in May/June of next year. It is made of two tracks called : side one and side two ! At that time, their record company, although pleased with the development of \"Misplaced\" was rather nervous to release a concept album with no singles to be aired. In 1985, it was not really common. But the band knew that two singles would come out : \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavander\".So, this was the hectic genesis of \"Misplaced\". Apparently, the recording sessions were on par. Steve tells us : \"We had a lot of fun in the three months we worked in Berlin but I think we all probably aged at least three years during our time there\" !Pete adds : \"It was also the very first time that we had money to spend and the time to spend it\" !But, again, Fish describes these sessions with lots of details: \"To give you a tantalising taste of the debauchery, I could mention the bedside phone book at the hotel with lists of escort agencies dealing in home delivery of beautiful women who took care of most of my weekly wages and left me resorting to banging on band members'doors at 4 AM looking for loans\" !A few others epic moments such as : \"stripping off naked in a restaurant for a bet, having a bottle of Jack Daniel's with the band name on it in my favourite brothel, throwing bricks over the Wall trying to set land mines off, deliberately taking out EMI executives with huge quantities of alcohol and sleeping through playbacks so they'd give us good reports when back home, my first and last heroin experience etc. etc.\".Sex and drugs and rock'n'roll, are very good indeed...(Ian Dury, RIP). Although the other members are less explicit about their own behaviour, these three months must have been quite a fun...Although this album is a very good one, I can hardly rank it at the level of a masterpiece. Actually, I have rated very few to this level (TIAB being one exception). This album is really Fish's one. He will play it in its entirety for the twenty years anniversary of its release. I attended one of his concert in April 2006 and I must say that it was a very emotional moment. To hear this excellent work as well as to see Fish on stage. He is a great entertainer and a born showman. It is amazing to hear such a voice coming out such a strong body.There will be some very good moments but too few of a powerful caliber like one could hear in \"The Script\". Very poppish and melodious singles of course with \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\". I quite like the intro as well as \"Childhoods End\". There is also a wink at another great concept album during the very end of \"Bitter Suite\". One can hear Fish singing \"Reing On Me\" which can be heard on \"Love, Reign On Me\" from Quadrophenia (The Who).The double CD version is of great added value, and you should not hesitate to get it if still available at a reasonable price. Four stars."

I don't know, but it's that element of the music that pushes it up to a five star record for me.\"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" is a short song with fragile vocals and synths that create a melancholic mood. \"Kayleigh\" reached number two on the UK charts and is a song about one of FISH's ex girlfriends. I have read comments from several young women who were named Kaykeigh after this song. \"Do you remember...\" I love these lines and this song. Rothery treats us to a tasteful guitar solo as well. \"Lavender\" features some beautiful piano melodies in this uplifting song that ends with a great guitar solo. \"Bitter Suite\" has many mood shifts and the intro is very atmospheric with some great drumming. A monologue comes in followed by some reserved yet at the same time theatrical vocals. I like the guitar melody that comes in.The piano/vocal melody brings GENESIS to mind later in the song.\"Heart Of Lothian\" is more uptempo with some uplifting guitar that soars. \"Waterhole (expresso bongo)\" has some more fantastic guitar from Rothery as well as some good synth work from Kelly. The bongos are a nice touch. \"Lords Of The Backstage\" features some outstanding vocals and drumming. \"Blind Curve\" is perhaps my favourite.The Gilmour like guitar is impressive 2 minutes in. Fish's vocals are amazing ! This song is atmospheric and emotional for me. What an exhilarating ending with dramatic vocals and soaring guitar. \"Childhood's End ?\" is a song that makes me feel so good. I love the way it ends. \"White Feather\" is a positive and upbeat tune, and is lyrically a perfect way to end this record.I think this is MARILLION's best album."

Playing better here than ever before, the band has composed a tremendous and sweeping album with many dynamic movements of varied tones and melody.The music is magic and Steve Rothery's guitar is full of emotion and Mark Kelly\ufffds work in keyboards is superb accompanied by the rich, genius poetic lyrics of Fish. The whole album is beyond simple music, all tracks are divine, so i can't choose one track to be the best, all are super and smooth. Overall, this is one of the jewels of prog music, no one should go without it. Neo- Prog doesn't get much better than this. Arguably one of the best in it's genre, Misplaced Childhood is a masterpiece of progressive music that no one should go without listening at least once. 5 stars, a must for everyone."

Stop telling me you don\u2019t care for popularity \u2013 every Prog band has a wet dream of becoming a bit more popular, a BIT more, I\u2019m telling you!I won\u2019t even dare to describe songs or tell anything about the story Fish is telling. If you still didn\u2019t listen to this album, it is really a shame. There are albums, that are Musts for every Prog-fan, and MARILLION\u2019s \u201cMisplaced Childhood\u201d stands in Top-20 for sure as the best Neo-Prog concept album ever written. Turn your head off, please. Let the music speak. Yes, \u201cWaterhole\u201d and \u201cLords\u2026\u201d are a bit lame and they\u2019d better throw \u201cFreaks\u201d instead of these two. Yes, \u201cKayleigh\u201d is a pure pop song. Yes, all songs are rather short. SO WHAT??? Turn your heart on, buddy, and listen to the album precisely. Just check out how Rothery plays \u201cHeart of Lothian\u201d and \u201cLavender\u201d solos \u2013 so mellow, so sincere, so touching! Get the videos from that era \u2013 aren\u2019t they wonderful despite their amateur attitude? Listen to Fish\u2019s climax in \u201cBlind Curve\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t you feel yourself filled with anger too? F&%#ing politicians, they think they know how to change the world! And these songs of social anger are still actual, and this is sad.I know people, who hate Prog but adore this album. It has something unique, something that wasn\u2019t present even on the perfect \u201cScript\u2026\u201d and on a cold and biting \u201cFugazi\u201d records. I simply cannot believe someone hates this album or calculates the number of complex signatures used or something. Turn you head off, folks, I insist. Be proud to own your heart. Thank you, Fish and guys, for my NON-misplaced childhood. I love your stuff :)"

Maybe I'm just a goofball, but it doesn't come close to their debut Script for a Jester's Tear and I don't even find it to be at a level of quality similar to Fugazi. For me, Misplaced Childhood doesn't develop into anything interesting musically as it chiefly seems to focus more on lyrics than composition. Also, the concept doesn't seem to really interest me and often seems vague and wandering. I find that the production seems more flat than on previous albums and it is quite obvious that the songs are more commercial sounding (in fact Kayleigh and Lavender did very well on the singles charts in the U.K.).Even though I don't think this album is as good as previous albums, it's still a good and mostly enjoyable listen. For me, it's the entire \"side two\" set of songs (tracks 6-10) that I enjoy the most. On side 1, I like Lavender the best, which sort of reminds me of the type of song Fish would perform on his future solo albums (Kayleigh is also a precursor of Fish's solo style). Not a bad album, but far from a masterpiece to my ears. Good, but not essential. Three stars."

          "text": "Many of the characteristics of classic albums can be found in Misplaced Childhood, including some very catchy melodies, recurring themes, solid transitions between songs, and a somewhat unifying concept. On the other hand, this album also has many of the notable flaws that plague so many 80s albums, from cheesy synths, overly simplistic songs and rhythms, and very little interesting musical (to say nothing of virtuosic) contributions from the individual musicians. If Fish was \"safe in the sunshine\", so is Marillion with this album, taking few risks and in so doing making few notable contributions. I understand that Marillion made a positive historical contribution to prog with their debut, but Misplaced Childhood represents some regression in my opinion.Pseudo Silk Kimono, Kayleigh. This is not a great start, from the simplistic synth opener (painfully magnifying Fish's vocal limitations), to the catchy yet poppy Kayleigh (at least this one has a nice guitar break and Fish sounds much better).Lavender, Bitter Suite, Waterhole, Lords of the Backstage. In a word, boring. The first two have many slow parts, failing to develop quickly enough to hold my interest, and the latter two are too short to really make an impact. After enough time, I usually just blow past these tunes.Heart of Lothian, Blind Curve. Here the music really picks up. Heart of Lothian is a great song, don't get me wrong, but Genesis comparisons are hugely overstated. It starts out in 7/4 time, then moves to 5/4, with great guitar and synth interplay for a killer intro, but then settles into a simple 4/4 groove for the rest of the song. So there's the one minute of really inspired prog on this album for me. Blind Curve is the extended piece (nearly 10 minutes) and sounds like the closest song resembling Script for a Jester's Tear on the album. If the album was dragging for you to this point (as it was for me), here is where things really pick up in emotion and quality, leading to a great finale.Childhood's End?, White Feather. These are basically two well-transitioned songs that make for an EXCELLENT close to the album. Great powerful (yet melodic) singning by Fish, coupled with some great melodies and tasteful synth playing, really ends this album on a high note.In sum, I like the second half much more than the first, though there is nothing awful or truly spectacular throughout. I see this as one of many solid, yet flawed albums, and three stars seems appropriate."

          "text": "Wow! What an album! This was Marillion's third album and one of the best they have ever produced. It also seems to be a favorite among fans of the Fish-era Marillion. This album is proof that not all the classic prog albums were made in just the 70s. Here we have Marillion who in my opinion, might be the best band the 80s has seen.The great thing about this album is does it not only have great musical structure, but a great story to go along with it. A lot of people may be able to relate to it, Fish's story about childhood girlfriends, breakups, etc. Yes I know it sounds like it'd probably be boring and cliche, but trust me it's not. It's quite an imaginative story and really engages the listener.Now if you're not familiar with Marillion, I definately recommend this album to start with. However, modern rock fans might be more into the Hogarth-era Marillion. This is definately a prog classic, however it also extremely appealing to fans of standard rock and pop music (my mother is complimenting it right now as I listen to it). The songs are very catchy with a clear 80s sound. Lots of synth textures, grandiose guitar solos, etc. It makes a beautiful and unique sound that only Marillion seems to have perfected over the countless imitators.There are not really any standout tracks here, as the album is meant to be listened to as a whole. They trick the listener very well as the songs transition seamlessly from one to another. I didn't even realize I was on the 5th track right now! So those looking for a movie-like experience will find it in this album. Those looking for a collection of hits may be disappointed.Now this album is heavily influenced by Peter Gabriel era Genesis. Fish's vocals are very reminiscent of Gabriel's, but a little deeper. Don't fear that they are Genesis clones though. They are influenced but create a unique sound of their own that evolved into the neo-prog genre. Overall, I think this album is very successful and a fantastic piece of work. Especially considering the amount of trash that was put out during the 80s. Highly recommended!"

          "text": "Back in the eighties when there was a lack of interesting progbands (unlike nowadays !) you were pleased very easily and this was the case when I found out about this album by Marillion. I thought it was a sensation, there was not going to be any better around for a long time. If I would have reviewed it back then I would have given it 5 stars, no doubt. But we are almost a quarter of a century further in time (how it flies !), many many progalbums have come along that are equal or even (far) better than Misplaced Childhood and so I will not go as far as 5 stars, despite the sentimental value which is of course there ! I don't like the 3 opening songs of this album by the way, they are too commercial to me. On the other hand, it is a fact that if there was no song like Kayleigh, that was in the hitparade in Holland and is still in the top 100 of all times here in the Netherlands, many people wouldn't know Marillion and there would be no good example to give to \"ignorant\" people what prog music is.So the album to me really starts with Bitter Suite, that's really progressive, somewhat gloomy, very interesting track. It's followed by The Heart of Lothian, a sort of native track emotionally sung by Fish, also a little bit commercial. Then we are treated with very progressive passages with Blind Curve and some shorter tracks, these are the tracks I was in love with in the eighties, the reason why I loved this album and of course still do in a way. But it's only half of the album I am really enthusiastic about so I have to remain objective and give it 4 stars"

          "text": "If someone would tell you that an entirely concept album - among the best in history - was written during a 10-hour acid trip,you would say he was insane.But that is the truth behind ''Misplaced Childhood''.The same year ''Fugazi'' was released,Marillion recorded the excellent ''Real to reel'' live album,the band toured constantly to the point Fish and crew were exhausted.An envelop with acid sent by a friend to Fish was the beginning of ''Misplaced childhood'',a trip through life with strong autobiographical elements.The rest of the band accepted Fish'es concept idea and the album started slowly to took shape.However EMI was not on call to repeat the high budget and long recording process as with ''Fugazi''.Marillion found themsleves at Hansa Studios in West Berlin, Germany,where producer Chris Kimsey was responsible of keeping the band tight to release the album.The album was finally released in mid-1985.The album contains track by track thematic elements around love,dissapointment, lost childhood years, immerse success and pride,all were actually characteristics of Fish himself and his life so far,with lyrics in an enigmatic way,showcasing Fish was not exactly in the right state of mind.The beautiful artwork was a work by airbrush artist Mark Wilkinson,while the boy on the front sleeve was actually a neighbour of Wilkinson,named Robert Mead,who became a trademark of the band like jester,being part of various singles of the band.The concept opens with ''Pseudo Silk Kimono''.Mark Kelly introduces the concept with magnificent soaring atmosphering synths,surrounded by Rothery's background crying guitar and Fish'es storytelling voice.Here Fish sings about the story of his acid trip.The opening track will give birth to ''Kayleigh'',maybe the most recognizable Marillion tune around the world.The title refers to Fish'es lost and gone love for her past girlfriend Kay (middle name: Lee),who's name he misspelled.The most accesible track of the album with again nice lyrics and beautiful soloing by Rothery.''Kayleigh'' is connected with the following dreamy ''Lavender'',led by the sensational piano of Mark Kelly and the hoping voice of Fish and based on the lyrics of a traditional song,at least 300-350 years old.There is a sign of optimism in this one,giving hope to a sudden love on a dreamy walk.''Bitter suite'' is split into a five-part 10-min. suite,dealing again with one of Fish'es lost loves,Magdalena.The atmosphere this band could create sets on top with grandiose guitar playing,synth layers around and Fish'es voice slightly distorted to end up with a sensational pastoral outro.''Heart of Lothian'' is one of the most emotional Marillion songs ever,despite his full energy.It refers to the pride of the Scottish people for their ground and the youth of Fish himself,when he was hanging out all the time.The track contains fantastic Rothery soloing,Fish on the top of his form,a superb break in the middle and a pounding rhythm section,thus giving the composition a sense of a real pride.The tightly connected ''Waterhole'' and ''Lords of the Backstage'' refer again to the combination of lost love and life on the road with upbeat tempos,obscure keyboard work by Kelly,pounding drumming by Mosley and the theatrical singing of Fish being a highlight.Another five-part suite ''Blind's curce'' will follow with plenty of themes around love,losing a friend and childhood nostalgia.Fish'es lyrics are perfectly mirrored in Marillion's music.The atmosphere remains full keyboard-oriented,grandiose and bombastic with a psychedelic middle-part and featuring some of the best guitar soli in the history of progressive rock.Please try to deal with the lyrics here and the experience will be more than memorable.Then comes the sign of hope back.Fish realizes that even he's grown up,the child is still there,deep inside him.''Childhood's end?'' is a wake up message sent by Fish to all people,wrapped under his ethereal singing,the energetic chorus and the full performance of the band with extremely dynamic guitars and backing synths.The album will close with ''White Feather''.With a groovy tune and a powerful no-surrender polyphonic singing,the band sents a message of optimism,joy and inner strength to all children of the world.The album became fairly a huge selling success in the UK.It combines the energetic,often complicated and highly atmospheric musicianship with some of the most esoteric lyrics ever written,indicating Fish was far beyong a simple lyricist.The combination of the two will give an unmet experience.The result?If I was alone in a desert island with an album and a player in hand,this work would propably have the most chances to be the one.A complete progressive rock milestone,extremely highly recommended."

          "text": "\"Misplaced Childhood\"is the 3rd full-length studio album by UK progressive rock actMarillion. The album was recorded between March 1985 and May 1985 and released throughEMI Recordsin June 1985. It\ufffds the successor to\"Fugazi\"from 1984.\"Misplaced Childhood\"proved to beMarillion\ufffdsmost commercially successful release, and they toured for a full year in support of the album.As\"Fugazi\" (1984)didn\ufffdt sell quite as well as\"Script for a Jester's Tear\" (1983), and cost double the money to record and promote (the video for\"Assassing\", had been exceptionally expense to film) compared to the budget of the debut album,Marillionwere under an intense pressure to deliver an album that would be more commercially satisfying toEMI Records. The label booked Hansa Studios in (West) Berlin (the same studio whereDavid Bowierecorded his Berlin album trilogy) and brought in producerChris Kimsey(Peter Frampton,The Cult,Emerson, Lake & Palmer...etc.), and they lived and worked in Berlin from March to May 1985.\"Misplaced Childhood\"is a concept release, dealing with subjects like love, relationships, lost childhood, and life-on-the-road. The atmosphere is often melancholic and the album is drenched in longing for the innocense of childhood. According to interviews with lead vocalistFishmost of the concept was conceived during an hours long acid trip, and maybe therefore the story is a bit fuzzy and not necessarily linear told. The lyrics are obviously very personal and strongly emotional andFishhas a strong voice and a paatos filled delivery, which have great impact on the listener. You can relate to the stories thatFishtells and feel the emotions when he sings about break-ups (\"Kayleigh\") and being a long way from home (in another country) in a hotel room, when told that someone close to you has died back home (\"Mylo\").Fishis a master of conjuring up vivid images of the topics in this lyrics.The album features two side-long suites, but it\ufffds individual tracks, which seque into each other, rather than two side long tracks. Except for\"Bitter Suite\"and\"Blind Curve\", which are both longer tracks (7-9 minutes in length), the tracks on\"Misplaced Childhood\"all feature more \"regular\" 2-4 minutes song lengths. Other than\"Kayleigh\"which was a big hit song, also among non-progressive rock audiences, the album is still very much a progressive rock album. The instrumentation, the theatrical/concept lyrics and vocal performances, and the dynamics of the music, all point in that direction. The instrumental part of the music may not be quite as challenging as on the two preceding album releases, but then againMarillionwere never the most complex or technically challenging progressive rock groups. They always favored atmosphere and melody over complex song structures and technical playing.\"Misplaced Childhood\"features a warm, detailed, and organic sounding production, which suits the material well. It\ufffds far from the thin and rather odd sounding production of\"Fugazi\" (1984)(which I personally appreciate, but understand why others don\ufffdt).Kimseydefinitely worked wonders here and\"Misplaced Childhood\"is an incredibly well sounding release. Upon conclusion\"Misplaced Childhood\"is the next logical step inMarillion\ufffdsdevelopment as a band, and it\ufffds also through and through a high quality release. A 5 star (100%) rating is deserved."

          "text": "After a slight stumble in ''Fugazi'', Marillion released MISPLACED CHILDHOOD, an album that has been considered by many to be the band's magnum opus. And I would have to agree with that opinion. While ''Script for a Jester's Tear'' summed up what Marillion was about, and proved that good prog had not died with the past greats, but was very much alive in these newer, fresher artists who were more than eager to introduce prog to a whole new generation.So, what makes MISPLACED CHILDHOOD so special? Well, for one thing, it does everything right that ''Jester'' did, but it also adds so much more life and appeal to the music. Where as the band's debut album was very grim in tone throughout (but no less a masterpiece, I assure you), this album is so much more lush and colourful by comparison. It also has a much clearer 'concept', with an almost narrative way of presenting the lyrics, which were no doubt chemically-induced, but no less poweful. Fish certainly hasn't been one to deny his exerimental side when it came to substances, but this album is certainly understandable even by sober listeners, which is great, too!MISPLACED is interestingly enough the second Marillion album I listened to, as in my ignorance I didn't realize there was an album between the two in release date terms Since ''Fuhazi'' is in my opinion a much weaker album then either of the other two, I am glad that this was my second Marillion adventure, and it is quickly becoming my favorite of theirs, which is saying something, because ''Script'' was such a fantastic album as well. Also something I think I should bring up is that this album as a whole, with the concepts and music and lyrics and artwork, is a record that could even give Pink Floyd's ''The Wall'' a run for it's money! And anyone who knows me at all is aware of how high a pedestal I hold THAT album on, so that should give you an idea of how great a record MISPLACED CHILDHOOD is.''Pseudo Silk Kimono'' is a good intro track, with beautiful melodies in it's own right, but not nearly as powerful as the songs to follow. I like to look at this song as a sort of appetizer before the main course. ''Safe in the sanctuary . . . safe.''What will come now is a narrative about a man's desire to revisit the innocence of childhood which he feels he has lost as he reflects on all of the negative effects his life has had on him. Great, great stuff, here when it comes to emotion, and Fish is no shy guy-- he tells it like it is.''Kayleigh'' I'm not sure if what I heard about Fish's invention of this name is true or not, but if so, it is very interesting. Wouldn't be too difficult to believe, since this song was a hit single for a time. Either way, the opening riff for this song reminds me very much of Pink Floyd. I think mainly because the notes Steve Rothery is hitting here are very similar to the notes found in the middle breakdown of the song ''Pigs (Three Different Ones)'' by off of Pink Floyd's ''Animals''. Anyway, that similarity soon leaves, however, and the riff changes into something much sweeter and more beautiful than anything Marillion has done up to this point in their career. Yet, it doesn't feel too sweet for comfort. Actually, it is possibly my favorite track on the album, just because it brings some of the warmest feelings to my heart a song ever could. Rothery is truly a genious guitarist.This song, not unlike every other song on MISPLACED, is very Fish-oriented, with vocals present for almost the entire time without relent. While I enjoy Fish's voice enough to not be bothered by this, I do realize that some may be put off by the lack of instrument-only bridge sections. But since this is a very Fish-driven concept, I don't think this is unjust. And since Marillion is indeed Neo-Prog, the constant vocal presence helps make the songs more appealing to more passive audiences. So while it may annoy some, most of us understand why the album is set up that way, and to me, this only adds beauty and depth to the record, since Fish's voice really is so amazing to listen to.''Lavender'' Is another phenominal song, but much like it's predecessor has enougb comercial pizazz to get stuck in your head the rest of the day (But in this case it is good because it is PROG, man!). It also features a very moving guitar solo by Rothery. Nothing fancy, but it just works!Oh yes, something else I should probably mention . . . this album also happens to be the best flowing album of all Marillion releases, with each track seamlessly flowing into the next, and while this segueing of tracks doesn't always work (Like anything else in art, it has to be done the right way in order to work well within the piece as a whole), it does work in this case. The first real 'concept' album by Marillion, MISPLACED CHILDHOOD does a fine job of making everything gel together flawlessly without much difficulty, or at least it seems to be the case.''Bitter Suite'' Kicks off alot darker and moodier than the previous three tracks, with some great ambient keys by Mark Kelly, and truly striking drumwork on Ian Mosley's part. I must admit, I wasn't all that impressed by him on ''Fugazi'', but he is truly gifted on his instrument, as this song demonstrates. Some truly psychedelic sounds are featured here, eliminating any symphonic prog links the band may have if not just during this one song. The song continues in this way until Fish does some spoken-word lyrics that are metaphoric, but still have a bit of humor in them to jazz things up a bit. I always get a bit of a giggle at his line about ''some obscure scottish poet''. Pete Trewavas also does some great bass playing here, preceeding another incredible Guitar solo from Steve Rothery. It stands on its own, then suddenly reprises the solo from ''Lavender''. This idea of everything coming back around is also a good sign of a well-constructed concept album, where the tracks are all actually part of something bigger. The poetry, ''She was paralyzed in the streetlight, she refused to give her name'' are just some of the many examples that prove Fish as being truly one of the greatest lyricists of all time. The melodies found in this song are very strong as well, and as a standalone track, it works beautifully, but also fits into the bigger picture nicely as well.Here, the band seems very emphatic on proving that they can indeed play music that is not merely a heavied-up Genesis (though I personally have never heard the connection between the two bands besides Fish's singing voice anyway)''Heart of Lothian'' 's opening guitar section reminds me very much of ''Hey You'' from ''The Wall'', which is fine by me! Around a minute and twenty seconds into the song, Mark Kelly gets some times to shine as he plays some wonderful piano parts that really fills out the song at this point. Not to mention, whenever Fish sings ''This tiiiime'', the way his voice wavers so drastically up and down lets us know that the old theatrical singer we know na dlove hasn't gone anywhere, and in fact does some of his best voice work ever on this record. Soon Kelly takes off on his piano sounds and brings the song's melancholic mood into a much softer, more joyous palor. The guitar soon follows suit by plaing the same tune overtop of the keybaords, but finally Rotghery once again breaks into an empassioned original-sounding guitar solo that completes this song's transformation into something completely different tham what it atarted out to be, which is a great thing, as many neo-rpog bands tend to to not evolve thir individual songs as much, but Marillion were the pioneers of this genre, and were influenced by the older prog guys, so that familiar and very wlecome song structure is present in their music, and certainly it is here. Great piece of music.''Waterhole (Expresso Bongo)'' is the first track on the album that can possibly be considered as 'heavy', and even then that's pushing it. The opening sounds are like something I would expect from a Robert Fripp album, or some other ambient noise-driven record, but then the song soon changes and becomes quite aggressive, with some distorted guitar riffs serving as a blanket for the intense keyboard work to colour the top of. There are some lyrical referrances to past songs to be found here as well, once again helping the concept as a whole connect properly. This song doesn't really speak to me much, though, and I think it is just because of how short it is, it doesn't egt the chance to evolve and change and become something interesting. So in a way, it the polar opposite of the previous song, and honestly, quite boring. But since it is so short, it doesn't take much effort to sit through it, so the album for me is still listenable as a whole without any breaks.''Lords of the Backstage''. Ah! Now this is music! Great riff at the beginning, great tune throughout, amazing vocal performance, consice instrumentation, no filler or overly-long moments in the whole thing. While musically it is a bit stagnant, it isn't very long at all, and helps lighten the mood once again on this very multi-emotional roller coaster of an album. Good!''Blind Curve'' is the longest songon the album, and has so many amazing parts to it, it is going to be difficult to touch upon them all, so I will give a general overview. Well, first of all, absolutely SOARING soundscapes provided by Steve Rothery's gitar wizardry gives this track the epic feel that it needs to hold ones interest for such a long stretch of time (nearly ten minutes). Remember, this is Neo-prog, so Marillion needed to be clever here in order to hold the casual listener's interest, and they obviousely did, since this record was their biggest hit during the Fish era. Post-Hackett Genesis could learn a thing or two from these guys. See, Marillion knows how to mix pop and prog well, unlike Genesis' later years. Around three minutes in, Fish delivers his best vocal work on the record, hands-down, with very unique jumps from highs to lows while keeping the melody something worth listening to. It's great. Just great. Close to 4:30, Rothery displayes some fabtastic spacey-guitar work accompanied by . . . nothing. The song is silent at this point other than the guitar, and I love it! See, this is what makes prog great for me. These are bands who know when to play alot, and then at the same time they know when to leave enough space for everything to sink in. If yopu constantly beat the listener over the head with aggressive rocking, they will never fully appreciate the beauty of your band's music. Marillion does not make that mistake ever, and this section of the song really shows off their uncanny ability to hit the listener right in the gut with some of the loudest, most powerfull silence a band could offer. The song soon becomes much darker and more atmospheric, with big echoing drums and some truly wicked flanger-effected bass playing. Fish's proclamation: ''Childhood . . . my childhood . . . misplaced childhood . . . give it back to me.'' is very haunting and heartfelt, I think. Really great track, and those are only some aspects of what make it great, there is alot more that I could fill up an entire webpage with in regard to any of the songs, really. But that is the general idea. Bottom line: it's a great song.''Childhood's End?'' Featueres another great riff at it's opening, and then maintaines the same quality throughout. A great song that I feel could have been the album closer, as it givesme a certain sense of resolution at it's end.''White Feather'' Is the other 'weak' track on the album, if you can call any of them really weak at all. But there is one moment in which the music builds up and then has one last burst of energy that is always nice to listen to, but on the whole, not all that impressive. I'm not going to detract any stars from the rating, however, because it is too great of an album to not give it's due just because of a couple of duds.This is the pinnacle of what made Fish-era Marillion great. If you wanna know what they were all about, this is a great place to start. May even be a bit more accessible than ''Jester'', even though it has a couple of poppy tunes. To be frank, even the lighter songs on MISPLACED CHILDHOOD don't feel all that radio-friendly, so I don;t think the 'hits' they had on this record was intentionall. It isn't as if they decided to record some totally unrelated pop material in hopes of hting it big; every song on this album flows naturally, none of it feels contrived. A true masterpiece, to be sure. As far as I am concerned, essential. Five stars. If you don't like this album, then Marillion probably isn't for you, because this had everything that made them great present within it.Now, I am very tired, and after staying up all night writing this review and listening to the album numerous times, I believe I deserve a nap. Nighty-night.Oh . . . and happy listening, of course."

          "text": "A long time favourite of my father's, it was inevitable that I one day should come to Marillion. The celebrated prog revitalisers of the '80s - celebrated, idolised, loathed and neglected all at the same time by the prog community - are at least an important band in the history of music.Misplaced Childhood, the bands third album, is by many considered the pinnacle of their career and it is with caution and mixed feelings I approach the album. It isn't the first time I've delved into the dark, bitter world of Fish, and having said that, this would possibly not be the first time I'd leave it after a few spins. I've always felt that this was nothing more than pretentious (it's always a risk to use that word as a prog rock fan...) sophisto-rock with a distinct '80s flair. Neither have Fish's vocals ever been a favourite of mine. And while I stay true to those statements, this time something happened. It clicked, for lack of better words. Suddenly I felt a strong will to listen to Marillion those times you know you want hear something, but can't put your finger on what.Because behind the thick pretentious layer (the neutral meaning of the word...) is an album full of quality and emotion. And if put in context, the glam-hair-metal heydays of the decade, this is nothing short of a masterpiece. However, on a personal note and speaking as one who didn't live through those days, I don't find it that good.The production smells like the 80's. I've used the Rush albums from the same era as comparison before. Cold, hollow, electronic, restrained and disciplined are words that come to mind. But just as the '70s had its characteristic sound - but with a little more variation - I've never been put off by this. It's great with records that reflect their time, and an interesting cultural phenomenon. Sharp drums, somewhat in the back and 80's keys are other trademark attributes, and Misplaced Childhood is not an exception. Steve Rothery's guitar is highly emotional and crisp and clean, and the true pleasure of the album. Enchanting, hypnotizing from time to time. A fact that fits well with the dark concept. Sometimes he's very close to '80s-Alex Lifeson, but I'll leave out who influenced who, or if there is an influence at all. Could be either way, as far as I'm concerned. Ian Mosley is an expressive and powerful drummer and together with Pete Trewavas he forms a stable rythm section. But above all, this is an album very heavy on vocals and lyrics. Sometimes too heavy, as the other musicians almost drown behind Fish. I'd like more focus on the rest of the talent in the band, as some of the band's finesse is lost by that fact alone.Like all Neo-prog I've heard to this date, atmosphere is the key to success. It's all very theatrical with the expressive vocals of Fish, texture keys and narrated - and moody instrumental - parts. Misplaced Childhood is in many ways a perfect marriage between commercial catchy melodies and progressive complexity and atmospheres. And while this gives an edge in some camps, it's just as much a drawback in others. I'll settle for a place somewhere in between and complain about cohesion instead, and the shorter tracks, while still good, feels slightly out of place.With all things considered, I'll award this my most glowing three stars ever. And I've most certainly built up hunger for more Marillion. Very interesting.//LinusW"

          "text": "I normally try to come up with something witty on this line but - Wow. Just wow.This is quite an amazing album. Now, I don't claim to be anything of an expert on the genre despite how many books/webpages/liner notes I've read, but one thing about all these things have something in common. They usually all talk about the saving grace that is Neo-Prog which emerged in the 80s to save our precious way of writing music from complete destruction. Of course when talking about the subgenre of neo prog you often hear, ''Marillion this, Marillion that'', but it's really not until you hear one of their classic record that you know exactly why so many people talk about them. In first hearingMisplaced ChildhoodI could immediately understand the attachment so many proggers had with these guys then and now. This is an emotional thrillride of a record full of all the pomp rock progressive arrangements that we're used to in the progressive realm while having enough of a modern edge to make it big in the world they were born in.For those who (like myself) got into the genre late and have yet to approach this band I'll say a few words about the music, trying not to be redundant. To accurately sum up Marillion, takeGabriel-eraGenesisand slam it into the 80s without having their poppy edge. Indeed, the first couple times I listened to this record I said to my friends, ''this is one of the bestGenesisalbums I've ever heard!''. Lead singer Fish has a very Gabriel-eque voice here and it lends well to the music because it's different enough to keep them from becoming total clones of their apparent parent band. The music is a bit different as well, with bass and guitars keeping prominence for the most part. The music dares to use synths and dares to be catchy as well, but when it does it's done with such an emotional edge that no one can point a finger and scream ''POP!'' at them before becoming doused in the subjects of the song.Of the standouts of the record, there's quite a few.Pseudo Silk Kimonoopens up with a strong yet subdued synth and introduces Fish's voice. Short but effective. This segues into (arguably) the best short song on the record,Kayliegh, which is a stunning piece. Emotional, catchy and gorgeous this is the kind of prog that people would never have expected. The lines ''Do you remember...'' are almost tear jerking in their delivery and make for a very pleasant listen.Childhood's End?is another good one, this one heavier than some of the other tunes, and along withWaterholethere's a few rockers to be had here. The bass line onChildhood's End?is especially upbeat and makes for a lovely four minutes.The longer songs of course dominate. No one can deny how good it is to hear a song likeBitter SuiteorBlind Curvecoming out of 1985. Both divided into segments, they each play out like most prog (mini)epics do. A nice rising action makes for a satisfyingly heavy and emotional climax coming into the last minutes of the songs. Some very spine chilling moments to be had here.This one is a hard one to top. An amazing effort that if you've skipped until this point you should consider trying to look it up. I (and many others) say that this one is completely essential, not to be missed. 5 Hearts of Lothian out of 5!"

          "text": "Every once in a while I find an album that's a bonafide masterpiece of progressive rock and I become somewhat apprehensive about writing the review for it. I want to do it justice and describe it in such a way that others will be encouraged to discover it for themselves. \"Misplaced Childhood\" is one of those rare recordings that transcends the mundane and climbs to a level of artistic expression that is sublime. Not only is it flawless in its design and execution, it also delivers the kind of symphonic prog that satisfies me in every way possible. There's simply not a moment when I'm not totally absorbed and enchanted.I must commend the people of the UK for making this album #1 right smack dab in the middle of the 80s. As I recall, it was wholly ignored in the USA and that's our cross to bear. In 1985 we yanks were blindly oblivious to anything nearing the fringes of progressive rock because we had our heads stuck so far up our MTV virus-infected backsides that anything requiring more than 3 minutes of our attention (unless it was MJ's corny \"Thriller\" video) never got a glance. A band as courageous as Marillion might have blown some wind into the dying coals of prog over here but the record labels, obsessed with how a band looked on TV rather than how they sounded, never bothered to make us aware of their existence. Lord knows there were millions of proggers who would've loved to know about them.The opener, \"Pseudo Silk Kimono,\" with its sumptuous backdrop drawn by Mark Kelly's dense keyboards, instantly pulls you into their realm and sets the mood for the entire aural experience ahead. Vocalist Fish wields firmer control over his theatrical style on this album and the articulation of his hallucinogen-fueled words is yet another reason it soars so high. He's sad, alone and slightly out of his mind, shuffling aimlessly in his cheap robe \"wearing bracelets of smoke/naked of understanding\" and covered with \"nicotine smears/long, long dried tears.\" What follows is \"Kayleigh,\" a gorgeous song that could've been as big a hit in Dallas as it was in London had it only gotten a few spins on the radio. It owns all the characteristics of what I think neo-prog is in that it blends the progressive sensibilities of the 70s with the state-of-the-art studio techniques and instrumentation of the 80s to create a unique type of music. With this classy tune they had a popular single that provided vital exposure without cutting the corners of their integrity. Steve Rothery's guitar effects and Ian Mosley's drum sound are exceptional and Fish's lyrics about the euphoria of young love and the devastation resulting from its loss strike directly where it hurts most. \"Do you remember/chalk hearts melting on a playground wall?/do you remember/dawn escapes from moonwashed college halls?\" he pleads, \"I'm still trying to write that love song/it's more important to me now you're gone/maybe it'll prove that we were right/or prove that I was wrong.\"Kelly's piano leads into the beautiful \"Lavender\" with its tasteful dynamics and haunting melody. Here Fish faces the rueful realization that his lady love may be gone forever as he walks through a park. \". I heard children singing/they were running through the rainbows/they were singing a song for you/the one I wanted to write for you, for you\" he laments. His use of alliteration on this track is masterful as are Ian's drum rolls at the end. \"Bitter Suite\" is next and its five parts go through a slew of emotions ranging from despair and bewilderment to insecurity and disillusion. During the mysterious \"Brief Encounter\" he mutters \"the mist crawls from the canal/like some primordial phantom of romance/to curl under a cascade of neon pollen/while I sit tied to the phone like an expectant father.\" On \"Lost Weekend\" the group briefly streams into a surprising jazz motif and during \"Blue Angel\" they apply a heavier rock ballad feel while Fish tells of a desperate tryst. \"Two hundred francs for sanctuary/and she led me by the hand/to a room of dancing shadows/where all the heartache disappears.\" he sings. That's followed by the sensual \"Misplaced Rendevous\" in which a reunion with his former lover doesn't happen because \"the weekend career girl never boarded the plane.\" Mark continues to paint with deep keyboard hues, but for \"Windswept Thumb\" he employs his piano joined by Steve's acoustic guitar as Fish relates that he's \"on the outskirts of nowhere/on the ringroad to somewhere/on the verge of indecision.\"\"Heart of Lothian\" has a respectful Genesis-like atmosphere. Divided into two segments, \"Wide Boy\" slips into half-time as Fish seeks refuge among the rowdies he grew up with while on \"Curtain Call\" the drums are silent and the music drifts as if suspended in mid-air. He ends his wry commentary on escapism with \".and the man in the mirror had sad eyes.\" Menacing tribal drums underscore \"Waterhole (Expresso Bongo),\" a vicious rip into the underbelly of life in the pubs where girls are \"lying on every word and every arm/turning down their noses to the best lines and the cheap wines\" and the boys \"wear their lovebites for their crimes.\" An infectious 7/8 time signature is incorporated for the stunning \"Lords of the Backstage\" during which Mosley fiercely attacks his drumkit and Fish tries in vain to educate his lost lady about touring. \"A lifestyle with no simplicities/but I'm not asking for your sympathies/talk, we never could talk/distanced by all that was between us/a lord of the backstage/a creature of language/I'm so far out and I'm too far in.\" he confesses.\"Blind Curve\" is another multi-sectioned epic. \"Vocal Under a Bloodlight\" sports a hard beat and Fish proclaims that he's \"happy to be lonely\" but he's not convincing. \"Passing Strangers\" is softer in tone as he tells about being \"strung out under a necklace of carnival lights.\" Rothery gets to show off his guitar skills (both solo and in stacking harmony tracks) on \"Mylo,\" a number that features a lovely mix of instrumentation while Fish bemoans \"the price of infamy/the edge of insanity.\" After a short guitar interlude a growling synthesizer drone colors \"Perimeter Walk,\" a dramatic piece where he speaks, then shouts about the loss of his innocence. \"Threshold\" is huge in scale and it's as if the band has opened the floodgates to let the music gush while Fish finally looks out from his shell and sees that there are bigger issues in the world than his broken heart. \"I see black flags on factories/soup ladles poised on the lips of the poor/I see children with vacant stares/destined for rape in the alleyways/does anybody care?/I can't take anymore.\" he rants.On \"Childhoods End?\" Ian and bassist Pete Trewavas establish a solid groove while the guitars and keyboards splash up a brilliant, bright background. Fish accepts a brutal truth. The relationship is over and \"she's got to carry on with her life and you've got to carry on with yours.\" The album ends in the stately, military aura of \"White Feather\" as he's now turned his attention towards more noble causes like taking on the dogs of war. Accompanied by a glorious children's chorale the group fades into the ether proudly proclaiming \"you can't take away our hearts/ you can't steal our hearts away.\"The most impressive aspect of this incredibly cohesive piece of art lies in the way it flows seemingly without effort. Of course, that's what makes it so extraordinary because every progger knows that this kind of music is anything but easy to produce and even harder to record without a single seam showing. But that's exactly what this band, on only their third album, did. Their musicianship and their enigmatic frontman's vocal and lyrical prowess show a maturity and confidence that comes only through dedication and commitment to a common goal. With \"Misplaced Childhood\" Marillion achieved a level of excellence that the majority of bands can only dream of."

          "text": "Marillion - Misplaced ChildhoodThe only thing misplaced was direction... And they found direction!Review by ProgKidJoelMarillion's third studio album, MISPLACED CHILDHOOD, is considered by many to be their most consistent piece of art. This album is perhaps the least dark and distressing from the band with FISH, although is by no means soft, and is still emotionally stirring. Its worth mentioning this is a gapless album, and for maximum listening pleasure should be heard as such.The album opens with PSEUDO SILK KIMONO, a soft synth and guitar track with soft vocals. This sets the scene for a prog masterpiece, although this is not immediately evident in the follow up. This track has a genuine falsetto vocal track by FISH, and some lovely guitar effects by the master, ROTHERY.PSEUDO SILK KIMONO is followed by the band's biggest commercial hit so far, KAYLEIGH. This is an 80's classic, but be warned - This track isn't recommendable for prog purists and/or members of the anti-pop movement. Filled with great lyrics and genuine 80's synth effects, this carries nicely, and is a brutally catchy tune. The chorus is a real sing-along delight, and the guitar solo is fantastic. This is the track which blasted Marillion into the big time, making them worldwide number 1's overnight. The bass is also quite pleasing in this track, featuring a classic TREWAVAS bump-along texture.Kayleigh, I just wanna say I'm sorry, but Kayleigh I'm too scared to pick up the phone, to hear you've found another lover, to patch up our broken home!LAVENDER is another one of the singles from the track, and once again, features beautiful lyrics, vocals and all-round musicianship. This is a genuine ballad, but much like KAYLEIGH, isn't really prog based. This is a great track, albeit short. It flows into a guitar solo, and this is much extended on the single edit, which unfortunately is only available on the 2CD remaster. LAVENDER and KAYLEIGH lead perfectly into the album's first epic......BITTER SUITE. This track opens with some fantastic drum fills and spacey guitar. At around 1:30, this track takes structure with a flowing bass rhythm and eventual spoken word poetry from FISH. Soon after, some great vocals and synth effects come in. The lyrics in this track have always been a point of interest, as they are both incredibly poetic and emotionally insightful. This track eventually breaks into excellent drums with equally great guitar soloing over the top. This eventually reaches the same riff as LAVENDER, with different lyrics and a new vocal rhythm and harmony. The lyrics in this track are amongst the best any band has ever produced, and are near the peak for Marillion. This track is fantastic and leads perfectly into the next.HEART OF LOTHIAN was the third single from the album, although was in a much edited format. It picks up perfectly where BITTER SUITE left off. The sound is incredibly 80's on this track, but it (once again) proves that Marillion also have technical chops as musicians. The track picks up with a joint guitar and bass riff, leading into a great 80's tune. The guitar work on this song is amongst the cleanest I've ever heard, and the rest of the instruments work in perfect macro to compliment the unnatural cleanliness. Around halfway through, this track changes pace, slowing down, but continuing with more perfect guitar work. The last minute of this track is known as CURTAIN CALL, and is much softer than the former segment, names WIDE BOYS. The lyrics in CURTAIN CALL are also fantastic, and the guitar work is similar to that of PSEUDO SILK KIMONO.Marillion break up the pace with two shorter songs, the first being THE WATERHOLE: EXPRESS BONGO. This track opens with eerie guitar squeals, and continues with a great synth riff and some fantastic drum work. The lyrics are brutally angry on this track, and the guitar work remains demonic and erratic throughout the track's two minute length. There isn't too much to say about this track, and even though it is short, it adds massively to the sense of album over song, and also adds deeply and purposefully to the concept. This closes with much lighter synth work, leading into another track marked by the same changes.LORDS OF THE BACKSTAGE is the shortest track on the album, and once again, this is still able to add on a critical level to the album. This track has some lovely synth and guitar synchronization work, and the lyrics are both entertaining and insightful in this track. This short song leads into the albums true epic, BLIND CURVE.BLIND CURVE opens much more directly than many other tracks on this album, with great guitar work and near-immediate vocals. This is one of Marillion's most iconic tracks, and stands as the best on the album. Something of true fantasy and wonder about this song extends from its thoughtful phase changes - Through several moods and emotions, this track still feels like one, even after various breaks and splits. This is a great song, and is the centerpiece to the album. This is the album's proggiest track, featuring an epic guitar bridge worthy of the masters who inspired it. After this short interlude, the album has another spoken word moment over darkly intense bass noise and guitar effects. This is one of Marillion's most emotionally revealing moments, with an epic buildup and ear piercing vocals. This continues into a song of protest, and is one of Marillion's strongest which fall into this category. The lyrics are brilliant, although brutally honest about the problems faced by society today. This track ends with the same riff as LAVENDER, and flows into my favourite track on the album!CHILDHOOD'S END is one of Marillion's best songs - Deeply insightful and anthemic, although still lighthearted and enjoyable on a poppy level. This is a great track, and has references to the cover art and the loss of innocence described so vividly in this album. This song is mostly about moving onwards, and forgetting your past failures whilst learning from them. This is much better than the PINK FLOYD song of the same name, and this is one of the defining tracks on the album.You, poor child, that once loved, before they broke his heart. Our heart. The heart... That I believed was lost.This track closes in a great prog fashion, with speedy synth and drum work all round.WHITE FEATHER is another great short track, and the most important thing about this song is the closure it gives to the rest of the album. This is a truly angry track, but remains enjoyable and anthemic throughout its two minute lifespan. A choir of FISHES also helps this track to gain momentum, and the great instrumentation helps give a lot of quality to this song.This is probably Marillion's best album with FISH, and has the most unique atmosphere from the four. The sound is different to every other album, and there is a reason this disc is considered the defining neo-prog album, and one of the best 80's prog albums - Its as close to perfection as possible!An absolutely essential album for everyone!-Joel"

          "text": "Review number 250 - this is one of the most influential, timeless albums of the neo prog 80s. Marillion effectively reinvented prog.Misplaced Childhood is Marillion's magnum opus. Each track blends seamlessly into one overall powerful experience. It is the best the band have produced unlike the flawed Fugazi and Script for a Jester's Tear, this CD works on every level; musically, conceptually and vocally Fish has never been better.It begins with the hypnotic keyboard motif that I had to learn after hearing this. A beautiful serene piece of art with the wonderful vocals that chime in instantly transports us in to Marillion's world. The narrative begins of a man who is attempting to revisit his innocent childhood days that have been lost in the sea of fire - the trials and temptations that have plagued his life robbed him of the innocence and thus his dreams have been squashed.''Kayleigh'' is the bonafide single that all Marillion fans have heard. It was my introduction to the band, found on the best 80s compilation CDs. Steve Rothery blasts a memorable riff and the keyboards soar over the top with a crystalline sound that is essential mid 80s fair. The melody is wonderous and memorable and one of the best from the band as a result.''Lavender'' is another single that takes on the theme of the nursery ryhme that is a childhood memory but the lavenders - the positive side of life - is gone robbed by negative effects on the life of the protagonist.\"Bitter Suite\" features a beautiful piano with encircling guitar motifs that hook onto an infectious melody.\"Heart Of Lothian\" begins with an incredible introduction and them locks into an off beat metrical pattern that shifts from 4/4 to 7/8 and back again. There is an ethereal ambience in the keyboards that compliments the vocal prowess of Fish. His vocal gymnastics never tire on the ear on these tracks.\"Waterhole\" is an anthemic rocker that leads seamlessly into:\"Lords Of Backstage\" is an effective short transition track that segues into:\"Blind Curve\" and here is where the album really excels. The vocals are poetic and Fish's artistry is second to noe. There are dark overtones but it feels uplifting simultaneously. Listen to Fish build to the crescendo climax as he reflects on the dark memories - \"the childhood, the childhood, the childhood, oh please give it back to me\" and there is a significant break in the meter where the jagged guitar solo launches into full volume. It is an amazing track and one of the best I have heard from Marillion.\"Childhoods End?\" has a very deep bass line that throbs throughout and is significant to the dark tone of the lyrics. It is the end or the beginning of innocence? The concept is heavy handed but the real star of the track is Fish who wails up a storm with an amazing vocal performance: \"it was morning and I found myself mourning for a childhood that I thought had disappeared - I saw you... Hey you, surprised... to find the answers to the questions were always in your own eyes, do you realise.... for she's got to carry on with her life and you've got to carry on with yours...\" Simple and direct but effective to touch on the theme of a love lost and how to survive \"to be reborn in the shadow\" to find \"the leading light of destiny burning in the ashes of your memory...\" Powerful. I love the guitar riffs and the lead breaks over Fish's vocals \"There is no Childhood's End, There is no Childhood's End, oh lead me on\". Then the iambic pentameter changes completely in order to segue immediately into:\"White Feather\". A low key track that is a low point on the album but it certainly wraps it all up concluding the CD, fading away in true 80s style.How to conclude this review is to simply state the fact. This is as about as good as Marillion gets. The first few albums are all great but this is the masterpiece make no mistake. I would even be bold enough to state that if this album does not appeal to you, Marillion is perhaps not for you. But on the other hand for those of us who have discovered the genius of this band, this CD is truly a pleasurable experience. Great headphone music and one of the best outright examples of Neo Prog."

          "text": "Still I can't understand why MARILLION doesn't get the credit they deserve, yes it's true they have a strong GENESIS influence, but if you embrace a genre more than a decade after it's birth, most surely you will be influenced by one of the pioneers.It's also truth that the selection of keyboards is not the best, specially because in 1982 they got rid of their Mellotron and used an emulator that didn't sounded remotely as goodBut we must focus in the music, they were able to make excellent Prog in a decade that despised Prog and keep the genre alive, and \"Misplaced Childhood\" is one of the top albums of the decade.\"Misplaced Childhood\" starts with \"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" and it's soft beautiful Synth intro, that leads to a section where Fish proves why he is one of the best vocalists in Prog history, only supported by Mark Kelly's keys, does an amazing job keeping the interest of the listener and preparing us for \"Kayleigh\" which enters after a brilliant transition between songs, now the work of the band is complete and at this point Rothery defines what would be the new role of the guitar, as peer of the keyboards and not relegated to a second plane, amazing song, despite the critics.\"Lavender\" starts with an extremely beautiful piano intro and Fish's peculiar style as a story teller, everything sounds natural and coherent and Mosley with the powerful drums adds the energy required when the song needs a change. At this point Fish makes a radical change from storyteller to singer and does it with amazing proficiency, only 2:25 minutes but sometimes less is more, great song.\"Bitter Suite\" starts with that mysterious keyboard intro that became MARILLION'S trademark in songs as \"Assassin\" that usually lead to a vibrant passage, in this case they choose a tense narration to create more suspense, and Fish singing in an almost howling style with his unique Scottish accent until Mosley again announces a radical change with a short drumming, the whole band joins the song and Rothery assumes his role of leader of the band, up to this point not a single weak moment.\"Heart of Lothian\" sounds like a more ambitious work, carefully structured with an elaborate introduction, and a complex development with sudden and subtle changes sometimes lead by the vocals, in other cases by the soft piano, but around the second minute the radical change comes, a prepared explosion of power and musicality keeps the listener at the edge of the seat not knowing what to expect next, as usual Fish jumps from soft and gentle to aggressive and vibrant. As a note, if the changes in most Symphonic bands are sudden and surprising, MARILLION prepares each change, going step by step. Maybe they loose a bit of surprise but prove how carefully elaborate each song is.\"Waterhole (Expresso Bongo)\" is something different, for the first time the band seem to set the beast free, if everything was gradually and carefully planned, now they allow themselves to attack the listener with everything the have, not a second of rest,As in the previous track, \"Lords of the Backstage\" doesn't prepare the listener for anything, they start strong and even let the intensity of the track to grow as the seconds pass, as announcing an explosion of music, somehow in the vein of \"Tubular Bells\" but before the climax reaches, the short track ends leaving the conclusion for the dramatic \"Blind Curve\", in which Mark Kelly adds his peculiar organ combined with Rothery's guitar in a collaboration that reminds the one patented by Banks & Hackett, but different, more aggressive, with a vocalist that guides the band to an excellent guitar solo, radical changes, lush keyboards and a very solid interplay between Trewavas and Mosley make of this track one of the highest points of the album, 9 minutes of first class Progressive Rock.\"Childhood's End?\" reminds me instantly of \"And Then They Were Three\", but if GENESIS would had sounded like this, I would kept following the band for some years instead of closing that chapter. Strong, perfectly structured, dramatic when required, everything is in it's place and sounds great.The album ends with \"White Feathers\" an excellent and surprising finale.Some people may believe I go too far with my rating, but if \"Script for a Jester's Tear\" was the birth of Neo Prog, \"Misplaced Childhood\" completely defined the sub-genre and raised the bar so high that the new bands would have to work very hard to reach this level. If this is not essential, I don't know the meaning of the word, so 5 stars is my rating."

          "text": "This is where Marillion Mark 1 realizes its full potential. It's full of catchy songs, laid back atmospheric passages and every track flows nicely into the other. The unifying vision of this album lifts individual tracks to a level that is higher then their intrinsic qualities. Even run of the mill poppy tunes like Kayleigh and Lavender work perfectly in this context.I'm sure this album and especially the popularity of it, is a thorn in the flesh of prog purists but what is the relevance of that debate? Aren't we just after discovering and enjoying outstanding music whatever genre it is? Even if that genre could be tagged pop-prog. 4.5 stars"

          "text": "After years when it looked that progressive rock is dead or is still alive in a form of old great names ( and far not so great their new albums), Marillion came as new wave of old feeling.To be honest I never liked neo-prog music ( and don't like it till now). For me there were Rush (till their Signals), then Saga , then -some silence, and then - Marillion. Just more modern form of progressive mainstream rock. I was happy with their few first albums, and Misplaced Childhood possibly is the one, where they got their peak. If earlier works were still Gabriel/Genesis connected, there they found their own soundMelodic, different, technically strong, never boring - this album was a new prog standard for the generation. Unhappily, the band didn't stay at their top for too long. After Fish left the band, they became not too much interesting, and ( what is much worst) gave inspiration for myriad of faceless boring clones, which later formed the basis for so named neo-prog.This album could be recommended for widest range of listeners as one of the best neo-prog examples ever."

          "text": "The jewel of the Fish yearsAnd the best Neo album I've personally ever heard. Events in my personal life have had me thinking about the past a lot lately, I suppose it's just the next midlife crisis. Some would say I look backwards too much but I would counter that too many people seem to be running from their past, which is no better frankly. I think there is much to be learned by thinking about events and outcomes of decades gone by, as I've found they can be clues to explaining things in your midst today. Is it coincidence that this old friend found its way back into my rotation after many years of not hearing it? Maybe. But the rush of memories and emotions it brought back were nothing short of intriguing.\"Misplaced Childhood\" is a masterpiece for so many reasons and it is easily the best of the Fish years. The album comes from the high point of the first Marillion era, when the band members said they were confident and happy, and stated that the album pretty much \"wrote itself.\" The good times were short lived of course but what a statement they left. The thematic concepts of the album come primarily from one wild night when Fish took a double hit of some solid LSD and spent the night writing between bouts of freaking out, providing yet more evidence that some of the best rock music ever written was assisted by chemical inspiration, as much as some would like to deny that fact.\"An envelope arrived one of these days. Inside there was a short letter from an old girlfriend with the recommendation to digest the accompanying contents - a tab of very strong acid. Very Alice indeed! Not having indulged for a while I swallowed a cautious half, and after a few hours and with a pleasant euphoria, I took the other - setting off on my bike to Steve Rothery's house. Very bad mistake....Steve had to drive me home and after locking all the doors I set off into a long white-knuckle roller-coaster of a night....I immersed myself in a warm bath for a while, returning to the womb and trying to reassemble myself. I spent the rest of the night crouched on the floor listening to music, watching walls breathe....I'd started to doodle and scribble in my lyric book on the off chance of catching something from the trip. It was sometime during the night that I was visited. 'Incubus' was on the deck; I was in 'Padres Bay' when suddenly I felt a child standing behind me on the stairs. I knew he was dressed as a soldier and vanished as soon as he entered the corner or my eye. Perhaps it was my muse; perhaps it was the drug. It was enough to propel me into reaming off a large scrawl of prose. Contained within were the diamonds and structure on which would hang up the entire concept of Misplaced Childhood.\"[Fish, from Marillion.com]Lyrically and musically the album is almost magical in its successes. The concepts Fish wrote about were personal mostly, but great rock concepts have a way of allowing the listener to assume emotional control of the content: \"Kayleigh\" becomes *your* lost love, the melting chalk hearts from *your* playground, the haze of summer lawns emerge from our *own* memories. (Not literally of course, the names and places will be different, but you catch my drift-we internalize the tracks to our own experience). He delivers the storylines masterfully and with incredible passion.The band rises to his challenge of performance here delivering heartfelt melodies, interesting proggy interludes, beautifully linked songs and transitions, recurring themes, and spirited jamming. When you consider all of the elements the album can compete with works like Dark Side or Trick of the Tail (while it falls short of Floyd for me it easily bests TotT). But think about Dark Side's recipe: great transitions, poignant lyrics, interesting proggy moments and great melody....same recipe. The difference is mainly in the \"sound\" of the two bands and the time periods. Some proggers will blast the album for being too overtly accessible but in reality it is not so different than those highly approachable '70s albums.I love how dynamic and briskly paced everything is kept. From the mysterious beginning of \"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" to those amazing first chords of \"Kayleigh\", which if you listen carefully perfectly sound-simulate the effect of time travel leading to the \"do you remember?\" lines of the songs....just freakin' perfect melding of sound and theme. They dive right into another contagious track with \"Lavender\" showcasing Rothery's abilities to mimic that gorgeous, transcendent Gilmour quality of pleasurable note production. \"Bitter Suite\" begins with an understated but dramatic little drum solo, a great touch by Mosley. \"Blue Angel\" revisits the \"Lavender\" melody as the album displays the kind of recurring themes throughout that give it that cohesive, confident, and deeply considered compositional base.\"Misplaced Rendevous\" opens with a lovely acoustic swirl before \"Windswept Thumb\" closes this amazing suite with my favorite, simple piano melody. Mark Kelly lavishes the album cover to cover in beautiful texture and mood, while Pete Trewavas delivers this huge, thumping bass throughout....giving the album some real rock punch! The second side tries to best \"Bitter Suite\" with a 10-minute emotional bloodbath in \"Blind Curve\" which deals with the death of a close friend (I believe.) The interlude between \"Mylo\" and \"Perimeter\" is fantastic---and the pain, loss, and anger expressed through the suite is deep.Just when it begins to get a bit much at the end they pull it back nicely with a refrain of the pleasing \"Lothian\" riff. If only they had ended with the upbeat and natural sounding conclusion of \"Childhood's End\" which so perfectly wrapped it. The one black eye of this album is the tacking-on of the dreadful last track \"White Feather\" with its cringe-worthy, utopian lyrics, which was simply so unnecessary. My rating of 5 stars is tainted by the fact that I hate the last track, so I must qualify that I stop the disc after \"Childhood's End.\" Perhaps that's cheating, but hey, it's my review. I can't penalize such a treasure like this for one dud track.Get yourself a remastered version of this album and hear one of the best rock albums of the 1980s. The cynical (of which I often include myself in their ranks) may mock you, but when you get this disc in your car alone, you'll enjoy it just like the other guilty pleasure albums people sometimes diss....Grand Illusion, Wind and Wuthering, Moving Pictures, Snow Goose, In Absentia, Point of Know Return, etc. \"Misplaced Childhood\" may not be the greatest progressive album but it was a perfect moment in time, a band hitting full stride, and somewhere to take refuge in the mid '80s."

          "text": "Gabriel era Genesis... but two steps back.This is a difficult album to review because it was meant to appeal to classic era prog fans (such as myself) but the quality of the music is way inferior to any of the classic bands they are trying to emulate. First of all, I have to make clear that I don't doubt of the capabilities, talent and potential of each and everyone of the musicians involved in this album since I've seen what they can do, specially on \"Script for a Jester's Tear\", which is almost the \"lost Gabriel era Genesis album\". Here, again, Marillion displays their Genesis influence to an extent that it becomes a clone, but this time they add a Pink Floyd \"The Wall\" era element to the music. As I said before, these influences and overall sound would appeal to prog fans but the compositional quality is quite diminished in comparison to their debut in an accomplished effort of making prog more accessible (indeed, it peaked on the charts).I have always said that if you want to emulate a classic band without being dull you should, at least, be able to keep the musical standard and be somewhat original. \"Script for a Jester's Tear\" accomplished that masterfully, producing pieces that aren't just copies of already existing Genesis tunes. But now, Marillion embarked the pretentious project of making Gabriel era Genesis accessible to the masses but by doing that they sacrificed their Genesis-like musical standard (and saying this is a enormous compliment to their debut) and everything that made this prog classic's music interesting. I have nothing against pretentiousness when it makes things interesting, but this time it bores me to death. At the end, the pretension of this album, unlike classic-era prog, is to simplify the music. So, instead of being progressive they are being regressive! Something common among several Neo-Prog bands.This album is considered a masterpiece by many and I can understand its appeal: it caries the essence of some of our favorite bands, it is easy to comprehend and has interesting lyrics. Not only that, it was one of the few sources of prog in the 80's and it got some airplay, therefore it produced the illusion and hope that the progressive rock era wasn't over. But we have to realize that: 1) The music lacks originality, 2) Is simplistic and 3) If you wanted to get 80s prog King Crimson, Rush and other authentically progressive bands where active during the decade. Well.... we can say this is the cornerstone of Neo- Prog, which in my book isn't really a compliment (although there are some enjoyable and decent Neo-Prog albums out there...clearly, this isn't one of them).Now to the music. Fish has a voice outstandingly similar to Peter Gabriel's (and that is another big compliment), his performance and lyrics are the highlight and only interesting aspect of the album. The guitar work is actually closer to David Gilmour's than to Steve Hackett's, but nothing really noteworthy comes out of it. The rhythm section is apt but, again, uninteresting. The keyboards are not bad, creating an atmosphere with lots of unexploited potential and some pleasant piano interventions appear every now and then.There is actually no technical flaw here, but the uninteresting and boring music makes me want to give the lowest rating. Nonetheless, the great vocal performance, technically flawless playing, pristine recording and, to a lesser extent, historic significance of this record (it kept the symphonic prog sound tradition alive) made me reconsider.Total: 2.40.Two stars for a decent, boring, unoriginal and regressive album. Just for collectors of prog history."

          "text": "My 150th Review on ProgArchives!For my 150th review here at ProgArchives, I've wanted to discuss an album that is really special to me. After some tough decision making, I've decided that it was finally time to review one of my all-time favorite albums - Marillion'sMisplaced Childhood. I have been holding off this review for a long time, for an almost unexplainable reason. I've been afraid that after I put my own critical spin on such a special album that it might loose a little bit of its luster.Misplaced Childhoodhas been one of those albums that has really shaped my life recently. I have been listening to this album on a nearly twice-a-day basis for well over two months, memorizing every word and note until it is engraved into my head. Words can't describe how fantastic I think this album is, but I'll try my best to explain how awesomeMisplaced Childhoodis throughout this review. But if you really want to know how good this album is, just go out and buy it - you won't be disappointed.After a slight stumble withFugazi, Marillion comes back stronger than ever with this 1985 masterpiece. OnMisplaced Childhoodwe here a much more mature and developed band. The production is better, the compositions are fantastic, and the band sounds even better on their respective instruments. When you add on the beautiful lyrics from Fish, a well-crafted concept, and some of the most heartfelt music on the face of the earth, it really makes for a fantastic album.I'm usually a sucker for concept albums, so that does increase my enjoyment ofMisplaced Childhoodquite a bit. This is an extremely well-crafted concept, and should set an example for other bands. It reuses just enough musical and lyrical themes to give the listener a great emotional impact without ever becoming repetitive or derivative. I just can't praise the seamless flow of this album enough. All of the songs flawlessly flow from each other. I wouldn't have the song order any other way.The musicianship is fantastic, as we're always used to from Marillion. Of course, Fish takes center stage on this album with his emotional lyrics and fantastic vocals, but the other four musicians have no shortage of great material onMisplaced Childhood. Steve Rothery plays some of his finest solos ever on this album. He really is a fantastic guitarist and suits the mood of the album perfectly. Mark Kelly's lush and melodic keyboards set the mood of the album perfectly. He doesn't have as many solos as Steve Rothery, but he sets a fantastic rhythm (and sometimes lead) section. Ian Mosley's drumming has gotten much better sinceFugazi. I found his drumming a little uninteresting on the previous album, but that isn't at all the case here. He does a great job throughout the entire course of the album. Pete Trewavas does a great job as well. That man really knows how to play the bass, and he shows that he's the master throughout all ofMisplaced Childhood. None of the musicians ever \"shred\" or show off, but they don't need to. Marillion is made up of top-notch musicians, and you can tell that from their distinct melodic style.The production is unquestionably from the 80's. The synthesizers, electronic drum sound, and guitar tones may turn some people off, but I really enjoy it. I honestly love the production of 80's neo-prog albums like this, and I think it givesMisplaced Childhoodsome of its charm.This album contains 10 songs, all of which are fantastic and worth hearing. My favorites areKayleigh,Heart of Lothian,Lords of the Backstage,Blind Curve, andChildhood's End. I realize that I've mentioned half of the songs, but they are all so fantastic that I can't narrow it down any more. Keep in mind that all of the songs segue into each other, and are meant to be listened to together. My only complaint with this entire album is the closing track,White Feather. It's a good song, but I don't think it's a great way to end such a fantastic album. If it were placed somewhere in the middle of the album I would be fine with it, but it isn't as strong of a closer as I would've liked it to be. It's a minor complaint in the big picture, however. This is a fantastic album, and one mediocre track can't change that.Conclusion:Misplaced Childhoodis a masterpiece of progressive rock, and is one of my all time favorite albums. I can't stop praising this fantastic album, and I don't think I ever will. You aren't a true prog fan until you ownMisplaced Childhood, so do yourself some justice and go out and buy it now. Of course my rating will be 5 stars for this absolutely essential progressive rock album. This is one of the defining albums in the genre.5 stars."

          "text": "The album that broke the band big time, 'Misplaced Childhood' was the group's third album and, commercially speaking at least, represents the apex of the 1980's neo-prog revival. The album featured that rare beast for a prog band: a hit single in the shape of the Fish- penned honest-to-god love song 'Kayleigh' which, again, represented a peak of sorts, topping various charts across Europe and giving the band some valuable exposure in the process. Fish would, of course, leave the behind three years and one album later in 1988, but the four albums produced whilst he was the group's figurehead represent the band's true golden era, an almost perfect merging of dark lyricism, shiny neo-prog musicanship, fantastical artwork and, the magic ingredient, a commercially-viable pop-edge that gave the band unexpected success in the face of doubting critics who were championing punk, new wave, goth-rock and synth-pop above anything produced by Marillion or their less successful contemporaries, the likes of Twelfth Night, Pendragon, IQ, Pallas and Abel Ganz. 'Misplace Childhood' and it's follow-up 'Clutching At Straws' were both big sellers, repaying EMI's faith in the much-maligned band, and the fact that Marillion found any kind of success whatsoever is actually quite extraordinary considering the musical circumstances surrounding them. The Fish-era band(four of which are still in the band at the time of writing, 2010, with lead-singer Mark Hogarth replacing Fish in 1989) can probably be seen as the last great progressive rock band to be accepted by the mainstream, and certainly the last prog band to be associated with a major-label. Since the beginning of the 1990's the band's sound has changed greatly, with their new material completely at odds with their 1980's output, but such is the nature of the genre. After all, it's called 'progressive' rock. These days prog is very much a niche genre made by fans for fans on independent labels. The reformation of several big-name bands from the 1970's golden-era, such as Genesis and Yes amongst others, has shown that their is still much blood in the old prog body, and that the newfound popularity across Europe and America can be attributed, in part, to bands like Marillion who bravely decided to try and re-invigorate the genre in the face of much ridicule after the bloody punk whirlwind had come trashing through the land. Punk, of course, was short, brutish and a rather nasty short-lived phenomenon that momentarily put pay to the genre's big beasts, but the seeds of recovery were sown at the beginning of the 1980's and out of the dark punk forest came Marillion and company, complete with their double-necked guitars and keyboard castles. Unlike their (friendly) rivals, they found worldwide commercial acceptance, and, although thy didn't know it at the time, 'Misplaced Childhood' became the last great hurrah of the progressive rock genre. A true concept piece, it's an album thats well worth a place in any serious prog fans collection. STEFAN TURNER, LONDON, 2010"

          "text": "I`ve been quite reluctant about writing a review on this album. The reason why is that its great success had both positive and negative effects. The positive ones were immediatly felt: it brought the band (and the neo prog movement) international exposure and fame, something unimaginable for the 80\ufffds. Before Misplaced Childhood prog music was a thing of the past and the new bands were seen by critics and press as something of an anomaly, forever to remain in its small underground place. Now they were on the charts with a number two single (followed by two others). The album showed that prog music was far from spent or dead. A new generation had arrived. Critics went ballistic with that.But it also had negative side effects. In the long run. Misplaced Childhood was also seen by hardcore prog fans as a sell out, Marillion going pop. And I cannot help to think that the prejudice so many people still have against neo prog derives from the fact that Kayleigh was a hit single. This narrow-mindness would be later enhanced by the fact that most neo prog bands were then pressed to follow suit, every recording company asking for its prog acts to come up with something similar. It may explains why so many new groups did try to do it at least once (certainly IQ, Pallas and Twelfth Night tried - and failed). The fact that bands like Yes and Genesis at the heigh of their careers did have hit singles on the pop charts never crossed the minds of those who critize neo prog. Go figure!But what about the album itself? Was it really something (intentionally) commercial? Hardly. The music might sound softer and more accessible, but it is still a symphonic prog album and no one could predict that it would be such hit. In fact the band had to fight with their label to release a conceptual record, something EMI didn\ufffdt even wanted to hear about. Concept albums were a thing of the past and nobody could expect it to be welcomed in a time critics still praised punks and accused prog bands of being everything that was wrong with the 70\ufffds scene. Thank God the band prevailed. With this CD they proved the world that prog music was not only alive and well, buit it also had a whole new market.So this CD has a history. And I am a BIG Marillion fan. However, Misplaced Childhood with all its importance is not one of my favorites. to me. Their brilliant debut Script For A Juster\ufffds Tear comes first, Clutching At Straws is second, Fugazi third and then I have Misplaced Childhood.. I still think it is a great album, like everything this group did with former singer Fish. The LP\ufffds first side is simply marvelous. I loved the concept too. It was something quite bold and new for the time. However, the second side was not that inspired and it lacked the tremendous energy side A had plenty of. Besides, the production is far from perfect. So much I liked the live La Gazza Ladra CD version (where they play the whole Misplaced album on the second disc) better.Marillion was a band that it was as important to prog in the 80\ufffds as Yes was for the 70\ufffds. While Fish was on board, they could do no wrong. And I really like this CD with all the flaws I mentioned before. So although I still think it is not their best, it is also a fantastic work, then and now. That\ufffds why I rated it four stars: it is an excellent addition to any prog music collection. Maybe I should give it an extra half star for its historical importance. I guess it is also a classic. But Marillion did even better ones. Thank you, guys. I love you."

If only I hadn't grown up on Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, and Tony's masterful keys.1. \"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" (2:13) great vocal but those keyboard strings are so dated! (4/5)2. \"Kayleigh\" (4:03) I always liked this song despite its pop formula. (8.5/10)3. \"Lavender\" (2:27) love the way this one builds. (8.75/10)4. \"Bitter Suite\" (5:53) great instrumental intro with Hackett-like guitar leads into Andy Summers texture behind Fish's narrated story prep. Then we transition into a rumba-like dance groove for an excellent Rothery solo (maybe the first one I've ever been impressed by). A little bit borrowed from \"As Sure Is Eggs Is Eggs\" for the next section (which I was expecting to be the song's finale). The final slowed down/softened section is curious--how it belongs--and why it bleeds/feeds directly into the next suite is a mystery to me. (9.25/10) - I. Brief Encounter - II. Lost Weekend - III. Blue Angel - IV. Misplaced Rendez-vous - V. Windswept Thumb5. \"Heart Of Lothian\" (6:02) Really! Getting excited about singing about \"wide boys\"?!?! The continuous wailing of Rothery's guitar feels quite at conflict with Fish's impassioned vocal. They may be expressing their passion about the same thing, in different ways, but it's like putting apples with onions. (8.25/10) - I. Wide Boy - II. Curtain Call6. \"Waterhole (Expresso Bongo)\" (2:12) interesting drum & percussion. Glad to have that guitar in the background: This mix works! Nice dynamic music--and appropriate vocal/lyric. (4.75/5)7. \"Lords Of The Backstage\" (1:52) Not up to the rest. (4.25/5)8. \"Blind Curve\" (9:29) a very well constructed/designed prog epic that helps me see, for perhaps the first time, this band's own unique vision. The talents and personalities still seem very built upon the members of GENESIS, but they've finally come up with a song that, for the most part, feels as if they might be breaking free of the themes and motifs of their inspirateurs. (17.75/20) - I. Vocal Under A Bloodlight - II. Passing Strangers - III. Mylo - IV. Perimeter Walk - V. Threshold9. \"Childhoods End?\" (4:32) What?! Where's the prog? (8/10)10. White Feather (2:23) Oh, good! They found a little more prog (though there's a little FLOCK OF SEAGULLS/early SIMPLE MINDS in here as well) (4.25/5)Total Time: 41:05I like the flow and connectivity of the album (after \"Kayleigh\") and the rhythm tracks are outstanding but the guitar play and vocal performances are often a bit incongruous with the music--which makes me wonder if, at times, the band members are all on the same page; how much tension was there within the band at this time? Even so, the sound engineering is definitely a step up from their debut album (I can hear everything!)B/four stars; an excellent Neo Prog contribution to Prog World."

Now this is preferable to eating Fish's lyrics, which in quantity rival the most excessive American all-you-can- stand buffets. But yes, I must admit this is a good album, and one of the first I have heard from early British neo that points to the better Euro neo that would follow in subsequent decades.The album starts very strongly, with the sinister \"Pseudo Silk Komono\" yielding to the appealing \"Kayleigh\". The latter's verses are magical, as is its lengthy instrumental break, but the chorus is almost tragically uninspired in every sense. \"Lavender\" and \"Bitter Suite\" both share another weak melody, and Fish's observations are no comfort. But the highlight here is the grandiose \"Heart of Lothian\" where the Scots singer one-ups Peter Gabriel and stands almost on his own, notwithstanding continued stalwart support from Steve Rothery. The closing numbers are similarly varied with alternating delicacy and potency.While I cannot deny the import of this disk independent of its colossal popularity, I think \"flawed masterpiece\" might be an accurate description. That is, for fans of this style, it's a TKO, but for those more into a collective approach to prog, \"Misplaced Childhood\" seems anchored around an oversized Fish. Perhaps I should be \"Brave\" and look at the Hogarth era again?"

          "text": "I'm not going to call this album the band's magnum opus, because, in my humble opinion, the next incarnation of the band went on to make two such albums. It is, however, the towering height of both the Fish era and also what we now call neo prog in the 1980's, a monster smash hit of an LP, which, in turn, spawned three incredibly big hit singles, a generation of girls by the name of Kayleigh, and all without face paint on as well!The direction the band had taken in Fugazi, heightened commerciality fused with progressive rock, reached its zenith with this album. Whoever would have thought that a concept album revolving around an autobiographical account of life's ups and downs and societal ills would have been so popular in the era of post punk and new romanticism?Side one has the hits Kayleigh, Lavender, and Heart Of Lothian. The first is pure pop/prog joy. The second is a great poem set to music, although the only minor gripe I have about Lavender is the fact that the single version (which was extended from the album version) features one of the most achingly beautiful guitar solos ever committed to vinyl of all time, let alone by Steven Rothery, and was absent from the album. Hearts Of Lothian is a simple barnstormer of a song, with Fish wearing his heart on his roots sleeve and the band playing as if their lives depended upon it. By this time, they were so massive that the pop video even featured TV celebrities doing star turns. The end of the track slows down to a sensitive backing track with Fish baring his soul to us all.The other tracks on side one are Pseudo Silk Kimono, a slow and thoughtful introduction to the work as a whole, and Bitter Suite, which is a superb progressive ballad and leads nicely into the Hearts track.Side two can comfortably be called the more progressive side, and proceeds to give Fish's, at times, exceptionally bleak view of the world. I remember more than a few letters in music papers at the time bemoaning the fact that at least Roger Waters was old enough to moan about all in sight, whilst Fish was a mere stripling. I find it utterly brilliant, with a relentless pace virtually unchecked throughout.Waterhole leads into a massive rocker, Lords Of The Backstage, one of the finest tracks the band ever recorded. The main epic of the album, Blind Curve. Nine minutes of dark and lyrically poetical symphony. Childhood End and White Feather close the album, in which all of the demons are finally exhaled.There are no standout performances on this. This is the sound of a band playing together at the top of their game and all in the same direction. It all culminated in a fantastic festival called Garden Party held at Milton Keynes Bowl with, amongst others, Jethro Tull supporting to a massive audience. As most of the band have said since, they should have stopped there and rested for a couple of years.This is an essential album, and easily deserves the full five stars. There is not a weak moment on it, and for those who do not own it, it is extremely important to the understanding and appreciation of progressive rock at the time of its release."

I remember each word and each note of the whole Misplaced Childhood and I've played it in a cover band when I was young. I still remember to have purchased it together with Soft Machine's Land of Cockayne. Two great albums.Misplaced Childhood is the first Marillion's concept album so exhamining it track by track has a little sense even though \"Kayleigh\" has become a hit single and gave them a lot of popularity. The structure of this album has something of The Dark Side of the Moon. The most rocky track is Waterhole which opens the side B as Money does on DSOTM, and the two final songs Childhood's End and White Feather have the structure of Brain Damage and Eclipse. This is the only pence that I can add to what has already been written about this albumSaid so, the music itself has very few of Pink Floyd apart some Rothary's solos but unlike the two previous studio albums it has also less of Genesis. Fish is in an excellent shape and all the album is very well arranged.Good lyrics and consistent melodies complete the picture.One of the very few progressive acts of the early 80s released very closely to another great concept album: Camel's Stationary Travellers.5 full stars."

Unlike some bands, these guys take their influence (mainly Genesis) and create something totally unique out of it. The product is something truly amazing, this great piece of work.The album itself consists of several shorter songs that flow into each other pretty much seamlessly. Although they are all practically eighties pop music, one can't help but indulge in the beauty that the band creates. With eighties pop music, mind you, one of my least favorite genres of rock music.When you add Pink Floyd, Gabriel-era Genesis, and Van Der Graaf Generator influences to pop music, this is what you get, an amazing record of emotional brilliance that can be easily played on the radio. What a package!I love each listen, 5 lovely stars.PS Will go more in-depth with an edited review at some point."

          "text": "So this is the highest rated Neo-Prog album? Oh lord. My experience with Neo consists of a Marillion compilation, their album Afraid Of Sunkight and an IQ album. After hearing this, I would have to say if I were forced to live in a Neo-Prog world, I would consider myself an IQ man. I wanted to listen to a full Fish-era Marillion album. I went with this instead of Script because I feared that album would be too Genesis sounding and derivative. Well, there is still lots of Genesis influence here, along with some very 1980s commercial rock influences.This went #1 in the UK and featured two top ten hits. The music on this album is hardly 'prog' at all, instead just slightly adventurous commercial 80s rock. Not until the fourth track do you really hear anything proggy. \"Kayleigh\" was a big hit. Not a bad song but very 80s and very poppy. Instead of sounding like Gabriel, Fish instead sounds like Phil Collins solo during the chorus. Nice mid-80s style guitar solo. \"Lavender\" was the other hit. A piano-based ballad that's nothing special to my ears. Very PG-era Genesis sounding when the rhythm section enters.\"Bitter Suite\" has a cute title. Features narration in a Scottish accent; not sure if Fish is Scottish or not or if he's just acting. Interersting drumming in the middle. The last two or three minutes are good but also very Genesis sounding. \"Heart Of Lothian\" is another Genesis sounding song but doesn't really stand out at all. Three distinct sections in this song. \"Waterhole\" is the track I enjoy the most but it's only 2 minutes long. Almost sounds similar to Gabriel solo musically and Peter Hammill vocally. \"Blind Curve\" rips off the opening chords of the Genesis song \"Dance On A Volcano\" in places. The Scottish narrator is back. It's a long song and it's proggy but nothing really grabs my attention. \"Childhood's End\" is a nifty, very 80s sounding song but it's not prog at all. Almost sounds like 80s Gabriel solo in places.After hearing this album, I think I can conclude that Marillion is not a band for me. I haven't heard anything they did since Afraid Of Sunlight so there might be hope yet. My future explorations into Neo will include groups not as popular as Marillion, in the hope that I hear something not so commercial nor derivative. Marillion are the most popular Neo band for a reason: their music is highly accessible and commercial and not very proggy. I'm going to give this a 2.5 but rounded down to 2 stars. Fans only."

          "text": "Marillion's first concept album might be a slick and occasionally saccharine presentation of their sound, lacking the murky depths of the other three Fish-era albums, but it remains a remarkably competent stab at producing an album-length suite of continuous music in the tradition of Dark Side of the Moon and Thick as a Brick. Sure, Kayleigh and Lavender might have been big commercial hits and aren't particularly proggy, but when placed in context there's an edge to them that's lacking if they're listened to in isolation, and most of the other tracks are significantly more arty - though by and large less complex than the material on Script, Fugazi, or for that matter Clutching at Straws.The only major beef I have with the album is White Feather, which feels like a tacked-on sing-along to provide the album with a good track to close concerts with rather than an organic part of the concept; not only is the transition to it from Childhoods End? awkward, but said preceding track does a better job of providing closure to the concept and bringing things full circle. (It's also just not a very good song). But even taking that into account, this is a decent achievement on Marillion's part; it's my least favourite of the Fish-era albums, but I do like it a lot when I'm in the right mood, and really \"least favourite Fish-era album\" is like saying \"least-favourite masterpiece\"; Marillion did not last long with Fish compared with the long and illustrious career they had with Steve Hogarth, but golly did they make every one of those first four albums count."

Instead, it's largely a flavorless album devoid of spice. While there is nothing inherently wrong with simplicity, the progressions on this album are bland and wholly predictable. Generally, this is not a progressive rock masterpiece (it's hardly progressive rock), but it does contain some very good music, especially to the ear not put off by 1980s rock clich\ufffds, which this album has in spades.\"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" Stark synthesizer providing a simple development sits beneath Fish's unmistakable vocal.\"Kayleigh\" A saccharine pop song, but a strikingly good one and immediately catchy, \"Kayleigh\" is a light bit of fun in the vein of Toto.\"Lavender\" A childlike, sweet follow up to \"Kayleigh,\" this is again unoffending soft rock. The lead guitar consists of a modest but fitting motif.\"Bitter Suite\" Synthesizer and spoken word open this darker song, which primarily consists of Steve Rothery performing another elementary solo.\"Heart of Lothian\" Passionate and patriotic, this is one of the highlights of the album, featuring a splendid counterpoint between the vocal climax and the lead guitar.\"Waterhole (Expresso Bongo)\" The sixth track picks up with some dark energy, but unfortunately doesn't do much with it, preferring to just peter off into the next track.\"Lords of the Backstage\" Vividly bright, this tune is a major contrast to the previous song.\"Blind Curve\" For the most part on this album, Marillion had been sitting comfortably in syrupy pop music, occasionally dipping a toe into the complexities progressive rock is well known for, but here, the band embraces the compositional involvedness that was more evident on an album like their very first one. The ubiquitous clean electric guitar transforms the chord progressions into even more satisfying entities. The piece drops off into a percussive chasm, one that sounds quite like the very beginning of Genesis' \"Back in NYC\" before moving back into simplistic symphonic rock.\"Childhood End?\" Pete Trewavas elevates an otherwise straightforward synth-pop song with compelling bass playing, and Mark Kelley's synthesizer lead concludes the piece wonderfully.\"White Feather\" The closer is a brief, energetic rocker, and little more."

          "text": "MARILLION did something strange on their 3rd album MISPLACED CHILDHOOD. They upped the progressiveness in terms of theme by creating their first concept album that despite being broken up into ten tracks is really two long pieces that flow together. Supposedly based on Fish's acid trip where he had visions of the extremes of life including lost love, sudden success and lost childhood. On the other hand the band decreased the progressiveness and made a more mainstream sounding album in the music department. In fact, do I dare say this sounds like progressive AOR? I certainly don't mean that as an insult because I rather like well developed AOR and it doesn't get any better than the smooth melodic MARILLION magic that is crafted so well on this most successful of their albums. The album is one of the top sellers in their canon and spawned hit singles as well with \"Kayleigh\" hitting the number 2 position on the UK charts.Although MARILLION was accused of blatant Genesis worship from the beginning I find it to be the most true on this album where Fish nails the Gabriel sound more so than on other albums. The swirling synths and guitars bring \"Wind And Wuthering\" to mind and seems like the next logical continuation of that particular sound that they brought back to life. This album is simply a masterpiece of melodic prowess that flows beautifully from beginning to end. I admit that out of the four Fish-era albums that this one is my least favorite but it is one that nevertheless is beautifully constructed in a manner that makes me want to hear it throughout its entirety when I put it on. Liking less is a relative term in which the other surrounding albums are just so outstanding that despite being in fourth place it still deserves the 5 star mark in my world."

          "text": "A deceptionEven after several listens, I still don't understand why this album is often considered as MARILLION's best and as one of the greatest representative of the neo-prog genre. I do enjoy the other studio records from the Fish-era though, but here the music is a bit too consensual. For sure, the band gained more audience by turning more accessible and radio-friendly with this release, making the compositions less progressive and complex, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, despite being the first MARILLION concept album, \"Misplaced Childhood\" is too smooth and do not possess the creativity and the magic of their previous opuses. The evasion and fantasy are still present, but are melted with 80's pop cheesiness.The opener \"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" is a melancholic intro for \"Kayleigh\". This hit single possesses a nice beautiful ambiance, but is ruined by its soapy melody. The poppy commercial \"Lavender\" is also rather boring. The worst track of the record. On the contrary, the progressive \"Bitter Suite\" is one of the best compositions of the disc. It features a spacey introduction, numerous changes and pretty floyd-ian peaceful passages. \"Heart Of Lothian\" is another poppy neo-prog rock song.Then comes the hard oppressive \"Waterhole\", quite surprising with its tribal ambiance. As a transition, \"Lords Of The Backstage\" is forgettable but fortunately short enough to avoid being irritating. The 9 minutes \"Blind Curve\" is the longest and other progressive track, in the style of \"Bitter Suite\". Despite its very nice guitar solo, this composition is average, as it contains lengthy insipid passages. \"Childhoods End?\" is in fact the opposite to \"Kayleigh\": the only good things are the powerful melody and its fantasy finale, typical of the neo-prog genre. Concerning \"White Feather\", this hard FM ender seems rather out of place.\"Misplaced Childhood\" has interesting tracks, but less breathtaking moments than on \"Script for a Jester's Tear\" or \"Fugazi\". The mixture of commercial pop and neo-progressive structures does not work always very well and doesn't provide such evasion as the other previous opus.An overrated album, not the best point to start with to discover neo-prog, especially if you're allergic to 80's FM pop. However, this is still MARILLION with Fish, therefore the result remains overall enjoyable."

          "text": "Misplaced Childhood represents a significant moment in my music listening history. At the age of 14-15 I was listening to the vinyls of my elder sister and brother, Dire Straits being my first favourite band. There were a bunch of prog oriented early 80's albums too, by e.g. Asia, Saga, Rush, Yes and Jon Anderson that I found interesting. At the time I didn't yet buy vinyls myself, I used to tape music on cassettes. And then I saw this band on TV, it was some New Year's night concert featuring many artists - I don't remember who the others were. I do remember the line \"do you remember\" repeated several times, and the singer had some red paint on his face. I purchased Fugazi as my first vinyl and persuaded my friend to get Misplaced Childhood. So begun my most dedicated fandom period of my life, lasting for a couple of years.Since it feels awkward for me to write a review for such heavily reviewed album, I first thought to write one for the 'Kayleigh' single. I'm getting tired of reviewing singles so much, so here's my very subjective view on this famous Neo Prog milestone. I bought it on CD several years later at the early 90's, but it isn't my favourite of the Fish era, that honour goes to Clutching at Straws. And up to this day my reception of Misplaced Childhood is somewhat ambivalent. Like many other prog listeners, I find it a bit cheesy as a whole, with the super-clean production, sugared synth carpets and sentimental guitar solos.'Pseudo Silk Kimono' is irritatingly all cheesy synths, but it functions as a conceptual mood-setter, followed seamlessly by the radio-friendly song for lost love, 'Kayleigh' (which I have as a ringtone on my phone nowadays!), which is seamlessly followed by another radio-friendly love song, naively romantic 'Lavender'. What is this? A potpourri of pop songs? Luckily, 'Bitter Suite' and 'Heart of Lothian' are multi-part compositions with various moods. I love the quietest, more mystified parts (\"A spider wanders aimlessly...\", and later, \"It's getting late for scribbling and scratching on the paper...\") whereas 'Blue Angel' and 'Wide Boy' sections are really cheesy, especially for the guitar solos. On the next album there's a lot more diversity in guitar and keyboard sounds. Is Misplaced Childhood perhaps over-produced in a way, emphasizing the sentimental concept?The album is practically two side-long, pauseless entities, and that's definitley one of its strengths. The second part (side of the vinyl) contains the ultimate highlight, but there are also songs that feel like fillers to me. 'Waterhole (Expresso Bongo)', terribly boring. 'Lords of the Backstage' is refreshingly bold and bright. 'Blind Curve' is a magnificent journey into deep, sore emotions, and finally there's new blood on guitar parts too. The melody in 'Mylo' is spellbinding, and the creepily quiet section 'Perimeter Walk' gives goose bimples. Unfortunately the 'Threshold' section returns to the cheesiness and the similarily wailing guitar solo by numbers heard on the first side. 'Childhoods End?' is a fine, sunny and powerful catharsis after all the dark emotions the concept album has gone through. The synth solo at its end sounds very Genesis-like. But for me 'White Feather' is a boring anti-climax.This is definitely an important album, but the certain weaknesses and the overall cheesiness make me round my 3\ufffd stars downwards. This is not to say I wouldn't understand five-star ratings perfectly well!"

          "text": "Marillion with this Lp record a prog classic with minimal arrangement effort and maximum commercial feedback. \"Misplaced Childhood\" is a concept album that develops as a single suite, and Marillion would have liked to be just a suite like \"Thick As A Brick\", but the record company has imposed them to indicate each song.The first side opens with \"Pseudo Silk Kimono\" (2:13, vote 7+): slow, meditative, based on the keyboards. A good preamble to the second song, the most commercial of the album, \"Kayleigh\" (4:03, vote 7,5/8): strophe, refrain, guitar solo, strophe, refrain. Here are the Marillion: commercial melodic rock, great cleverness, purring sound, with a soft production. The drums have a good, full sound (Ian Mosley); guitar is very fluid, thin, not at all heavy; good bass (Pete Trewavas) and good keyboards; voice like Gabriel's, but more nervous, snappy. No more instruments than the four of the typical rock complex. Production of the album completely homogeneous, arrangements without any real alternative to the guitar solo (Steve Rothery). Yet it works. It works very well!There is nothing really brilliant, innovative, particularly original, such that I can say: this is a new form of art, they have the gift of pure talent. Marillion are very epigonic of Genesis, Yes, Pink Floyd... But they can processed them obtaining an excellent synthesis. Marillion can get the best with the least amount of effort. Because if it's true that they don't have that quid of the gifted, it is equally true that they don't have the typical defects of progressive. In fact, the sound, considering that we are in the mid-eighties, is good, clean but good: it's not muffled, it doesn't have the usual defects of the eighties. The group has no virtuosos, and they doesn't linger in solos: it's the synergy of the instrumentalists that produces the result. This is true team play. The compositions are synthetic, they go straight to the point, with excellent progressions, without wandering, without getting lost in the cerebral masturbations in which many bands are forwarded when they prolong dramatically a song with endless variations on the theme. Marillion put a lot of meat into the fire, don't digress, and with a purring sound, express emotions through music, voice and lyrics. For example, the transition lines on the piano (Mark Kelly) between \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\" (2:27, vote 8,5) by itself is much more inspired than entire records of some symphonic rock groups (I don't name them!). Lavender's progression with its epic melody reaches climax, and represents the highest point on the album. Too bad that Lavender ends after only two and a half minutes: they had to prolong it another minute, as they did with the single record!They sacrificed the song for the suite, in fact Lavender fades into the recited suite (\"Bitter Suite\", 5:53; Vote 7,5/8), which creates a variation at the usual rhythm punctuated by drums, vocals, guitar solos. But here, after the recitative, the rhythm returns and the guitar plays again the Lavender melody. Finally, the rhythm changes, there are some excellent instrumental passages, the voice of Fish is not beautiful but it's very expressive, the singer knows how to do it, puts his heart (and we feel it!), it's not the cool virtuosic song of some prog groups, here we are close to classic rock given the synthetic capacity of the composition, the classic arrangement and the pathos transmitted. And so we approach \"Heart of Lothian\" (6:02, vote 8+), with a very evocative progression, which then flows back into the epic mood, touching another climax, yes, \"I was born with a Heart of Lothian\", sings Fish, with an anthem rhythm that would be an exceptional stadium song. And in fading the first side closes. Great. Short, inspired, pimp, catchy, yet without tricks, without overdoing, direct. They know how to do it, they will not be geniuses, but they can compose music of excellent quality, and play it and interpret it with the heart, obtaining great pathos. Vote side A: 9.The second side is slightly smaller, more homogeneous, more rhythmic and less melodic, based on a long central piece. The first two short pieces (Waterhole -Expresso Bongo- 2:12; Lords Of The Backstage -1:52; vote 7,5) are the same song with a change of rhythm, the drums are always present, sometimes they may be slightly lumpy, but the voice of Fish and the guitar by Rothery act as a counterpoint, and so we get to \"Blind Curve\" (9:29; vote 8+) that towards half stops the beating on the snare to make room for a guitar phrasing that echoes to create an evocative atmosphere where finally the voice of Fish in one of his dramatic \"crescendo\" finally arrives at the climax (the only one on the second side), asking, desperate to have his childhood back, childhood that he can not find anymore. Then the rhythm starts again, and Blind Cruve end playing again the epic Lothian melody by guitar; then Rothery intones another rhythm, always very strong, as in all the second side, to propose another classic rock song, \"Childhood's End?\" (4:32) which has a good crescendo, even if it doesn't reach the climax.The last piece (\"White Feather\"; 2:23, vote 7), as indeed the last fading movement of Heart of Lothian, is not particularly significant, it is functional to the text. Vote side B: 8,5.So this short album closes, which runs away perhaps too quickly but without a weak moment. The fact is that you listen with pleasure, without effort, and never get bored, despite you find always the same arrangements. I bought this record when it came out, in 1985, I was a teenager, and sounded hypnotized by Lavender, Heart of Lothian and Kayleigh: I liked the record right away, that melodic rock punctuated by a pulsating drums, a gritty voice and solos guitar was immediately addictive to me, I really felt the epic of the moment. The second side has no successful singles like the first, it is less varied, but holds well. It is a miracle how they can achieve such high results without doing anything truly original, but the beauty of this music consists precisely in its usability, in the synergy that is created between the melody and the sound of the group. So, what rating to give? It would be more a four and a half stars that a five- stars, because the vote would be more an 8.5 / 9 than a 9 (in my particular ranking the 5 stars start from the vote 9). But I see the representation of Marillion for neo-prog and I see the pleasure I have listening to this album, soI give vote album 9. Rating: Five Stars."

          "text": "Review N\ufffd 261'Misplaced Childhood' is the third studio album of Marillion and was released in 1985. With its lush production and mix, this album became the greatest commercial triumph of the band, especially in Europe where the group raised the peak of their fame and became known as one of the most famous progressive rock bands in the world. It was also their most commercially successful album, reaching the first position in the U.K. charts and spending a total of forty one weeks on the chart, the longest chart residency that a Marillion's album ever got. It was also a very successful album in U.S.A. The band even made a tour with Rush as a support act. In short, this was really a truly successful album, really.The album featured also the most successful single of the group, 'Kayleigh', which reached the second position in the list of the most commonly listen in U.K. and was a worldwide success too. The name of the song was conceived by Fish slightly disguising the name of an old girlfriend of him, Kay Lee, on which the song was inspired. 'Lavender' was another song that was also released as a single and it was also a great commercial success. It reached the fifth position on the chart. Much of the song titles contain autobiographical references. For example, 'Kayleigh', as I said before, and 'Heart Of Lothian', an explicit reference to a traditional region of Scotland, in Edinburgh, where Fish was born.'Misplaced Childhood' is a conceptual album, the first conceptual album released by the group, consisting of a continuous piece of music. Armed with a handful of lyrics born out of a self confessed acid trip, during 10 hours after consuming LSD, Fish came up with this very well elaborated concept for the album. The story of the album is essentially about lost loves, sudden success, acceptance, lost childhood and it has surprisingly an upbeat ending.The line up on the album is Derek Dick 'Fish' (vocals), Steve Rothery (guitars), Mark Kelly (keyboards), Pete Trewavas (bass) and Ian Mosley (drums).'Misplaced Childhood' has ten tracks. Because this is a conceptual album, the music moves and flows continuously. The music is very fragmented. Most songs consist of short themes tied together in a remarkable way. The lyrics are even more fragmented and because of the personal nature they're pretty difficult to interpret. 'Pseudo Silk Kimono' is a short introduction to the album. Mellow synthesiser tones, a warm bass and a guitar hinting in the back, that's all that accompanies Fish's soft whispering voice. As the synth tones of 'Pseudo Silk Kimono' fades, the guitar intro to 'Kayleigh' starts. The lyrics for the song were considered too much personal by the band. This is a classic prog ballad, a sad invocation for regret and self blame. A piano segue connects 'Kayleigh' and 'Lavender'. This is one of the most original songs in prog rock history combining a traditional English nursery rhyme with classic rock components. It's magically transformed into a touching love song where the sentiment of beauty is masterfully captured. 'Bitter Suite' is one of the lengthiest and more complex songs on the album. This very fragmented song starts with a very ambiguous little poem. It's brooding and dramatic, with multiple sections and with a very beautiful piano ending. 'Heart Of Lothian' was the last song chosen to be released as a single. It's a pretty straightforward rock song. The lyrics are about Fish's nationalism, proud to be a Scots. It's catchy and irresistible. It has cohesive keyboards and drums, catchy guitar riffs, strong bass lines and Fish's dramatic voice. 'Waterhole (Expresso Bongo)' is very aggressive, lyrically and musically. It starts with menacing keyboard tones before drums kick in and a high paced rock song full of percussion. 'Lords Of The Backstage' is another high paced rock song. This song deals about the poor combination of love and life on the road. The music quietens again for the epic on the album, 'Blind Curve'. It's again a very fragmented song like 'Bitter Suite'. Rothery takes over with one of the most beautiful guitar solos. 'Childhood's End' is a sweet song. Trewavas playing is superb, keyboards also make an important part for the song and the strumming playing of Rothery's guitar would become his trademark for years. 'White Feather' is a great song to close the album, very energetic and dynamic.Conclusion: Besides be their most commercially successful album, 'Misplaced Childhood' is, for me and without any doubt, their best studio album until today, and is also, in my humble opinion, one of the best studio albums ever made in the progressive rock music. Even the former drummer of Dream Theater, Mike Portnoy commented that this was the best Marillion's album of all time. With 'Misplaced Childhood', Marillion proved they weren't a clone of Genesis and with it they reached the status of be considered one of the best progressive rock bands ever. 'Misplaced Childhood', put Marillion on the same quality level of Genesis, Yes, Pink Floyd, Gentle Giant, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Van Der Graaf Generator, Camel, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rush and Dream Theater. It put them as one of the greatest and most influential prog bands of ever too. If you don't know the band yet and want to buy a Marillion's albums, this is the best.Prog is my Ferrari.

          "text": "Misplaced Chilodhood is one of those albums in which it seems that everything a group wants to transmit, it achieves from start to finish in a sequence of songs that maintains a level that does not decline, and the pauses that are few, only serve to take a bit of air and continue on the journey that these neoprogressive giants invite us to take. In my opinion, the highest point of the album is located in the sequence that goes from Lavander, going through Bitter Suite and finally Heart of Lothian, which incidentally marks the end of side A. Probably Kayleigh, is the best-known song by Marillion by all, and in fact it is excellent, but I think the previous 3 are one step up. Excellent guitar playing by Steve Rothery, with a smooth and velvety style, as well as intense and deep, which marked the neoprogressive genre onwards, the Mark Kelly keyboards that I consider were its highest point, and the excellent vocal performance of Fish , proud adoptive son of Peter Gabriel. The genre had a before and after, marked by this album, from it a whole new current was generated that still flourishes today."

          "text": "It is on 1985's 'Misplaced Childhood' that Marillion truly saw the stars line up, the former becoming their breakthrough album, a success both commercially and creatively, though some might argue that the band has released stronger and more coherent records after that What is certain is that 'Misplaced Childhood' saw this inevitable maturation of the neo-prog giants and skyrocketed them into the realm of the mainstream. Gone are the days of the gothic undertones, for what concerns the music, of course, as the strikingly vivid and profound lyrics of Fish only seem to be getting better with every release. The same could be said about his vocal performances, too. In a successful and compelling crafting of a more recognizable identity, while armed with a new produced, Marillion seem to shake off the symbolic dust of classic prog, as this album has an explicitly more accessible and streamlined sounds than its two predecessors, producing three fantastic singles, one of which a super-hit.Does not the jester escaping from the window on the back side of the album's sleeve depict precisely this shift in the band's sound, this maturation that sees them embrace a much more authentic artistic presentation? A loose concept album focusing on Fish's childhood, the band finally let the songs flow into one another and manage to put out quite a concise and straightforward album, much in the vein of the classic rock albums of the previous decade. Heavily leaning towards being a very exemplary pop album, this is the record that finally sees Marillion embracing a more outstretched palette of influences. Staying true to their own style, however, the uplifting poetry of the words to the songs navigates the listener on a memorable sonic journey all throughout. The record does suffer a little bit from the hits overshadowing the other shorter songs, but the two longer pieces are great, with 'Bitter Suite' being especially good. A very important album that had put Marillion on another level."

Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "genre": "Neo-Prog",
      "country": "United Kingdom",
      "biography": "Formed in 1979 in Aylesbury, UK (as Silmarillion, after the Tolkien novel) - Still active as of 2019\n\nPioneers of the second wave of progressive rock\n\nThe Early Years\n\nAfter some early line-up changes, the first recognisable incarnation of the band was complete by 1982, with\n\nFISH\n\n(real name Derek William Dick), a charismatic Scottish frontman vocalist,\n\nSteve ROTHERY\n\non guitars, Peter Trewavas on bass, Mark Kelly on keyboards, and Mick Pointer on drums.\n\nThe band built their reputation the old-fashioned way by gigging extensively, but their profile was also raised by some clever manipulation of the music press, especially journals such as Sounds, in which Fish often interviewed his proposition that the band were \"prog with attitude\", a new force for the post-punk era.\n\nThis profile landed them a record deal with EMI records, and, in 1982, they released an EP Market Square Heroes, which, it is fair to say, had more than a passing resemblance to the Genesis classic, The Knife. Also appearing was a monster prog track called Grendel.\n\nHowever, it was the release in 1983 of their debut long player, Script For A Jester's Tear, which brought them to the wider attention of the rock world. The album spawned hit singles in Garden Party and He Knows You Know, was critically well received, and reached number 7 in the UK album charts.\n\nThe band's progress and workload were relentless after this point. They proved themselves to be somewhat merciless in the pursuit of musical and commercial success by ditching Pointer, who was felt to be sub-standard, and replacing him eventually with, after what the band described as their \"Spinal Tap\" period for drumming, Ian Mosley, formerly of The Steve Hackett Band. Pointer went on to jointly form Arena, a classic neo outfit who still record today, and still tours his Script era version of Marillion. The difference Mosley made, though, both live and in the studio, was palpable.\n\nThe line-up released three more albums; Fugazi, Misplaced Childhood, and, finally Clutching At Straws.\n\nMisplaced Childhood was a massive hit, reaching number 1 in the UK charts in 1985, and responsible for huge hit singles in Kayleigh, Lavender, and Heart of Lothian. By this time, Fish had ditched his trademark face paint, - the music and his sheer personality were a tour de force in themselves, with no need any longer for gimmicks or theatrics. This spell of activity culminated in a huge open-air gig in front of tens of thousands at Milton Keynes Bowl, supported by, amongst others, Jethro Tull, themselves no strangers to large concerts.\n\nClutching At Straws was released in 1987, and was an altogether darker affair, inspired by colossal drink and drug use by Fish, in particular, and discussing the many complex personal issues that brought. The relentless touring continued, and EMI were eager for the band to release a quick follow up. The pressure of this was too much, and in 1988, Fish left the band to embark on a solo career which, it is fair to say, had mixed success.\n\nThe Hogarth Years\n\nFor many acts, losing such a charismatic and important frontman and lyricist would spell the death knell. Not, however, for Marillion.\n\nIn 1989, they announced to the world that\n\nSteve HOGARTH\n\n, a vocalist formerly with little known The Europeans, would be Fish's replacement. It is a little-known irony that Fish, when appearing on a BBC personality programme discussing his favourite music tracks, had actually played a Europeans single whilst still with Marillion.\n\nIt is a testament to this inspired choice that the band have recorded and toured constantly, with latterly increasing success again, with the self-same line-up for (at the time of updating this biography) 28 years, an incredible achievement.\n\nThe debut album released by the line-up was Season's End, released in 1989. Much of the music had been recorded prior to Hogarth's arrival, and it showed. It charted, though, at a respectable number 7 in the UK.\n\nThe follow up, Holidays in Eden, was, perhaps understandably, criticised by fans and the press alike, as a misplaced attempt to create a commercial rock album driven by the desire to have hits. Whilst it did not bomb, also reaching number 7 in the charts, it certainly did not sell in the numbers of its predecessors, and the band found themselves playing to (admittedly ultra-loyal fans attending) mid-size venues of 3,000 such as Wolverhampton Civic Hall, rather than the larger arenas of the late Fish era.\n\nThe band fought back, though, releasing in 1994 (three years after Holidays) the seminal concept album, Brave. The lyrics behind the music were inspired by a story Hogarth heard on local radio concerning a young lady who had committed suicide by leaping from Bristol Suspension Bridge. Although obviously dark and brooding almost throughout, the album was a statement of intent by a band determined to plough their own furrow in the music world. In later years, the album has been critically praised, and it also spawned a rather arty film of the same name.\n\nEMI, though, dropped the band, and the final album released with the label at the time was Afraid of Sunlight, released in 1995. It only reached number 16 in the UK charts, and sold relatively poorly. It was not much compensation when, upon reviewing the album on release, Q Magazine pronounced boldly that if any other band than Marillion had released this work, it would be a monster hit worldwide. At this time, prog had a bad name again, and the band suffered because of it. Further, more than one member of the band has wondered what would have been had they renamed themselves upon Hogarth's joining. There has been some wonderful recognition of the storytelling and emotional music inherent in the album when the family of Donald Campbell, famously killed in an accident on Coniston Water in a speed record attempt, following the discovery of his body in 2001, asked the band to perform Out of this World, a track from the album inspired by Campbell, at a memorial service.\n\nMarillion signed for Castle Records, and went on to record three albums with them, these being This Strange Engine, Radiation, and Marillion.com. The band, though, became increasingly unhappy with the poor marketing strategy, and lack of understanding of the music, by their record company, and they parted ways, with no real prospect of a new deal anywhere else in prospect. Once again, the band found themselves on the cusp of disaster.\n\nDisaster was averted, as Marillion set the template for all the crowd funded, internet based, music recording that is so widespread in the second decade of the millennium. Put simply, they asked their fans, still incredibly loyal, to fund the recording of Anoraknophobia before even a note had been recorded. 12,000 fans responded, EMI agreed to distribute it, and survival, on the band's terms, was ensured. This incredibly far sighted decision was not just the beginning of a return to relative commercial success, but also the template for many other more niche acts to follow.\n\nMarbles, released in 2004, a very well received album with genuine classic progressive tracks, had its marketing funded by the fans, but also had a double cd not commercially available to those who pre-ordered. Again, it was a tremendous success, and the band even enjoyed a return to the top ten singles charts with You're Gone, even if an appearance on Top of the Pops was denied them.\n\nAt the time of writing this biography in 2017, the band have released five more albums, all with increasing commercial success, and continuing to use the fanbase as the model for funds and publicity, together with a more sympathetic press tiring of overtly rubbish commercial pop music. In 2016, the album F.E.A.R. (the acronym being f**k Everyone And Run) was released to large critical acclaim, and marked a return to overtly political lyrics and anger not really witnessed since the halcyon days of Fish ranting against war and Thatcherism in equal measure. It caught the zeitgeist of the times extremely well, that of a tired world increasingly bewildered by greed, corruption, poverty, the loss of traditional England, and an inability by the country's (and world's) politicians to deal with such issues effectively. It peaked at number 4 in the UK charts, having been funded by a Pledge Music campaign, and in October 2017 the band achieved a lifetime ambition of playing live at London's Royal Albert Hall. Tickets sold out within three minutes of being on sale.\n\nMarillion can be said to epitomise the tradition of progressive rock, playing, at times, incredibly complex music, but with an attitude and ethos wholly grounded alongside their fanatical fanbase. People reading this biography should not be fooled, or put off, by the neo-prog label attributed to them on this site. Marillion are far more than that, and they proclaim it very proudly.\n\nSteve Lazenby (Lazland) - 2017",

          "text": "Permanent Waves reminds me of the snow storms I used to experience when I first heard it in the frozen cold of an Upper Michigan winter. Spirit of Radio and Freewill were radio staples at the time, but Jacob's Ladder was the soundtrak to the huge, dark, snow engorged storm clouds of the winter. The throbbing bass line chugged in a JAWS like menacing pulse. Natural Science, my favorite track, rivals any \"epic\" prog out there, from King Crimson to Yes. It's got some of the best lyrics written. By far their best musical display. Muscular and melodic.Permanent Waves will always be my favorite Rush album simply because it is connected to me in a special way."

          "text": "This is when the early fans started to wonder why a band commits Hara-Kiri, as the sound had changed drastically. We all had to admit that Geddy Lee could not go on screaming like the madman he appeared to non-fans so he had to change his singing for his own throat's sake. But did they have to change their music so much? As history will point out , they were right because every album brought new fans even though the older ones were bemused.Only two tracks can be likened to the previous Hemispheres, and this would be the cool and rather calm Jacob's Ladder clearly a highlight and the three part mini-suite Natural Science (especially the last movement) being the other climax.the rest of the tracks were either meant at radio airplay (Spirit of Radio - In Toronto this meant 102.1 FM) or filler such as Entre Nous. A rather uneven and transitional album."

          "text": "Oh dear! After the promise of the previous two excellent studio albums, this one marked, for me, the first major change in direction, and not one I enjoyed much. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad album, and Jacob's Ladder and Freewill are Rush classics, and rightfully so. But the rest of the album seems thin,and to lack ideas. The Spirit Of Radio is far too jolly and insignificant, and the other tracks are forgettable. (Although the end of Different Strings has some nice fade out guitar work. Vies with 2112 as the second or third weakest album they have done. (Of course, both are superior to the tragic Fly By Night!) Only for die-hard fans."

          "text": "Compared to \"Hemispheres\", this record is just a bit less progressive, being quite complex rythmic hard rock. The electric guitar has a bit less of the overdrive effect than on the \"Hemispheres\" album. The keyboards are very simple and are rather in the background, and they do not take very much room. On the catchy \"Spirit of the Radio\", there is a pleasant reggae part, and you can hear a rythmic PIANO on the song. \"Free Will\" has an OUTSTANDING complex bass part. \"Different Strings\" is a more mellow track full of melodic acoustic guitar, PIANO and relaxing lead vocals, ending with a slow & moaning guitar solo. The last track, \"Natural Science\", is one of the best RUSH track ever recorded: it is very progressive, structured and it has varied themes; the instruments, especially the bass and drums, are very complex. This record, coming right before \"Moving Pictures\", announces a bit how the lead guitar will sound like.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

          "text": "Where earlier RUSH albums escaped into a fantasy world of their own devising, \"Permanent Waves\" unlocks the magic from within. It marked a turning point in RUSH's fortunes as they traded in fantasy for reality, diffusive energy for a concentrated beam of brilliance, bygone battles for imminent conflicts. I've never approached \"Permanent Waves\" as a concept album, though on reflection it usually occurs to me that \"Spirit of Radio\" presents a problem (where's the integrity in art?) that \"Natural Science\" offers a solution for (the honest shall inherit the earth and bring art and science under the command of good). And many of the songs are philosophical musings painted in epic detail: \"Entre Nous\" offers the epigrammatic insight that \"The spaces in between leave room for you and I to grow\", \"Free Will\" notes that \"If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice.\" Really, you'd have to look back to GRATEFUL DEAD's ROBERT HUNTER to find that much life wisdom delivered so succintly in a rock song. But the real wonder of \"Permanent Waves\" is the music, tighter than ever, not bloated with majesty but elevated by it, ascending toward some higher purpose. \"The Spirit of Radio\" is a bracing beginning that plays out like a life-or-death battle for integrity. \"Free Will\" puts the power back in the lap of the listener, lest RUSH sound too preachy. On the lyrical surface, \"Jacob's Ladder\" is no more than an extended haiku, but musically. good gracious! ALEX LIFESON's guitar pierces through like nothing since STEVE HOWE, sublime in its effect, and the whole song could be seen as an equal to the secret wonders of \"Fragile\": \"Heart of the Sunrise\" and \"South Side of the Sky.\" This first side of music, in my opinion, ranks as one of the greatest \"Sides\" of plastic in all progdom. \"Entre Nous\" marks the entrance to side two, another classic RUSH track infused with the same warm humanity as \"Closer To The Heart.\" A reference to the band's change in direction would seem to occur on \"Different Strings\", which resurrects some of the old sound (shrouded in mist) and imagery (one could interpret \"slaying the dragon\" as an end to the fantasy-fueled epics of old). The three-part \"Natural Science\" finds NEIL PEART seeking in science a fertile allegory for life (and succeeding), themes that would continue on Moving Pictures and (especially) \"Signals\". From this point on the Future would be RUSH's future, as their heroes put away their swords (their dragons now extinct), entered the battlefield of business, charged the gates of digital domains, and sought personal connections in an increasingly impersonal world. Just between us, it gave them a whole new world in which to grow. Collector's note: It appears only the original Anthem issue features the headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" on the newspaper blowing in the front cover foreground; subsequent issues have the newspaper title whited out (a la BILLY RIPKEN)."

          "text": "6... Yes, six great reasons to own this record. I know my Rush, and this one's a keeper. A different approach but the same comforting warmth. Rush knows what the're doing. For them, 1980 was a great year. They made a solid statement with duo Farewell/Hemispheres and now, they headed for new lands. But they brought luggage. That's what cool with Rush, the changes are made not drastically. They give you time to breathe and acclimate with their art. Great way to keep the ones you love close to you. That includes me. I still see myself listening that wonderful record in high school, in my crappy Sanyo walkman. I didn't even had it on cd. Except for Jacob's Ladder (a real treat), the whole album is positive and upright. Peart's lyrics are talking about understanding and emotional movement. Yay! And the album ends up with a song that aged so well, it's almost unbeleivable it was written 24 years ago: 'Natural Science'. For those who heard it live, it's a perfect 10 in 10 minutes. Rush really got forward in accesible songwriting and performance. A great place to start for the Rush middle-period. A perfect blend or light prog and rock. This album cannot deceive you. It would be illogical when everything falls into place in such a perfect precision. Welcome in the 80's...but in the right way. * 5 EXCEPTIONNAL STARS *"

          "text": "It's a new RUSH! Well, not really- the excellent \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Natural Science\" give us some continuity with the hard progressive rock, but the accessible immediacy of the songs on this album marks the band's dedication to making their epics more concise and refined. \"Spirit of Radio\" is the most direct song they've done, focusing on the music business the same critical eye they utilized on tracks like \"2112\" and \"A Farewell to Kings\"- and ironically becomes their most succesful hit (at that point). Likewise, \"Freewill\" sees Peart refining his songcraft and philosophical leanings, and \"Entre Nous\" brings more emotional depth to a band which had, at best, 'uncomplicated' romantic compositions. \"Different Strings\" is even more telling a glimpse- we see the maturity and sense of loss that will take over on \"Signals\" and \"Grace Under Pressure\". It almost goes without saying that the musicianship is remarkable; they rose to the challenge of fitting their instrumental discipline to the tighter tracks, and still managed to break new ground along the way. Second only to \"Moving Pictures\" as the band's most effective song-driven album, this one is a great introduction to RUSH and full of wonderful moments. 1980-81 is definitely the time when the RUSH star shone brightest."

          "text": "Well an ever-green like this \"Permanent Waves\" by Rush (even though in a few circumstances for me it should deserve an inferior score in comparison to albums like \"Farewell to Kings\" or \"Hemisphere\") , by considering also the opportunity for them to come back on stage in Europe (first time in Italy) on next Autumn 2004,is giving me the opportunity to talk about this successful album in the future. \"Permanent Waves\" contains the direct song (almost mainstream) \"Spirit of the Radio\", which is very \"radio-friendly\", but with a fantastic intro by Neal Peart on drums, being exceptionally and easily supported too, by means of the powerful guitar of Alex Lifeson;nevertheless you can listen also to some other progressive \"jewels\" , such as \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Freewill\", which are well worth checking out once again... such an interesting use of mini-moog, fine guitar solos within, as well as a rhythmical and syncopated bass line, which is moreover enriched with an irregular time signature!!Instead Rush nowadays is not able to reproduce such grandeur, but you can recognize the attempt to make another music renewal, regarding of their several music ideas, especially during the long music \"excursus\" of their career. I don't know whether it's enough or not, but for sure, coming back to the present issue, I appreciate the melodic impact of \"Natural Science\" and the clever breaks-through inside \"Entre nous\".... not completely essential, but probably it's the most important work by Rush, who tried in the early eighties to let the crowd know their complex music, passing through the accessible music features within \"Spirit of the Radio\" and introducing the common listener to the progressive elements in a \"gentle\" manner...Clever guys!!!"

OK Permanent Waves marked a move from long epic tracks like on Hemispheres and 2112 but it is filled with such wicked tracks I find that there is more a stubborness to change from some reviews rather than a genuine dislike to the music content.' Spirit of the Radio' encapsulates what short Rush songs are all about and Jacob's Ladder builds to be epic in it's own unique way. \" different Strings' has to be one of Rush's most beautiful slow moving songs and ' Natural science' began the epic last track series which was evident on much of the 80's albums."

Musicianship as ever is superb, and the music inspirational. 'The spirit of Radio' still makes me smile, and glow with annoying optimism and positivity even these days. If anyone ever doubted this bands musical prowess they should listern carefully to 'Freewill' Here we see all three of them exploding in an exciting frenzy of musical wizadry, the likes of which I cant recall hearing on any other album by any other band. 'Jacobs Ladder' is one of two more lengthy conceptual tracks on PW. It brims over with moody time signature changes, and perfectly conjures up the intensity felt before, during and after the mother of all storms. 'Entre Nous' is a bit weak, I always skip it, and I rarely skip Rsh tracks. The only reason I refuse to give this album less than five stars, is the classic and flawless nature of everything else on it. This album is a classic rock album and should be recognised as such. 'Natural Science' is one of Rush's best lengthy tracks, and has to be heard live to be believed.This is an album for lovers of excellent, heartfelt, brilliantly performed music."

          "text": "A couple of things are clear about the Rush that recorded \"Permanent Waves\". One, that the trio is less interested in epic themes, while keeping and even reaffirming a noticeable epic attitude instrumentally (more Oberheim stuff comes to the synthesizer fold). The other, that the threesome are beginning to partially flirt with the AOR format, while still maintaining a penchant for complex rhythm patterns and clever tempo shifts. Gone are the sci-fi splendorous tales, but in turn, the revealing dreams of a prophet ('Jacob's Ladder') and the critical views about the system as a vehicle if oppression against the individual ('Natural Science') become the conceptual vehicles for Peart's lucid concerns and cerebral poetry. This serious stuff is perfectly complemented by great musical ideas, which are enhanced by the musicians' tight performances - this results into both tracks being the most prominent in the album's repertoire. But the remaining tracks are nothing to be dismissed, despite the fact that they obviously are not as aesthetically rewarding for the average prog rock listener. The opener 'Spirit of Radio' is one of those classics that never leave the tracklists on every Rush tour: and no surprise about it, since it's a very catchy number, and at the same time, an effective sample of the prototypical combination of complexity and electric energy that has become a trademark of Rush. 'Free Will' and 'Entre Nous' deal with the individual's affirmation and romantic relationships on the rocks, respectively, with a more AOR-ish attitude, that's true, but never getting rampantly accessible: on the contrary, these numbers comprise that flame of inventiveness in its melodic lines and the instrumental interludes that keeps them from being mere radio friendly simple tunes. The ballad 'Different Strings' is one of the most intimately moving pieces that Rush has written during their 77-81 era, and it might as well be extended a bit longer in order to convey the melancholy proclaimed in its lyrics in a more effective manner - Lifeson's solo in the song's closing section is captivating, but it feels so short when the fade-out appears to call it quits. Fortunately, there's still the epic closure 'Natural Science', whose magnificent grandeur has been described before in this review. Overall conclusion: an excellent progressive album."

          "text": "\"The Spirit of the Radio\" was the first song that I heard from RUSH in 1981, and at that time I didn`t like it because it didn`t have enough keyboards and it sounded to me as \"pure Heavy-Metal\", not as \"Traditional Progressive Rock WITH Keyboards\". At that time, GENESIS and YES were \"the True Prog Bands\" for me because they used more keyboards and \"less distorted Heavy Metal guitars\". By 1983, I listened to RUSH`s live albums \"Exit ...Stage Left\" and \"All the World`s a Stage\", and I changed my opinion about RUSH. So, in 1984, I finally listened to this \"Permanent Waves\" album. As I still prefer the live versions of \"The Spirit of the Radio\", \"Free Will\" and \"Jacob`s Ladder\" from the \"Exit...\" album, my favourite songs in this album are the songs of the Side Two of the L.P.: \"Entre Nous\", \"Different Strings\" (great song!) and the best of all, \"Natural Science\", the most progressive of all. In those years, Neal Peart really impressed me very much, as I still was learning how to play the drums (I began to play the drums in a band in 1981, but I played the drums for the first time in 1977) and I was trying to learn something from the albums that I liked and from drummers that I considered very good drummers. Peart is still a very good drummer, with a very original style which is Progressive and Heavy at the same time.This is a very good album, and I could really recommend it as a starting point for new listeners of this band."

          "text": "The album begins with the sound of guitar pull-offs sweeping across the soundscape soon to be joined by bass and drums. The opening track \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d is an anthem to the powerful force of the radio and the music industry. In keeping with this theme, most of the album \"Permanent Waves\" is very radio friendly. With the exception of \"Jacob \u2019s Ladder\" and \"Natural Science\", the songs here are of radio length: around 4 minutes or so. Two of Rush\u2019s most popular songs came from this album. The aforementioned \u201cSpirit of Radio\u201d and \u201cFreewill\u201d still receive radio air time.At this point in their career, Rush was slowly phasing away from the progressiveness of previous works like \u201c2112\u201d and \u201cHemispheres\u201d. This is not to say the material here is not progressive, in fact, this is a great album for those that want to hear two different sides of Rush: The longer epic side, and the shorter, more accessible side. Even in the shorter songs, there is an element of experimentation. For instance, in \u201cSpirit of Radio\u201d, near the end the song goes into an unexpected reggae-like bridge section before hitting the guitar solo. A few albums later, they began to add more of the reggae riffs into their sound (Vital Signs and Digital Man being good examples).For those that like longer, more experimental songs, Permanent Waves has a lot to offer. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not a huge fan of \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d, however the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me. It\u2019s a seven minute, mostly instrumental song. After an ominous beginning with lyrics about \u201cclouds preparing for battle\u201d, the song goes into a lengthy mid section. Here is where the \u201cshort song\u201d crowd will likely tune out. The riffs here have a military march feel to them, very fitting of the previous lyrics. Some synth later comes in, along with Geddy\u2019s vocals shaped into a robotic voice. The guitar returns, slowly growing louder and building up to a loud climax. I can see why some could see this as a boring song, as I used to think that way before, but there\u2019s a lot here that is heard only after a few extra listens.The big, epic track of the album is \u201cNatural Science\u201d. This is an excellent track and is definitely the highlight of the album. Not only is the concept here noteworthy, the music and atmosphere created as so fitting of its title. It begins gently with the sounds of waves hitting a beach. In comes an acoustic guitar with some reverb added on, making it sound as if he\u2019s playing it on a deserted beach somewhere. Right as the first set of lyrics is finished; the sounds of seagulls can be heard in the background. Pretty cool. There\u2019s some rich visual imagery here in the lyrics. For example: \u201cWheels within wheels, in a spiral array, a pattern so grand and complex, Time after time we lose sight of the way, Our causes can\u2019t see their effect.\u201d Add to that more strange vocals effects during the \u201cHyperspace\u201d section and you\u2019ve got a song that\u2019s full of interesting twists. It\u2019s a shame that this was one of Rush\u2019s last \u201cepic\u201d songs.So putting this all together, there\u2019s a good mix of shorter, accessible songs, and longer more complex ones. Rush may have gotten more radio friendly at this point, but they still had the artist integrity and the brains to come up with some great progressive rock songs. Permanent Waves is a fine album, another classic milestone in Rush's catalogue. They went even further with the monumental \"Moving Pictures\", their crowning achivement and pinnacle.album rating: 9.5/10 points = 96 % on MPV scale = 5/5 starspoint-system: 0 - 3 points = 1 star / 3.5 - 5.5 points = 2 stars / 6 - 7 points = 3 stars / 7.5 - 8.5 points = 4 stars / 9 - 10 points = 5 stars"

The opening track \"Spirit of The Radio\" is well composed and produced, but somehow I found it a bit disappointing after their mid-seventies material. The next song \"Freewill\" is similar in style, but it has nicer parts in it, and Peart's lyrics are thoughtful. \"Jacob's Ladder\" is the other proggy tune on this one along with \"Natural Science\", the later one being my favorite.

This album was one of the first ever to be released in the 80's, coming out on January 1, 1980. The keyboards on this album are more for background purposes, and not to be used in the forefront like in the follow-up albums. Alex's guitar tone on this is immaculate, like all of the tones he uses. Geddy's bass is very complex and he's playing at his creative best, the same with Neil Peart, who pulls out all of the stops. The lyrics on this album are also second to none.The album opens with a fan-favorite The Spirit of Radio. Beginning with a very hard rock intro, it quickly evolves into classic Rush structure. Geddy plays a mean bass, and Neil creates nice sounds with his bells set. The Reggae section is also a very welcome addition to the Rush sound. Freewill also begins in a rocking fashion. This is a very complex song that has multiple time signature changes, and features one of the best Lifeson guitar solos around. The next song, my personal favorite Rush song right now, is one of the most complex songs they ever crafted. I like to call it the Can-Utility and the Coastliners of Rush songs. Jacob's Ladder is a lyrically short piece, but a musically long piece. Featuring shifting signatures every measure, incredible instrumental sections, and and incredible keyboard by Lee, this song just never gets old. The variety in riffs and structure on this song are incredible. The next two pieces, Entre Nous and Different Strings are both quieter, more gentle pieces. Nothing much to say except Hugh Syme plays a great piano of Different Strings. The finale of the album is another personal favorite, the epic Natural Science. With an incredible introduction, the riff-maestro Lifeson never ceases to lose his creative juices. Each section has it's high points, and they all connect to create a masterpiece of a song.Overall, I think this album is one of the best Rush albums ever. There are no flaws, and it never gets old. I recommend this to any progressive rock fan. 5/5."

I think for those of you who were there when this album was released would definitely connect with the past when this album is spun or you hear the opening track. But last weekend, it was not a good thing happened to me and some classic rockers in my country as the only classic rock radio which has been around us for the last ten years has now completely died. That was the formal news I read in Koran Tempo newspaper where the journalist put the above heading (taken from Rush \"Spirit of The Radio\") to start his article. Yes, for years already the station quite often start the day with this song to energize the listeners with an energetic and dynamic song composed and performed by RUSH. Spirit of The Radio has been a \"national\" hit in my country in early eighties altogether with \"Tom Sawyer\" from Moving Picture album. That news have triggered me to spin the CD for the sake of great memory and a token for the dead of classic rock radio. Luckily, there is a new radio coming out: \"Jakarta Alternative Station\" that focuses on classic prog and rock . So.. the spirit carries on .This album of Rush is truly solid in composition and energetic in spirit even with the track that starts mellow like \"Jacob's Ladder\". My all-time favorite track from this album is \"Natural Science\". I especially like the hard-edge guitar work and riffs combined with dazzling drums. The changing styles also what makes this track an attractive one.Recommended album - an excellent addition to any prog music collection. It's a pity if there is someone who loves prog but doe not have this album. Keep on proggin'..!Peace on earth and mercy mild - GW"

But for now, as of 1980, Rush were attaining a peak that produced the marvelous 'Permanent Waves', a marvel in every way: production, songwriting, performance.The flow of the album is due to its compactness, both in terms of each song's ingredients (unlike the title song on 'Hemispheres', there is NOTHING unncessary here) and also its overall length (proving that shorter albums provide more impact). And with the bristling production job by Terry Brown and the band, the album's crystalline, earthy, crisp recording brings out the best in the band's gear and, of course, their always-increasing abilities.The album seems to offer 3 pairs or kinds of tracks:\"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Natural Science\" are the prog epics. \"Jacob's Ladder\" is patient and slowly-building with a foggy, dark tone, while \"Natural Science\" flows from part to part in an exciting, ultra-dynamic ride. Some seriously demented metallic riffs appear, showing where Voivod might have taken some influence when they wrote 'Dimension Hatross'.\"The Spirit Of Radio\" and \"Freewill\" are more compact, FM-friendly rock songs, yet still with an abundance of chops, impressive playing and superb songwriting. Geddy's voice is starting to lower in range, slightly, and it's this era (along with 'Moving Pictures') that I feel represents his finest vocal performances. That these are two of the band's most popular radio songs displays the beauty of Rush: this music is substantial and profound, played by gifted artists, yet it STILL works on mainstream radio. Go figure.\"Entre Nous\" and \"Different Strings\" are not only an obvious pair, they're also next to each other in the running order, sandwiched between the epics, giving the album a good bit of depth. Both could be considered ballads, but as ballads go, they carry a lot more depth and believability than previous attempts (\"Madrigal\" and one I even like a lot, \"Tears\").So, did I mention this is a PERFECT album? Chalk it up: this is Rush's SEVENTH in a string of NINE absolutely awe-inspiring albums."

          "text": "Permanent Wavesgets off to a promising start with a good opening riff, in \"Spirit of Radio\". Drummer NEIL PEART is what DREAM THEATER's MIKE PORTNOY aspired to be.technical but still fitting into the groove like SYMPHONY X drummer JASON RULLO. In some ways I give RUSH credit for being an ancestor to the later prog and technical metal I enjoy, hence my interest in the band. Even in this obvious single, the band still managed to do some innovative things--the reggae section is a fun little change. The first two songs have suffered from some overplaying on the radio, unfortunately. PEART's lyrics are fantastic here--what's said about the music industry is just as timely in these times of RIAA fascism. Ironically, I noticed that GEDDY LEE's vocals are much higher-pitched and screechy on the pop tracks than on the rest of the album.could it be they did do it because it sells?\"Free Will\" is also enjoyable as a song.the lyrics are well-written but a little bit narrow in that they create a false dichotomy between having faith and taking personal responsibility. As for why I feel I can criticize, since PEART's lyrics are of such a high standard, I believe the criticism should be much more advanced as well. However, itwasthe lyrics that first got me into RUSH, most particularly the very true \"If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice.\" Later, the RUSH-influenced DREAM THEATER seems to quote this recognizable set of lyrics with their reference to God as the \"unearthly guide\" in \"The Great Debate\". Musically, we have excellent bass work in the interlude, and this is made an especially good album for its time bynotgoing the 80s drum-machine route.What convinced me to buy this album was that I had the fortune to hear this whole album on the radio when a classic rock station in our area was preparing to change to a different format.I remember that moment of shock when I realized the twofer was going to be an entire album! When \"Jacob's Ladder\" started, it had a totally different feel to the rest, slower-paced, and that really intrigued me. To me, the prog begins in earnest here. The lower-range vocals areveryeffective for him and it was good to see some versatility in his voice. The heavy feeling as the song builds up definitely shows why this group influenced later prog-metal offerings like DREAM THEATER and AYREON.and possibly even the power-metal genre. This is probably my favorite \"first-generation\" prog group after PINK FLOYD, and to be honest, I'm pretty picky about the first-generation stuff. There's some extremely nice synth work in the interlude of this song, not excessively fast, and has a definite mood to it.and as an added bonus, the overall production is pretty good for the time, and it really stood out here!\"Entre Nous\" is another that might've had a crack at being a single, but perhaps it didn't catch on because there was a little less of the screeching stuff from LEE. I also noticed that the lyrics were a bit lighter compared to PEART's usual fare, so while certainly not a bad song, it does seem a little strange in comparison to the rest of the album. On \"Different Strings\", Ilovethe chord transitions--unusual but not overly strange. The lyrics are simple and sweet-again, relationship based. PORTNOY has tried to do the same thing with the cymbals that you hear here, but failed for some odd reason.too little variance as one should expect from a human? PEART pulls it off quite well. While I understand the bass was a real signature instrument for RUSH, it does seem to be mixed slightly loud here.\"Natural Science\" is the other more strongly proggy piece in both music and subject matter. DREAM THEATER seems to have been inspired by the riff you hear around the \"Quantum leap forward\" bit and I'm pretty convinced I've heard them \"quote\" it somewhere. As to this song, I especially give RUSH credit for having good length control; they seem to know exactly how long the listener is willing to listen for and provide that--no more, no less. That's a balancing act that not all prog bands learn to master.Overall, this is an album well-done with only minor critiques--my main one being that it is way too short (though that could be a generational bias)."

          "text": "This wonderful album is the bridge between the 70s and the 80s for Rush and would see the curtain draw on side-long sci epics of yore and set the stage for shorter more concise pieces.\"The Spirit Of Radio\" opens the album and it's the perfect fusion of prog rock integrity and radio-friendly stadium rock that would so elude Genesis and to some extent Yes.The bristling guitar opening,the hammering drums that lead into that incredible arpeggiated riff,the glorious chorus,the reggae finale and inspired outro combine to make this a most singular piece of modern prog. The pace rarely lets up,\"Freewill\" with the monster bass and guitar solo is another radio-friendly piece that again manages to retain the band's integrity leads into the portentous and beautiful \"Jacob's Ladder\". Almost an instrumental this track is the depiction of a rural landscape during a stormy day and the music is flawless in its delivery. Very much a timeless Rush classic. \"Entre Nous\" is a nice track interesting enough to be more than just filler and the slow-burning \"Different Strings\" features a killer fade-out guitar solo.The final track is the incredible \"Natural Science\" a song that features many shifts of pace and moods from the atmospheric tidal pool opening through sci fi wheels-within- wheels to the strident punk-like ending.This musical tour-de-force was actually created with bits from an unused piece which was to be called \"Sir Gawain and The Green Knight\" a potential epic Peart was working on but felt was out of place with the other tracks.I would have no hesitation in saying that this album is the perfect Rush primer and am absolutely confident in its five star status.Buy it and treasure it!"

          "text": "A bit of a question mark between two solid albums. Permanent Waves is the real start to more radio friendly Rush, straying from the long epic style songs they had established on the previous albums. This record is really lacking in a lot of areas, but there's enough there on certain tracks for it to be a keeper.Permanent Waves starts with arguably the best track, a fun and upbeat song in Spirit of the Radio. Freewill is a huge mistake. The chorus comes in and I just get bored to tears. My favorite track on this album is Jacob's Ladder, one of the most interesting songs Rush ever wrote, a real different style to it than most of their works. The rest of the album is very wishy-washy. Nothing really memorable, just some good efforts that don't exactly hit the mark.Overall, I really would not reccommend this record for getting into Rush (that is if you already haven't). The other albums of their \"prime\" are really much better."

          "text": "4.5 STARS.This album marks an important point in the canadian trio's career, and, for my particular point of view, in prog's history, for a reason I will explain later.this is the first album Rush released in the 80's. As such, it also draws a line between what was before and what was to come. Why? I think for two main reasons:- the \"short song\" era of rush has begun. After a period when (for me) Rush knew how to write excellent long, 10+minute songs (even some close to 20), but weaker regular- length ones, in Permanent Waves that chaneges completely: in this album, the solid tracks are the short, more radio-friendly (maybe less prog, too) ones, mostly the two openers, while the two longer songs, (neither of them really long, 7 and 9 minutes respectively) don't quite reach the same level as older pieces like Xanadu, CygnusX-1 or 2112 (which is more of a \"suite\" than a single work). Thus, this is the point when Rush begins to release albums made up of almost exclusively short tracks, which become the band's focus (only a few exceptions like The Camera Eye from Moving Pictures are yet to be created after this 80's release), and also the band's most effective songs (Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Subdivisions, Red Sector A). So, I think it's safe to say that Rush learned how to compose brilliant short songs but at the same time they forgot how good near-epics were created.- Geddy Lee's voice suddenly becomes more \"normal\", or, for lack of a better word, more human. Yes, the high-shrieking, at times scary halloween-like voice he used in such a talented way in 2112, Kings and Hemispheres starts to leave its place to a more ear-friendly, we can say more mainstream-radio-friendly quiet tone, with less (or almost no) yelling and more actual melody singing.- Even though they used Synths a couple of times in the past, the trio's music from now on would get an additional voice, that of synthezisers, which will become an integral, at times imposing, part of the band's sound.And what's the result?The Spirit of Radio (9/10), a brilliant short song. Don't let the prog-purists scare you away from this and other short Rush tracks, for they are amazing, too, and, for my particular taste, actually better than their longer ones. This apparently mundane track is a pure delight for a true rock-lover prog-lover. It starts with a twirling figure in guitar, then we get to a more pure-hard-rock riff, which suddenly fades in favor of the song's main verse, a melodic, wonderful section with clean guitars and great, not complicated yet effective drumming by Neil Peart with amazing use of the ride cymbal. The chorus has the return of the song's opening guitar figure. A short song with a lot of variation, syncopated cymbal-china-playing by Peart (Portnoy listened to this, I can tell). Then, when the main verse is coming to a point of exhaustion, the hard rock riff appears again, followed by, what I think is the song's only weak moment: a few measures in reggae-like rhythm adorned by the cheesy use of a sampler of a theater audience. After a brief solo by Lifeson, the track ends. Great.Freewill (9/10), another amazing short track, this one even less complicated that the preceding one (this one in common verse-prechorus-chorus form), the main riff in odd time (again, Dream Theater listened to this), and the first INFECTIOUS chorus by the canadians, an outstanding chorus. Catchy? You bet. Is that bad, anti-prog? Not at all, it's MUSICAL. When you have simple, standard-structure-songs, you want to have a great chorus that makes up for the lack of innovation in the structure department. This song has it. Weak point? The return, for just a few measures, of Lee's shrieking-witch- like voice before the final chorus.Jacob's Ladder (7/10), this one is longer and illustrates my point: while the short ones were getting better, the long ones were getting weaker. A boring track, starts slowly, in low tempo, with no life; the song up to this point is slowly drowning into oblivion; a calmer, quieter part saves this from complete insomnia-medicine level. Not awful by other group's standards but nothing to do with marvels like Xanadu or Villa Strangiato.Entre nous (6/10), this one is a weak short track ala older Rush. That the title is in french while not a single verse is sung in that language just adds to the lameness factor. Even pen-master Peart had troubles here writing good lyrics. This one is actually poor.Different strings, (8/10), this is another new for Rush: a pure, total ballad. There's no attempt to disguise this as hard-prog rock, this is a hard-rock ballad.... but a good one at that. Don't let the \"only long, serious tracks\" purists take you away from music like this: it may be simple, it may be a little bit cheesy, but when it's done with craft and mastery, it's an enjoyable and irrepleaceble part of this art form, for we all need a moment of rest and reflexion in one's more sentimental side. Also, this one is Geddy Lee's best performance in vocals. Good track.Natural Science, (8/10), an actually incoherent, boring at times track that is saved by a consideration more historical than musical (or better yet, musical-historical): It's my theory that this song actually contains the first progressive-metal section in all of rock. Yes, the middle section in this track has all the elements, the rhythym, the sound, the edge, the heavyness of prog-metal in the purest Dream Theater way. I can almost swear the New York greats (DT) listened more than 100 times this song before embarking into the Images And Words and the When Dream and Day Unite experiences. A fast, lightning speed solo by Lifeson only supports my position. Not the best track but a relevant one and, also, Geddy Lee's best bass- playing in the album.All in all, a good, very good album that clears the path for the Rush I prefer and the one I fell in love with. Surely, songs like Xanadu, La Villa Strangiato and CygnusX-1 I remain as some of this band's best (if not THE BEST) tracks ever. But outside of those marvelous near-epics, the rest of the earlier albums was mostly filler material. When Rush learned how to write great short songs, they found their sound. And don't forget: now (well, then, in 1980 onwards) we got a better singer, too.What do I say about those \"rush got worse 'cause they didn't write long songs ever again\" comments? Well, I like, I LOVE epics, log songs, but not for the sake of length, but for the sake of music. If the music is great, I would love not to have to quit listening to it 5 minutes after it starts....but Rush's epics were flawed, they were not perfect examples of this kind of composition....On the other hand, Rush's short tracks were nothing short of amazing (pun intended)....So, for longer, 20+ tracks, please, give me Yes, give me Genesis, or nowadays, give me The Flower Kings....For short, great songs, GIVE ME RUSH.4.5 STARS"

          "text": "Ironic that the band would open the album with a song titled, \"The Spirit Of Radio\" which would be the first major hit in the US. Sell out? Hardly, but you must admit, the album does have it's share of catchy tunes. I'm not the biggest fan of Geddy's voice or of Alex's guitar work, and on this album neither shine. Rather, it's Neil's drumming, (what else do you expect from the master) and Geddy's nimble basswork, plus the fantastic lyrics that get my attention. My favorites on this disc are \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Natural Science\". Yet, it's not until the following album do they get this style of art rock to sound proggy and catchy at the same time. Not that there's anything wrong with this album. All the ingredients are there. It just seems a bit thin here and there, especially the keys which to these ears don't fill in as well as they do on \"Moving Pictures\". Plus, \"Different Strings\" is a tad boring. This one would garner a 3 from me if it wasn't the actually first album I bought from them back in 1980. So I'll bump it to 4 for old times sake. Caio!"

          "text": "\"Permanent Waves\" has the ability to take me back in time to my youth when I drove around the beach in the summer listening to this amazing record. I can't really describe how good this music makes me feel.This is my favourite album and whenever I doubt this (I listen to so much great music) I play it again and the doubts are removed.There is an element of gloominess to this record which I really like, and the way Geddy uses the synths in the background are perfect. Oh, and the cover is unlike any I have ever seen. Nice.\"The Spirit Of Radio\" is dedicated to our local Toronto radio station CFNY 102.1, a station I listened to a lot in the nineties. Ironically enough they do not play RUSH on that station.\"The spirit of radio\" used to be their catch phrase before they became an alternative station.This song opens with Alex's churning guitar melody as the familiar drumming of Peart comes in. Check out the scathing guitar solo 4 1/2 minutes in. I remember back in 1998 driving down to Florida and hearing this song 3 times through the different states on the way down. That really surprised me as it had been 18 years since the release of this record. I love it when Geddy screams \"Of salesman\" this is my favourite Geddy vocal moment, along with him screaming \"Each of us...\" in the next song \"Freewill\". \"Freewill\" is my all time favourite song. It opens with riffs and Neil's steady drumming as Geddy starts to sing. The background synths are a nice touch.The line \"You can pray for a place in Heaven's unearthly estate\" is outstanding. Alex's guitar solo starts off mournful before he sets it on fire.\"Jacob's Ladder\" opens with marching-like drums giving the imagery of the lyrics that speak of dark, ominous clouds gathering overhead for battle.The soundscape is crushing after a minute, then Alex treats us again to a haunting, melancholic solo. Background synths are added to the pulsating rhythm until it all slows down to almost a stop, then it gradually rebuilds. Awesome tune ! \"Entre Nous\" is as close as RUSH is going to get to a love song.The lyrics are thoughtful and the melody is so uplifting. Great song ! \"Different Strings\" features Hugh Syme on piano and is a melancholic song with meaningful lyrics. Like \"different hearts beat on different strings\". More mournful guitar to end the song. \"Natural Science\" slowly builds until they are rocking 2 minutes in. Neil's drumming is perhaps at it's best on this song as Alex grinds it out, and the synths are again in the background.This song changes moods and tempos often and is a real ride.The band thanks Michael Shenker, FM and The Maxoids (MAX WEBSTER). They also thank Larry Robinson and Steve Shutt from the Montreal Canadiens for the hockey sticks. Steve Shutt and Geddy Lee were friends in school and they used to hang out in the summers after both became famous up here in Canada. They thank Space Invaders which really takes me back to the early eighties.They mention some of the past times they enjoyed at the time and TV shows. This album is more than just music to me, it's part of my history and a time machine all rolled into one."

There is so much expression and brilliance contained within Peart's lyrics that I sometimes feel philosophically enlightened after listening.

          "text": "Begin the decade with a friendly voiceA new decade arrives and Rush have a hit single! The band obviously only had one thing on their mind when they recorded \"The spirit of radio\", the commercial nature of the track instantly securing the radio play it was so clearly designed for. We should not be too hard on Rush though, this is not asell outsong. Geddy Lee's vocals and Alex Lifeson's guitar work still stamp the badge of authenticity on the product.The change of style is however clear with the following \"Freewill\" also being instantly accessible, with a strong hook and melodic vocals. The chiming guitars are reminiscent of ELO's \"10538 overture\" the song itself being orthodox pop rock. \"Jacob's ladder\" is not thetraditionalsong of that name, but it is the slowest and heaviest song on the album. The track builds like a bolero with vocals and drifting synth sounds adding to the overall power of the song. This is undoubtedly one of Rush's most accomplished and finest pieces.The second side of the album has a similar layout to the first, with two short, commercially orientated songs, and a longer more structured track. \"Entre nous\" leans heavily on the synthesiser backing, but the song itself is rather dull, lacking any real spark. The ballad \"Different strings\" which follows is surprisingly downbeat and sparse, with sensitive lyrics. It is not particularly original, sounding a bit like theobligatory balladwhich many bands include on an album, but it is pleasant nonetheless.The closing \"Natural science\" is the longest track on the album at 9 minutes. The opening section continues the soft acoustic mood of the preceding track, but the volume quickly rises as the band present an altogether more traditional sounding Rush epic.With a total running time of 35 minutes, \"Permanent waves\" is somewhat miserly on content. The four shorter radio friendly songs signal that the band is moving away from its more progressive past, but the two feature tracks offer a fine olive branch to those who crave for more of the same."

          "text": "Rush's Permanent Waves is the fourth classic in a row for the band. It is a highly important record, as it marked the transition from heavy, border-line metal prog to the poppier synth sound that would define their 80s output. It also marks the lyrical transition from Peart's sci-fi obsession to mature and deep subject matter. Who'd have thought Peart would be such a great lyricist? This is a polarizing album: old fans point to this as the beginning of the end of the band, while others saw the lyrical brilliance and musicianship that make this album great. As always, the band gels like no other group on the planet, not even jazz bands. Geddy's voice has changed from the mad screams of previous albums into a more restrained but no less powerful tenor, which he maintains to this day. His bass playing is still some of the best you'll ever hear. Lifeson puts his stamps on the songs with beautiful melodies and terrific solos. Peart, well, we all know he's God.The album opens with the standard \"The Spirit of Radio,\" named after a radio station in Toronto. I don't know why people call this a sellout song. Yes, it's made for radio, but listen to the lyrics. The song attacks the music industry's corruption of radio from a device to hear music into just another tool to sell copies. The fact that it's tailor-made for radio play is genius. The band took John Lennon's \"Imagine\" approach to songwriting: sugarcoat your message so that many don't realize the attack. Plus, Rush introduce reggae into their music, which would surface from time to time in the future. \"Freewill\" is another classic with great lyrics. Peart pens an anthem of self-reliance. The chorus is wonderful and Alex's solo is one of his best. \"Jacob's Ladder\" is weak lyrically, as it details the dream of a prophet. However, the composition is staggering. Pounding bass and incredible guitar that slowly builds for the entire piece. This song bored me stiff the first time I heard it, but another listen and it all clicked.\"Entre Nous\" never really did it for me until I saw the band recently. It's a solid song, but it lacks the power of the rest of the tracks here. \"Different Strings\" is a beauty with melancholic vibes. Rush wouldn't make another song so moving until they released several moving songs on Vapor Trails two decades later. Entre Nous and Strings share a lyrical theme of rocky romance. The album closes with \"Natural Science,\" a look into society's oppression of the individual and how honest men are \"an endangered species.\" This features some jaw-dropping work from the band, particularly Peart, who does things no mortal could ever hope to accomplish.The album is rather short, but remember that back in the days of vinyl that meant better sound quality. Waves has the misfortune of falling between Rush's two masterpieces, yet it proudly holds its own. This is one of Rush's most enjoyable albums, and it's one of precious few devoid of filler. \"Entre Nous\" is the only track that comes close to being a throwaway. It falls just short of being a masterpiece, but Rush would ensure that their next album would make that final leap.Grade: B+"

Spirit of the Radio is perhaps the best song that they have ever released, although Subdivisions gives it a lot of competition. Freewill has been one of their concert staples since it's release. The dark and atmospheric Jacob's Ladder goes off in a direction that Rush has rarely explored in a magnificent manner. And finally we have Natural Science, which is a brilliant epic that ranks with the best of anything that has been released by other prog bands. It may not have quite the story that 2112 had, but the music here is unequaled elsewhere.Only a handful of albums this good have ever been released. If you haven't heard this one, find a copy and listen to it.5 stars all the way."

Everyone has a favorite and, especially if you were young during the band's heyday, each album brings you back to a certain time, often one of musical discovery and the realization that rock music could be more than just three-minute ditties about broken hearts and drinking. And that was the beauty of progressive rock, it took us away from the confines of the blues and allowed further growth. Rush accomplished this as well as anyone but added cool heavy metal flash and high-tech bravado.A Farewell To Kingswas good,Hemisphereswas a huge leap forward butPermanent Waveswas their most realized, eloquent and precise statement of what they did best.Alex Lifeson wastes no time ripping open 'Spirit of the Radio' with a Hackett-like riff, Neil Peart and Geddy Lee's accents beginning the day with a friendly voice, a track that shows the dynamic range of these maestros. Quirky guitar lines and a classic lyric from Peart on the importance of independent thinking in 'Freewill', and compelling drama for 'Jacob's Ladder' as the sky grows dark with Lifeson's stern muted chunks, building into a distant overture of synths and great space-filling by Peart. The second half is even better, if that's possible, and features the wise and wistful 'Entre Nous', a sophisticated rocker showing remarkable sensitivity and intelligence for a power trio, even more than they had shown in previous work. Love song 'Different Strings' is a tender tribute, further demonstrating a band with much to say and a drummer-turned-lyricist who knew how to say it. And to top-off an already classic piece of modern rock, the brilliant 'Natural Science', full of light, charged molecules, and a deft commentary on the rhythm of life.Though they produced albums that were more popular, Rush never did anything that was superior to this.Permanent Wavesremains a critical turning point for them and a coming-of-age record for all young people interested in what progressive rock has to offer."

          "text": "One of my fav Rush albums, no doubt, and among their best. From this one they write much shorter pieces, then on previous albums and the result is very good. I'm not agree with reviewers that said they try to go comercial with Permanent Waves, not even the opening track Spirit of the radio is not an every day tune, is prog but in other way put by the band. Again every musician shines on every piece just listen to Entre nous and the slow one Different strings, beautiful as always. Voice of Geddy Lee is outstanding both on slow and smooth pieces and in the pieces with more vein. Not to mention Neil Peart who is responsable with the lyrics did a great job, and the druming, o gosh what a drumer. Alex Lifeson is on of the best guitar heroes of prog music, and here is absolute outstanding on Jacob's ladder and Natural science. The rest are also great. 4 stars and among the best albums of the early '80."

          "text": "A great halfway point between pop RUSH and hard rocking prog RUSH.Following up 2 of the best progressive rock albums of all time in 'A Farewell to Kings' and 'Hemispheres' was never going to be an easy task but RUSH managed to do a fine job, cobbling together a great album which although quite doesn't reach the same level as it's predecessors is good in it's own right.Things start off strong with the hard rocking anthem 'Spirit of the Radio' with some fiery guitar work from Lifeson and we catch a glimpse of the synth-pop RUSH that was to come in the chorus but it isn't too bad at this point, the song on the whole is great and the little reggae breakdown towards the end is particularly good. 'Freewill' is very much in the same vein as 'Spirit of the Radio', and is incredibly catchy, there are some great riffs and progressions here.Jacob's ladder is the first real progressive song on the album and what a song!, it starts off innocuous enough with some nice chords and a bit of marching snare work from Peart before things become staccated before launching into some brooding middle eastern inspired guitar driven territory with a great solo then coming to rest peacefully - one of RUSH's best prog songs. 'Entre Nous' and 'Different strings' are where the album really dives, there is nothing really to these songs they aren't prog and they are quite poppy and weak. Natural science more than makes up for it, easily the best song on the album it starts off slowly before becoming frenetic and incorporating crazy timings with the best synth work in the album and the best solo in the album (Lifeson shreds!). Things end triumphantly with some lighter music and some great bass work from Geddy and some inspired lyrics \"Art as expression, not that much it can change, will still capture our imaginations\" and yet more shredding from Lifeson - a brilliantly written prog piece.Overall Permanent waves is a solid album and most of the songs are good or great, it isn't as proggy as previous efforts from the band and is moving towards the more accessible poppy sound on later albums further along in the decade but it's definitely worthwhile for any heavy prog fan and essential for any RUSH fan."

          "text": "While Hemispheres is my alltime favourite Rush album, it is this album and the following Moving Pictures that to me marked out Rush as an alltime great band. Why?? Because they showed they could change their sound without losing anything from previous albums that was great about them, indeed adding new dimensions to their art. Sure, older fans were alienated by the change (much like hardcore Ozzy fans must have decried the unspeakably brilliant Heaven and Hell album of Black Sabbath at the time of its release) but that is usually the case in rock n roll anyway (post-Uli Roth Scorpions is another such instance, again Lovedrive and Blackout ranking among the best albums of that band).However, I was not fortunate enough to watch these bands grow and that, fortunately, makes me more neutral about their albums through the years. This is a Rush still belting out proto-prog metal rivalled by none at that time (or even today). Hell, Natural Science possibly rocks harder than Trees and Jacob's Ladder has riffs that would make Tony Iommi proud. At the same time, they show they are able to write accessible, indeed radio-friendly, songs that still retain all the accomplished musicianship we look forward to from Rush. Sure, Spirit of Radio and Freewill are radio-friendly, but in a good way, like Pink Floyd's Money or Jethro Tull's Locomotive Breath. And, IMHO, Different Strings and Entre Nous rank among the finest creations of Rush. Sure, they are not in the least complex compositions but they show the sensitive, mature side of Rush.Here, I would like to digress a bit with an example based on Metallica. After deeply influencing thrash and making it a more epic and complex beast than its other frontrunners had conceived possible and in turn successfully pulling off mainstream metal/rock, Metallica tripped heavily in covering the seemingly simple Black Sabbath song Sabracadabra. Rush however proved on Permanent Waves that they could write accessible rock that was also intelligent and beautiful at the same time, a dimension they had not displayed till then in their songwriting. In essence, they could straddle the complex epics and the simple, soulful rockers/ballads effortlessly.Coming to the instrumental attack, this is probably more guitar-oriented than Hemispheres with some uninhibited but inventive shredding from Lifeson as opposed to his tight performance in the previous album. At the same time, Geddy Lee's keyboards too begin to play a bigger role in the mix than before. How is this achieved?? Well, as mentioned earlier, the band expanded and enriched their sound to accomplish that which they could not have in the previous outings.And that, more than anything else, is the reason to recommend any prog rock album highly. When a band change in a good way and even improve upon their previous work, it means the album is still interesting for a prog rock fan and Permanent Waves certainly passes that test.Dock points?? What for, this album is perfect in every way. Ok, I will be politically correct and give it 4.75 :P"

          "text": "Back to one of my ancient favourite bands. I always thought this is an intrigueing album because it marked the transition form the old to the new Rush. In other words the real symphonic to the more crossover Rush. The predecessor Hemispheres was the apogee of the old period and for many their best album. The successor of PW, Moving Pictures is an already very accessable album, reflecting the new Rush. And Permanent Waves is somewhere in between although I believe it comes closer to Moving Pictures than to Hemispheres.Next thing that's striking to me is the popularity of this album. It has a real high average but I wonder what the great highlight is. I mean, it's not a bad album but it's far from outstanding I believe. Maybe the last track stands out a little, it still has the symphonic elements but the rest are average songs that have no extra dimension. Spirit of the radio was in the charts if I remember correctly but to call it a breakthrough for Rush in the commercial scene goes too far, don't you think ?So although this is an interesting one in the history of Rush I can't find the great charme musicwise. So it'll have to settle for 3."

          "text": "Released in 1980,Permanent Waveswas the album that fused the progressive tendencies that Rush showed on their '70s material with a mint production and it even gave us a few signs of the transition that the band would undergo on their next few albums.This album was released only a year beforeMoving Picturesand has unfortunately been overshadowed by that release ever since. I consider it truly a pity becausePermanent Wavesis a far superior package in every single category. It has stronger hits (The Spirit Of Radio,Freewill,Entre Nous), a ballad that blowsWitch HuntandVital Signsout of the water (Different Strings) and, most importantly the best progressive rock moments (Jacob's LadderandNatural Science).Natural Scienceis by far my favorite composition that Rush have ever recorded. It has amazing lyrics which are perfectly matched by its music content. The two minute atmospheric intro transitions into one great Alex Lifeson-riff after the other and Geddy Lee adds a few underlying synthesizer melodies that elevate the band's performance to a whole new level. Still it's Neil Peart who once again steals the show for me here. Just listen to all the little polyrhythmic fills that he literally floods the music with! The only minor complaint here is the slightly trivial guitar-solo halfway through the track which sounds a bit out of place compared to all the other difficult patterns that the band has given us so far. Surprisingly enough I actually find this flaw quite charming especially since I don't believe in such a thing as a perfect recording althoughNatural Sciencedefinitely comes close to it!Seeing the band perform live during theirSnakes & Arrowstour was a great experience for me. The fact that they played four out of the six songs off this record during that performance really showed that the album has withstood the test of time! It's simply a great album that everyone should own.***** star songs: The Spirit Of Radio (4:56) Jacob's Ladder (7:26) Natural Science (9:17)**** star songs: Freewill (5:21) Entre Nous (4:36) Different Strings (3:48)Total Rating: 4,61"

          "text": "Rush's best effort by far: it completely rinses Hemispheres and Farewell, while it marginally beats Moving Pictures, their supposed master work. Every single song on this wonderful album is a classic Rush song, especially Spirit of the Radio, Jacob's Ladder and the finale Natural Science. The musicianship is flawless also, and what's better is despite being pure progressive rock, it is also very rock and roll. Here is why I love this album so much, with a track by track:1. Spirit of the radio - Dare I say it, the best intro in the whole of rock history, therefore making it the best album intro in the whole of rock history. This is Rush's best known song, and for very good reason! (10/10)2. Freewill - Another Rush classic here, I especially like the peculiar time signatures and the chorus in this song. The keyboards are also quite pretty. (8/10)3. Jacob's ladder - Second masterpiece of the album, this is definitely the proggiest of the lot. One of my personal favourite Rush songs, this is direly underated as a song. (10/10)4. Entre nous - Another great short song from Rush. This one is especially catchy and delivers some nice guitar work from Mr Lifeson. (9/10)5. Different strings - The penultimate track is probably the weakest on the album, but it still is worthy of being on this masterpiece. The shortness of it also has a certain charm to it. (8/10)6. Natural science - AHA! The greatest Rush song of all time without a doubt. Everything about this song screams epic and prog in your face. The guitaring, drumming and bass work is astounding on this song and I love everything about it, from the addictive riff at around 2 minutes to the complete rhythm change about halfway through. This song is a necessity to any prog fan! (10/10)Overall, a masterpiece album. I need not say more, other than buy it if you haven't already got it. 5/5."

          "text": "...And the words of the prophets were written on the studio wall...As the 70s came to an end many of the prog rock giants were unable to produce work of the same caliber that they once had. Being a product of the late 70s anyways, Rush was somehow able to adapt and release this fantastic album. Very different in style from their previous works and yet somehow similar at the same time, Rush pushes into the shorter song format while still leaving some pure prog gems in their wake. For me this has always been a very friendly album, despite it's topics at times. Definitely one of Rush's most accessible works, this is one that will always find a place on my cd player.Likely fueled by their own dislike for their previous prog-masterpiece,Hemispheres, Rush cranks up the volume and manages to put some some excellent rock music. The album opens with to of the band's biggest hits. The oh-so familiar riff of the concert favoriteThe Spirit Of Radiowarms the listener with it's synths and riffs along with that interesting reggae breakdown near the end. Though better live (it was always a dream of mine to be one of the people screaming when Geddy shouts ''Concert Hall!''... which I got to do last summer) this song is still a great track.Freewillfollows this one, with it's objective viewpoint of human nature. Again a familiar, rock-anthem riff from Lifeson and a very catchy chorus that made this song such a hit to begin with.Coming onto the second side there's some more short rock songs, these ones a tad weaker than their side one counterparts. The spaced outEntre Nous(well performed on the Snakes and Arrows tour) kicks off the fray with some strong synths and melodies. The guitar in this one is a bit less pronounced and the tone is very much more low-key than some of the songs off the first side, but its a good song none the less. Unfortunately, the songs that it's had to compete with (Spirit, Freewill) make it seems weaker on the album.Different Stringsis kind of the obligatory slow song. Cool lyrics from Peart, making use of his poetic skills mixed with his normal lyrics about human nature. Good song, reminiscent of something likeTearsfrom2112, but likely the weakest track on the album.Then there's the longer tracks. On an album that houses such good short tracks are the longer ones going to be any good? Well, Rush has always been a band that's been great with the longer tracks, and these are no exception. The dark, moodyJacob's Ladderhas always been a personal favorite (although I prefer the...Exit Stage Leftperformance). It's short use of lyrics and subsequent instrumentalism (that almost seems like it could bring down rumbling clouds over your head) make this song one of the best tracks in the Rush catalog... if one of the least accessible (ironic that it's n the band's most accessible album). A fantastic journey from start to finish, no progger should be without this song. Topping off the album, however, is the even better -- multi-part-mini-suite --Natural Science(another live favorite). Starting with the sound of gulls and and Alex's subdued guitar under Geddy's echoed voice this song is of to a promising start. It's not long until the song explodes into full motion. A slick riff from Lifeson and some pounding bass from Geddy make his song an even better journey thanJacob's Ladder. Peart is back with his objective lyrics, this time comparing civilization to tide pools, where the creatures liveing in their little worlds forget about the larger picture -- the sea from whence the came. Interesting use of vocal effects on some of the parts and some truly excellent soloing throughout make this song THE definitive standout on the album. AKA -- if you buy the album for one song, it's this one. (There's also an amazing live version of this one on theRush in Riolive album).A bit of a biased review? Perhaps, but since this album is likely my favorite album of all time it must have done something right to get into that position. 5 stars. While the first couple songs of the second half may be weaker than the album as a whole they're easily redeemed by the behemoth that isNatural Science. Highly, HIGHLY recommended. The only people who won't enjoy this album are the people who condemn Rush for having Geddy as a vocalist. But even they will likely enjoyJacob's Ladder."

          "text": "Putting aside the errors of prog overindulgence, RUSH settle back and do what they're best at: write good tunes.Within moments, RUSH's trademark crunchy guitars herald not another side-long prog epic like the ill-advised '2112' or 'Cygnus X-1 Book II', but a radio-friendly sound, marking the beginning of their move away from traditional progressive phrasing. I'm not overly fond of 'Spirit of the Radio', finding it frivolous, but I approve of what they're trying to do. With the benefit of hindsight, the direction they take on this album was a necessary prelude to 'Moving Pictures'. I simply don't think the band had the compositional chops to write the sort of prog epics they attempted in the late 70s: they realised this and moved towards music best described as prog-related with this and subsequent albums.After 'Spirit of the Radio' comes 'Freewill', a track dominated by a splendid LIFESON solo. There are prog elements here, particularly in PEART's drumming, but they're a necessary part of the song, not paraded self-consciously. 'Jacob's Ladder' manages to avoid overstaying its welcome, but what on earth were they thinking with those harsh, two-bees-in-a-dustbin synths?I'm afraid the second side of the album does not measure up to the first, continuing the RUSH tradition of unevenness. 'Entre Nous' is a fairly innocuous art rock song, easily culled on an iTunes playlist but unfortunate given that, at 35 minutes, this album has no fat to trim. 'Different Strings' ratchets the pace down a few notches, a welcome change, but ultimately the song is little more than a facile ballad with a defeated fadeout ending, as though inspiration has deserted them. 'Natural Science' harks back to previous albums, though the riffs here sustain the song for its nine minute length. RUSH have learned the virtue of brevity at last. Interestingly, in this song one can hear many of the elements that bands like DREAM THEATER took to heart.Another in a long line of frustrating RUSH albums, 'Permanent Waves' is actually a misnomer. The waves it makes are uneven and, at best, temporary, a prelude to the tsunami that was their next album."

          "text": "Sometimes albums can take several bashes about in order to understand what goes on. If you don't get what my jive is, let me explain it this way; I once thought that PERMANENT WAVES was fluttered with too many flaws to achieve the masterpiece status even though I loved quite a good portion of the album. I even reviewed the album during the growing phase (the original review date was 4/25/2008; the day of re-write is 5/22/2009) hoping there would be an epiphany to come. I already know the euphoria of the two most ''prog-like'' songs (''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''Natural Science'') but I'm going to go on and say that ''Natural Science'' is possibly nine minutes of exactly what Rush represented in their heyday; intricately structured epic-esque pieces of music littered with blistering guitar solos and drum fills, odd metred riffs that harken to hard rock all in a pace that will keep the listener interested throughout.Even if we don't observe the longer pieces, the shorter ones also deserve their fair share of praise. Songs like ''Freewill'' and ''The Spirit of Radio'' sacrifice the weird fantasy themes and banshee shrieks of earlier albums in favour of bright guitar riffs and pop-like sensibilities with an insane amount of tweaking to them. ''Entre Nous'' might be a little ho-hum compared to everything else, but I still have a soft spot for it. ''Different Strings'' will be filler for most people, but I've found it to be one of the better cases of Rush goes soft along with ''Madrigal''.I'd say that PERMANENT WAVES is much better than HEMISPHERES simply because on the latter effort, Rush tried way too hard to have prog kudos and ended up having a bloated epic. However, I think PERMANENT WAVES has more focused songwriting and tighter interplay all the while retaining that heavy-progressive edge that characterized Rush's previous two efforts. An absolute highlight for any Rush fan."

          "text": "Review 37, Permanent Waves, Rush, 1980StarStarStarStar Permanent Waves is naturally paired with its successor, Moving Pictures. In my opinion, Permanent Waves is a much, much better album, with more genuine and moving atmospheres, the boring moments focused on a couple of shorter tracks rather than creating a sort of inverse magnum opus in The Camera Eye. The high points of the album definitely merit the cost, but there are weaknesses. I enjoy this one.Noone can accuse Rush of not having a knack for openers, and The Spirit of Radio is proof of this, with great rocking guitar parts, a non-screechy, yet enjoyable and singalongable vocal from Lee (combined with a humming and very liberated bass part), Peart throws in great normal drumming, as well as shining with glockenspiel (or something similar) and tympani in the more progressive sections. Some solid enjoyable lyrics sail behind the music, including a nicely-used reference to Simon And Garfunkel's The Sound Of Silence. The combination of rather progressive sections and harder rock is handled sublimely, and we get a lively and energetic solo from Lifeson.Freewill's opening comparatively lumbers a bit, with overdone synths and a rather awkward ambling guitar part (coupled with boring, bombastic drums). It doesn't help that the lyrics are, while original in idea and form of expression, very forced at times ('they weren't born in lotus-land'). The choruses pick up a lot musically, but Geddy's voice just doesn't quite make the impact that it sometimes does. A rather mechanically inserted instrumental break features some rather odd bass playing from Geddy, a many-many notes per second solo from Lifeson, that was a bit acquired for me, but I now enjoy it. The conclusion is really no better than the original part, and the song overall a rather bland experience.Jacob's Ladder is a surprising gem, with a very dark, powerful atmosphere that Rush rarely attempt to build. The Lee-Peart rhythm section outdo themselves, through a rather vicious, military and driving feel. Lifeson shifts adeptly between a dark rhythm guitar and some stunning solos. Geddy Lee handles the vocals with tension and emotion, and his synths are a lighter counterpart to the powerful guitar, rather than ineffectual. In the build-up to a massive crashing section, we get a great decisiveness and a feeling of spontaneity that Rush often seems to lack. Everyone on top form, and the atmosphere is very moving.Entre Nous is rather a let-down after this, because the vocal is simply annoying and upbeat, failing to provide a real feel (the lyrical idea is good enough, though the wording doesn't satisfy me). The guitars are top notch, using acoustics and electrics well. Peart is responsible, with a rolling style more reminiscent of his earlier stuff on 2112 or Caress Of Steel, for most of the impact of the chorus, but his work on the verses simply holds no real interest for me, getting annoying if I listen too hard. A synth solo actually works better than I'd have expected, and it does give an opportunity to a brief, but no less likable, bass solo from Lee. Not absolutely terrible, but it leaves a lot to be desired.The gentle song of the album, Different Strings, is a very good piece, with a combination of acoustic guitar and a wonderful piano that weaves into it, an effectively uplifting bass (a rarity) part, and some decent Peart additions on drums from the second verse onwards. Alex Lifeson provides one of the slow emotional background solos we've earlier seen on Into The Darkness, as well as a rather more bulky one at the song's end. Certainly not a weakness.The long concluding piece, the tri-partite Natural Science, doesn't disappoint, beginning with a slow, gradually appearing-and-disappearing acoustic, some watery effects, some completely odd effects and a watery vocal with the right sort of distant feel for the song. The rocking chorus 'Time after time in a spiral away...' flows right into the next section, concluding Tidal Pools.The fast beat of Hyperspace, with its speed, mechanical, distorted vocal, a set of interesting drums from Peart and a use of a moog synthesiser as well as Lee's usual array of stuff. A mocking derision of the technological side of society gives way to a moving solo from Lifeson (rather reminiscent of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, only faster) and then a return to the chorus.Permanent Waves gives us the album's most grandiose moment, with a positive, determined vocal, some of the classic bombastic drumming-guitar ideas that pervade Rush's discography (only, they work!). A whirling guitar solo from Lifeson appears over a static bass drum line. The gradual drive-up to the chorus's alter-ego is perfectly handled, twisting with a concision and constant mobility. The instruments are relaxed in favour of a water effect fade, which works perfectly in context. An exceptional piece of work, with constantly good playing from everyone, an atmosphere of its own and it manages to hold interest throughout. Definitely a much-loved Rush piece, for me.In conclusion, there are two weak tracks that I don't like on this album. On the other hand, there are four gems that should be in the collection of any (progressive) music lover. Essential, but not a masterpiece. The feel of the album isn't quite rounded due to the aberrations that are Entre Nous and Free Will, but that shouldn't discourage anyone from getting it.Rating: Four StarsFavourite Track: Natural ScienceEdit: Last listen placed it as a firm three... I can't say that it has the same freshness it did when I wrote this review."

          "text": "\"Permanent Waves\"is the 7th full-length studio album by Canadian progressive rock actRush. The album was released throughMercury Records(US/Europe)/Anthem Records(Canada) in January 1980. It\ufffds the successor to\"Hemispheres\"from 1978. After completing the 8 months long tour supporting\"Hemispheres (1978)\", the band felt worn and took a six weeks break, before uniting again to begin writing material for what would become\"Permanent Waves\". A short tour followed whereRushwould introduce some of the new material, and in September 1979 they entered Le Studio in Quebec with producerTerry Brown, where the already written material were given a final brush and enough additional material were written for a full-length release.\"Permanent Waves\"marks a bit of a stylistic chance forRush. After the arguably most progressive period of their career (1976-1978), the band felt a need for change and most of the tracks on\"Permanent Waves\"are therefore shorter, more immediately catchy, and less complex in structure than the material on the preceding releases. This should not be understood as if this is not progressive or challenging music though, as there are plenty of adventurous songwriting and technincally skillful playing on the album. The progressive parts are just typically a little more subtle or hidden within the context of the songs, allowing more catchy and melodic moments to stand out.The album opens with\"The Spirit of Radio\", which on the surface is an almost mainstream pop/rock oriented song, featuring an energetic and uplifting mood, but when you listen a bit more closely it\ufffds quite the complex and intriguing progressive rock composition, featuring many different parts and time signature changes.\"Freewill\"follows and it\ufffds another album highlight. It\ufffds a catchy and memorable track, but like the preceding track it\ufffds a more complex composition than it may initially appear.\"Jacob's Ladder\"is a slow building, atmospheric, and ultimately heavy track. It\ufffds quite an epic track and features a total playing time of 7:31 minutes.\"Entre Nous\"opens what was Side B of the original vinyl release, and it\ufffds a melodic rock song. Not the most adventurous moment of the album, but still a decent quality composition.\"Different Strings\"is the mellow power ballad track of the album.Rushhad included tracks like that on previous releases too, so the mainstram oriented nature of the song isn\ufffdt a surprise. It\ufffds a decent track but not exactly a highlight of the album. The 9:16 minutes long\"Natural Science\"closes\"Permanent Waves\". It\ufffds an epic progressive rock track subdivided into three parts titled\"I: Tide Pools\",\"II: Hyperspace\",\"III: Permanent Waves\". It\ufffds by far the most complex and progressive composition on the album and arguably an album highlight.Rushare as well playing/singing as ever (Geddy Lee\ufffdshigh pitched voice and singing style are probably as always a deal breaker for some and a great joy for others) and\"Permanent Waves\"also features a well sounding production job (co-produced byRushandTerry Brown), which suits the material perfectly. There\ufffds power and bite here and it\ufffds definitely a case of high quality production values. Upon conclusion\"Permanent Waves\"reeks high class in all departments, from the high level musical performances, to the above mentioned high quality production values, to the intriguing and varied songwriting. A 4 - 4.5 star (85%) rating is deserved.(Originally posted on Metal Music Archives)"

          "text": "Permanent Waves is the latest album I have purchased of Rush, due to the fact that with my other Rush Cds I had somehow accumulated all but two tracks from this album, at least live versions and some on compilations. However, I am glad I bit the bullet and got hold of this as its an absolute masterpiece and quintessential Rush. It is become one of the top 5 Cds in my Rush collection. The main reason this album works so well as there are no filler tracks. It is a new style of Rush in comparison to previous efforts but it is surprisingly mainstream yet still keeping the aspects of prog.The first track, 'The Spirit of Radio' was a massive hit for the band and it is easy to see why. It has some of the most endearing and memorable guitar work from Alex Lifeson. Listen to that phased out lead work in the intro, and the way the time signature instantly changes only to kick into a standard 4/4 riff. Geddy Lee's high soprano vocals have never been better and you have to love the lyrics: \"Begin the day with a friendly voice, a companion, unobtrusive, plays that song that's so elusive, and the magic music makes your morning mood.\" This example of crazy alliteration that evokes a quirky sense of humour has defined the Rush sound. The track works effectively as a radio jingle promoting the medium, no wonder it was a top 20 UK hit in 1980, one of the greatest rock singles ever. It even features a startling reggae breakdown towards the end that shouldn't work but Rush makes it work because they are masters of song structure. After the words \"Concert hall\" we hear a crowd roaring, which really adds to the overall effect of the track. Lifeson's wah wah guitar solo is amazing. A short blast of the opening riff and then it ends abruptly.The next track 'Freewill' is also a terrific prog track with an excellent melody that stays in your head, notably the melodic chorus \"you can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice, if you choose not to decide you still have made a choice.\" Great stuff and a live favourite. Another notable track and the main reason for my interest in the album was the standout epic 'Natural Science'. It clocks in at a little over 9 minutes and is a type of multimovement suite with variations of light and shade in three sections. I had heard this on the live \"Different Stages\" but this, the studio version, way outclasses the live version for production value. Wind chimes, tubular bells, atmospherics, jagged guitar riffs and all manner of instruments merge together on this epic to produce one of the finest recordings of the band.In conclusion, Permanent Waves is an essential purchase and a good starting point for those interested in Rush."

          "text": "Different stringsIn my opinion, Rush reached their progressive and artistic peak with the previous Hemispheres. After the masterpiece that was Hemispheres, Permanent Waves is a little bit of a disappointment. The opening track, Spirit Of Radio was the first ever \"commercial\" Rush track and as such pointed towards things to come on future albums. This song simply seems to be designed for radio play. Freewill similarly is a more simple and straightforward composition than what Rush offered us on 2112, A Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres. These two tracks bring this album down a bit for me, but the rest of the album contains more classic Rush material. But even the best and most progressive numbers add little to what we already was given on the aforementioned trio of great albums and really only Natural Science is up to the standards set by these previous classic albums.Permanent Waves is for me the least good album of Rush's classic period (2112 to Moving Pictures) and, even if it is indeed another good Rush album, it was the first sign of Rush's imminent decline that started with Signals and culminated with the awful Power Windows.Not Rush's best, but still part of their best period and contains some great moments"

          "text": "This is an splendid album... But not a masterpiece in my opinion!The disc starts in a magnificient way with the hits The Spirit of Radio and Freewill... I specially like the first one, being a really catchy track with even a reggea middle part! Freewill is also another anthem with a great solo and Geddy's bass playing.Then, comes another great Rush's song... The proggy Jacob's Ladder, a song full of soundscapes in the vein of Vangelis and with a good keyboard's work. I also like the riffing of the song... A Rush's little classic. But then, the album enters in a kind of weak section... Entre Nous is a usual rock song in the vein of Caress of Steel or the short tracks of 2112. Just an OK rock song, but nothing special... And Different Strings is also not very interesting. A slow track with some interesting bass playing, but not really inspired.Luckily, the end of the album is brilliant... Natural Science returns the power of the beginning, even surpasing it. The first acoustic guitars are the introduction for an amount of catchy and variated riffs, offering the most progressive track of the album, and maybe the best one. Is the perfect good bye for an excellent (but far from perfect...) album.Best tracks: the level of the album is very high... Only Entre Nous and Different Strings are not great songs. The rest are excellent pieces of music.Conclusion: Permanent Waves is not so progressive as Hemispheres, and not so high in quality as A Farewell to Kings... Is also maybe a bit under the quality of Moving Picgtures. But it is an excellent album anyway, with a use of keyboards and some song structures wich give a glimpse of what Rush would make through the 80's. This is a brilliant closing to a decade, and a transition to a new Rush's era. And of course, a worthy addition to any collection of good music.My rating: ****"

The sound is uncompleted with some sharply changes in the tempo, some jazz fusion and new wave elements from the 80s and mixture of repetitions and lack of synchronous. The album is like prelude to something that never comes. The lack of ideas is tangible. It's hard for me to listen to the whole album at once.The first song - Spirit of the Radio - is very interesting song with three elements that followed one to other constantly, but developed poorly. The second song - Freewill - is weak enough to comment it. The third song - Jacob's Ladder - again roaming between the genres without reasonable inception of the action. This is the typical for the album. The fourth song - Entre Nous - full of meaningless solos and folk rock elements. The fifth song - Different Strings - a low quality ballad. The sixth song - Natural Science - another long and decent progressive song.An album without unexpected and fresh ideas only for the fans of the band. 2 stars"

          "text": "Rush's 1980 release of Permanent Waves showed a shift in musical priorities for the group and can be considered the first transitional album into a more radio-friendly environment, but still retaining strong progressive rock elements. It also showed the continuing transition of making keyboards a more dominant instrument in the group's sound. This had been evolving steadily on their previous two releases, A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978).While this shift kept the group from composing 10+ minute-long epic (something I surely miss from the later Rush years of the 1980s and 1990s), it attracted a whole legion of fans with their radio hits The Spirit of Radio (appropriately titled!) and Freewill. Entre Nous was also a beautiful example of the effective blend of keyboards into this new, more compact style of Rush's music; a precursor of what would appear on several albums throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s.Still, Rush continued to display their talents on the slightly longer songs, like the killer Jacob's Ladder and the amazing Natural Science. Production improved and Lee's vocals continued to mature. The end result is another five-star masterpiece. It may not have the epic-like qualities of prior albums, but it surely makes up for it with the improved production, skilled musicianship, and better vocal deliveries. Highly recommended."

          "text": "A quantum leap forward, in time and in space...Another extremely powerful release from the trio from Canada during their classic period, Permanent Waves is most well known in the music world for The Spirit of Radio, Freewill, and Jacob's Ladder, all of which have become well-established Rush classics and often performed live. But if you only focus on those three tracks, then you're forgetting the other half of the album. Here marks a clear change away from Hemispheres and towards what would become Moving Pictures, often considered the pinnacle Rush album. However, this one is no slouch either. Absolute musical perfection right here as far as I'm concerned.My two favorite tracks on here are Jacob's Ladder and Natural Science. The first is one of them because of that great thundering, pompous, and driving bass and drum work, as well as the heaven-esque synths. Everything about that song just speaks of majesty to me. Natural Science has that beautiful sound and feeling of rushing water with Geddy's singing and the acoustic guitar evokes such a tender feeling from me that it sends chills down my spine whenever I hear it. This is of course before the racey guitars and whirling synths come in. To me, this is easily one of the best songs that Rush ever wrote, and very few songs can top it.I wish I could have made this review a bit longer, but it seems fine the way it is. If I had to rank my favorite Rush albums, this one would round out my top 5. I see no reason to not give this 5 stars. Catchy, yet highly progressive and an absolute masterpiece."

          "text": "'Permanent Waves' - Rush (9/10)'Permanent Waves' represents a new stage in the band's development. Musically, the prog was starting to be melded with a new, more commercial approach. It is through this move that Rush experienced it's most commercially acclaimed period. 'Hemispheres' was obviously going to be a hard effort to top, but Rush was able to put together a record that while not beating it's predecessor, harbours a quality and flavour of it's own.The record starts with one of Rush's most well-known and radio played pieces, 'The Spirit Of Radio.' The guitar work for the signature riff of this song is intense, and is very hard to play. There is prog to be had here, but unlike 'Hemispheres,' which was content to go on along with it's long song lengths and comparatively uncommercial approach, there's also an optimistic radio-friendly sound on here... An AOR sound that helped Rush to become as popular and influential as they are. While commercialism generally is frowned upon (especially by prog audiences) there's no fault here, and it's done in such a way where it only makes the music more listenable.'Permanent Waves' is an easier album to simply sit down and enjoy, as opposed to '2112' or 'Hemispheres,' which needs a bit of audience participation and attention to really appreciate. It's music that can be played while driving, or while working out. There's good energy here (for the most part, songs like 'Different Strings' convey a more balladesque style.) The 'epic' 'Natural Science' unfortunately is probably the weakest epic Rush ever composed. Taken into consideration though is the fact that the song was written and arranged in a relatively short time (less than a week.) The production and sound effects on the song are very cool, such as the vocal effects towards the middle of the song. 'Natural Science' also has a strange evocation of progressive metal, despite the fact that the genre itself didn't come into major play until ten years later. The 'intense' part of the song sounds like a very fitting precursor to Dream Theater. If you listen to it, you'll know what I mean.'Permanent Waves' is worthy of five stars, but not an essential masterpiece of progressive music. Despite some very great songs, it has a comparatively less-strong middle section. A great prequel to the band's masterpiece however, 'Moving Pictures.' This album comes highly recommended, even if it's not as highly recommended as the masterworks."

          "text": "Permanent Waves is a huge leap forward from Rush's previous album, Hemispheres. In my opinion, this is Rush's masterpiece. It's really easy to hear the progress in the sound of different Rush albums. The synthesizer has a much bigger role than ever before, and its role will be even bigger on following albums. Musically this album is incredible. Alex throws some crunchy riffs and as a bassist myself it's undeniable that Geddy Lee's incredible bass playing is a very important factor for Rush's distinctive sound.The album kicks off with a striking intro of \"The Spirit Of radio\". This song is quite radio friendly, but a stunning piece nevertheless. The song features some groovy riffs, making it a very catchy piece. Another radio friendly track follows. \"Freewill\" is among Rush's very best. It features some catchy riffs and great lyrics. Don't let its radio friendliness fool you though, as the song is very complicated. In this stage of their career Rush relies less on epic tracks and more on shorter pieces, unlike on previous albums. Permanent Waves features two epic tracks though. The first of them is \"Jacob's Ladder\", an astounding piece of music. The song starts with a march-like rythm with some vocals on top. The vocals are scarce in this song, as it relies mainly on incredible instrumentation. After some ominous and heavy riffs, the songs takes a softer direction, only to slowly build up to a wonderful climax.The next song, \"Entre Nous\" was oddly issued as a single. In my opinion songs like \"Freewill\" would be much better candidates for this. Nevertheless, \"Entre Nous\" is a very good song, though probably the least interesting of the album. Next is a ballad called \"Different Strings\". The song is very mezmerizing and peaceful sounding. There is a melancholic undertone though. A fading guitar solo takes the listener to the sound of streaming water. An ambient guitar comes in and the absolute epic of this album starts. \"Natural Science\" is most definitely the most epic piece on the album. The song takes the listener through various parts and themes. From a soaring acoustic guitar introduction the song moves to what might very well be Rush's heaviest thing so far. This middle section of the song has been incredible important for inspiring the sound of several future prog metal bands. The third part of the song is much less agressive than the middle section, and takes us to the sounds of streaming water again, just to close the album in a brilliant way.Every time I listen to this album it's a wonderful experience. This truly is the absolute highlight in Rush's career. This masterpiece deserves five stars, and absolutely nothing less!"

While the album is admittedly short, even for vinyl standards, there is zero filler, as every second is infused with creativity and intelligence. Geddy Lee fires off some excellent bass parts throughout while sounding at his best vocally. Alex Lifeson mainly holds down the rhythm with some highly inventive riffs, yet does not at all disappoint when he takes off with a blazing solo. Neil Peart contributes with more \"in the pocket\" drumming on this album, as well as his ever-inspired lyrics. These lyrics are expertly penned, generally scientific and yet without coming across as pedantic.\"The Spirit of Radio\" One of Rush's radio hits, appropriately enough, this is a fantastic yet simple song. The music stays upbeat and the lyrics are brilliant. There's some difficult bass licks stuck inside this one, as well as a \"bristling\" guitar riff. More than anything, this is a fun way to kick off the album.\"Freewill\" One of my favorite Rush songs of all time, this piece has it all in a concise five-and-a-half minutes: A stellar main riff, intellectual lyrics, odd time signatures, a catchy chorus, a gritty bass solo that's all over the place, guitar shredding, and killer drumming. The words are some of the best and most thoughtful ever penned.\"Jacob's Ladder\" Steady bass, static keyboard, bright guitar, and a light marching snare over an 11/4 time signature make for an intriguing beginning. A synthesizer line, which sounds a bit like the main riff from \"Subdivisions,\" occurs halfway through, with Lee's voice recorded through some warbling effects. This is an extremely great example of restrained progressive rock music.\"Entre Nous\" One of the greatest overlooked gems in Rush's vast history, this one has a great opening riff and an equally great vocal melody. I love how the crunchy electric guitar during the verses is contrasted with the acoustic on the brilliant chorus. In addition, there's a basic synthesizer solo over more dynamic bass.\"Different Strings\" Yet another often unnoticed work of brilliance, this has soft guitar and a likewise gentle vocal performance. This (like \"Jacob's Ladder\" is a great example of how a virtuosic band institutes restraint.\"Natural Science\" I first heard this song live, and was floored when I did. It begins with watery sounds, simple acoustic guitar chords, and a galactic-sounding lead vocal. The lyrics are quite remarkable- some of the most meditatively scientific Peart has written. They compare a microcosmic world to the one in which we live. There are various sections to this lengthiest track, with different riffs that keep it fresh and invigorating. Lee's bass work during the excellent guitar solo implies a simplistic chord progression, but is incredibly vibrant. What an impressive way to end such a stellar album!"

          "text": "First Rush classic album ( ok, to be more correct - \"Rush middle period classic album\"if you want).I perfectly understand , that Rush fans are often divided into three groups. Some of them prefer Rush earlier sound ( in fact, hard rock with some prog elements, but heavy in screaming vocal,guitars and rhythm). I like some of their works of that period as well, but don't think that Rush will be known for a years because of that time music.Another listeners ( generally young generation) like Rush sound starting from \"Signals\", where they were more synth-driven group with some \"new wave\"elements. No guitar sound anymore. I don't like it at all, but believe, that some their albums of that period are even better than faceless boring neo-prog of the same period.As for me ( and I believe, there are plenty of proggers thinking like that) Rush golden period is short time starting from possibly \"Hemispheres\" and finishing with \"Signals\" . Excellent mix of heavy rock, complex art-prog, guitar driven multitextured sound and bright melodies. Albums are usually very focused, consists of songs,which are not too long ( often atribute of prog, but without nothing inside,just burning your time), not too short, just as its should be. Best compositions (incl. some perfect instrumentals), highest musician's form.So, \"Permanent Waves\"is album from that period, and album is good. Near their peak and one of the best album from american progresive rock of all times - \"Moving Pictures\".OK, there are still some unfocused moments, some longevities without serious reason, but generally very good album."

They shed most of the progressive tendencies that had defined the preceding albums and frankly, that was a good thing. Not because I don't likeFarewell To KingsorHemispheres, but because I think Rush would prove to be best at easy when writing in a more concise song format.It is a difficult album to rate. On one side, it is defining for Rush's career, it has some amazing songs of whichJacob's Ladderis the standout.On the other hand the album is a bit on the short side. When discarding the trite balladEntre Nous), I count 30 minutes. But also the other balladDifferent Stringsis hardly essential and reminds me of the filler tracks they had on 2112 and Farewell to Kings. The remainder of the tracks are very good but are featured abundantly on all live albums.On top of that the album sounds rather dry and lacks a bit of punch. And to give it a final blow here, the following albumMoving Pictureswould continue and perfect this style of Rush music. All those reason would point towards 3 stars.I guess it is justified to put it in between those two and your appreciation may largely rely on the moment when you picked it up. I picked it up in 1986 after I had heard all other albums from Rush's back catalogue and it didn't add much really.If you have followed a more chronological route, then this album will obviously be more defining and important. But I can't give 4 stars to a 35 minute album featuringEntre Nous."

          "text": "Transition album lacking the best of both stylesPermanent Waves was the transition album from \"epic\" period Rush of long, winding monsters like Hemispheres to the rock masterpiece of Moving Pictures. It is one of their highest rated albums on the site but I'm in the minority of reviewers who find it a bit on the uneven side. The first two tracks are pointing towards what was coming in earnest on the next release though neither match the quality in songwriting. \"The Spirit of Radio\" became a huge concert favorite for the band and \"Freewill\" contains some unbelievable chops by all three that still amaze me. Then comes the highlight which is the dark and brooding \"Jacob's Ladder.\" I just love the snare rolls Peart peels off during the intro. Then Geddy delivers the dramatic, stormy lyrics over the ominous rhythm with some nice keys in the background. It swells into a huge opus with some jaw dropping leads by Lifeson.Like my friend John I have memories of this era Rush which come flooding back when hearing songs like this. Side two is where things drop off pretty substantially with the mediocre \"Entre Nous\" and \"Different Strings\". \"Entre\" is particularly weak with its tiring chorus, \"Strings\" is a decent piece with interesting downbeat mood but nothing exceptional. The short album closes with its longest track \"Natural Science\" which despite some interesting change-ups and the usual great playing, doesn't get to where \"Xanadu\" or \"La Villa\" took us. Permanent Waves is certainly not a bad album and any Rush fan will appreciate it, but for me it's simply a good album. Each of the next three albums have held up better, and are more interesting and meaningful to me over the decades."

They were now free to \"move on\" to create the \"best songs\" they possibly could. Not the most complicated songs. Not the most impressive solos. The \"best songs\".While \"best songs\" is certainly a very subjective standard, I must concede that on \"Permanent Waves\" the songs are catchier, the writing more concise, the musicianship impeccable, the production professional, and the album a huge success.Rush doesn't abandon Prog territory as much as they refine, condense and distill it into a more compelling, concentrated form of album rock music. Each album side ends in a prog climax (Side One's \"Jacob's Ladder\" and Side Two's 3-part closer \"Natural Science\").Again we get under 36 minutes of music on the album. But there is no filler! It is no secret that Rush liked to compose a softer song in the studio \"off the cuff\" so to speak. But even \"Different Strings\" attains a delicate immediacy from Lifeson's passionate ending guitar solo.A supurb prog rock album, even if it does mark the begining of a new, streamlined era for the band."

          "text": "There weren't many bands from the 70's that clearly improved with the beginning of the 80's as much as Rush did. This album isn't as different from their previous work as I used to think, but itfeelsdifferent, and that means a lot for me. Yes, it's still largely tied to prog rock (I mean, it is a full length album with six tracks), and it's bombastic in places, but this album isnotjuvenile. It's very geeky in places, yes, and overly simplified philosophically in others, but Rush finally feels to me like it's grown up (or at least advanced further in puberty). The band has taken its core sound and made it more accessible, but without coming within a hundred miles of \"selling out\" or anything like that. It's my understanding that critics of the day largely knocked them for not coming up with a truly original sound, and that has a point, but the band came up with a plenty enjoyable stew of influences, so I'm not terribly bothered by this brand of new-wave progressive pop rock. The songwriting dips noticably in the middle, but aside from that, this is a very nice album, and definitely the band's best yet.The first two tracks are two of the best known, and best, tracks the band ever did. \"The Spirit of Radio\" does a lot of things well, and much of what it does mines familiar territory (the awesome \"rolling\" guitar riff, a lot of cool processed guitar noise in Lifeson's sound in the middle), but there are some nice new twists. There's a goofy (but great) reggae-ish section near the end (which was used in a Burger King Kids Club commercial in the late 90's), a repeated neat sequence where the riff launches itself off of some simple keyboard lines, a melody that actually has an effective pop feel, and even lyrics that I find very good (if a bit labored in the typical Peart way). Plus, the song has a feeling ofjoyI've never really felt in a Rush song before; it's so nice to feel such a friendly vibe when Geddy sings, \"Begin the day with a friendly voice,\" and I can feel that the band really has a love for good music and those radio stations that play it. Yup, this here is a great song.\"Free Will\" is a classic too, dagnabbit. The lyrics are dumb, yes, and the chorus just sounds a bit too much (both lyrically and musically) like what I'd expect to be the climactic song in a Broadway musical about the life of Ayn Rand, but it's still a great song. The basslines are ridiculously entertaining, the vocal melody is fun, the mid-song jam sounds interesting every time I hear it, and yes, I even like the chorus, despite myself. For better or worse, this song has become one of Rush's calling cards through the years, and I know that, were I ever to go to a Rush concert and not hear it, I'd be very disappointed.Unfortunately, the album gets noticably weaker after the second best opening 1-2 punch in the band's catalogue. I used to consider \"Jacob's Ladder\" close to the best song on the album, but I'm much less thrilled with it than I used to be, even though I consider it quite good and overly maligned by many. The song is basically Rush's interpretation of a lightning storm, not from within the storm itself (if so, it would be a lot louder and faster and more spastic), but rather from a distance, watching the clouds gather and lightning flash far away. From that perspective I find it to be quite atmospheric, menacing and even powerful; it has a lot of tension in its leaden, mid-tempo jamming, and the lyrics only enhance the experience and never detract from it. It's kinda boring in terms of not going anywhere and in terms of how few ideas it has, but those ideas are basically done well enough.The second side, honestly, starts as a bit of a disappointment for me, with two pop ballads that might represent new stylistic ground for the band but don't suggest it was a good direction for them. \"Entre Nous\" only has a decent introduction and that interesting melody with the \"Just between us, I think it's time for us to recognize\" part; otherwise, I find the song quite bland. I've listened to \"Different Strings\" plenty of times, and except for a single line in the middle, I've found it continues not to make any lasting impression on me. I don't hate the track, but I don't really like it much either.I like the album closer, \"Natural Science,\" way more than I probably should, though. One should always have a slight suspicion when Rush makes 9 minute songs, but I think this one is just magnificent. The lyrics are sometimes hilariously dumb (\"A quantum leap forward in time and space!\"), but the music is great. The acoustic intro is beautiful, the middle third is memorable, catchy and complex at once, and the final third is grandiose without being annoying. What else could you possibly want from a Rush epic? I could listen to this twenty times in a row and not get as sick of it as I do from one listen to \"Cygnus X-1.\"I find this album weaker than I used to, but it's still great by Rush's standards. It goes without saying that any Rush fan should have this, and even people who don't like Rush should have this in their collections."

          "text": "At about the time this album was released, my other favourite heavy /classic rock band, Rainbow, released the LP Down To Earth following the departure of Ronnie James Dio. The title was a deliberate attempt by Blackmore to signify to the world that sci fi & fantasy was now no longer needed, or, indeed, wanted. Songs, in future, would be rooted in the real world most mortals inhabited.Well, Permanent Waves is Rush's Down To Earth. This is the album where they ceased to amaze us with fantastical tales and myths, and, instead, got on with the serious business of moaning about the crap playlists on mainstream radio and other such important daily considerations. Consider the epic Natural Science, which closes proceedings. Just short of ten minutes long, it is a wonderfully tight, chirpy track which deals with the microscopic world and its science. Real life and real themes, all set within a wonderfully epic backdrop which easily holds together far better than the epic on Hemispheres, and yet is only half the length.A lot of people hated them for it. There are no tracks on this more than ten minutes long, but what they did was to pack as much action and adventure into the shorter songs than they did on much of what went before. The album even garnered a (shock, horror) hit single in Spirit Of Radio, still played on FM stations the world over and a classic Rush track.They did still, of course, stay true to their roots, and nowhere is this better exemplified by the cracking Jacob's Ladder, a track which would not have felt out of place on A Farewell To Kings. There is, though, a heavier reliance on Geddy Lee's synths, but the heavy riffs are pounding, and the live version on Exit Stage Left is, if anything, even more effective. They did, however, literally lyrically strip away the mystique and fantasy dragons on Different Strings, a lovely acoustic track featuring some marvellous piano work by Hugh Syme.With this stripped down album, we can, in hindsight, see the bridge between old Rush, and the sound that was perfected on Moving Pictures, and taken in a more \"modern\" direction with Signals and later albums.This was down as much to commercial pressures as much as Peart's wish to move outside of the band's mythical comfort zone. At the time, punk had done its work, and bands such as Motorhead, Saxon, and Whitesnake (to name a few) were belting out classic rock tracks which sold truckloads and captured the imagination of the buying and listening public. They did it with songs which lasted less than five minutes long.What Rush started to do with this album was to lay down the foundations of modern heavy prog with commercial nous. That they did so without selling out or losing their fanatically loyal fanbase was a testament to this great band's determination to face a new era positively, without fear, and retaining their credibility as serious artists.Four stars, but damned close to being a true masterpiece. That, of course, would be achieved with the follow up, Moving Pictures."

But listen to them, and you will notice a complexity that was rare in the other hard rock bands of their time. Odd time signatures, difficult instrument parts and some deep lyrics set Rush apart from their peers.Jacob's Ladderafter three decades is still one of my favorite Rush tunes.The second half of the album tones the music down a bit, withEntre NousandDifferent Strings. But both of these songs have a depth that make them compelling to me, as a prog fan. AndNatural ScienceCloses the album on a high and heavy note.Another must have album."

          "text": "A pattern so grand and complex, Rush's sound finds a new voice with Permanent Waves,mixing strong, accessible songwriting with admirable instrumentation. Clocking in at 35:40 minutes, Permanent Waves embodies the concept of \"short and sweet\", and oh how sweet this album is.Opening with \"The Spirit of Radio\" the album starts with a classic. Peart describes the majesty of music and the role the radio had, both good and bad. Lifeson's guitar sounds just like the radio waves themselves - giving off a sense of fluidity and a penetrable sound. The drums are complementary yet lavish, and tasteful bass licks are the sprinkles on top.\"Freewill\" is another acclaimed song from Rush. The lyrics can be looked at from an obvious point-of-view. Talking about freewill and how everyone should have their own voice in society, but beneath the surface their meaning can be about atheism. The drums are in the pocket, letting the killer bass and guitar solo shine.Like the clouds depicted in the song \"Jacob's Ladder\" ,the song starts off with an ominous and pulsing build-up, and then explodes into one of Lifeson's best guitar solos and continues with some great rhythm work. Geddy supports the song with strong thumping of his bass and keys that are as soothing as a staring off into the night sky. One of Rush's best and unique pieces.\"Entre Nous\" is a beautifully penned song by Peart. Talking about the need for two lovers to flourish on their own, but written in a whimsical way. It's quite the catchy song and all three members are great here.Writen by Geddy Lee, \"Different Strings\" is the shortest song on Permanent Waves. I believe this song is talking about the differences between people shouldn't tear them apart, and how they should remain together. The guitar remains the key point of the song, while the drums are subtle and are playing some accents with Geddy's bass.Tying things to a close is the monster \"Natural Science\". Opening with the section \"Tide Pools\", streams of water and gulls echo. The acoustic guitar and quite vocals enter and arrange for the next section \"Hyperspace\". Just like the title says, the section of the song has strong momentum and feels like you are being dragged throughout a cosmic anomaly. The drums are really great here, along with the ethereal keys. The bass is aerial and flies around for the entire arrangement, blowing your mind. Ending the piece is \"Permanent Waves\". The vocals are great, and are accompanied by a killer guitar solo, classic Geddy bass and air-drum worthy work by Neil.Overall Permanent Waves is an astonishingly consistent and accomplished piece of art. Highly recommended for any new Rush fan and anyone who wants to have an album that has both prog and radio quality songs.5/5 Stars."

          "text": "Having mastered the accepted conventions of prog rock on Farewell to Kings and the title track of 2112, and having taken them to excess on Hemispheres, Rush then set about changing the rules to suit their ever-evolving sound. Not a single song on Permanent Waves has a running time of more than ten minutes, but whilst Rush's revised sound is delivered in radio-friendly portions, the content of the songs themselves is as innovative and technically complex as ever.Musically speaking, this album sees the band sitting on the cusp between metal and hard rock, with hard rock winning out on most tracks but metal still creeping in here and there, usually when Alex Lifeson decides to get a little wild with his guitar (as on Jacob's Ladder). Neil Peart's drumming is, of course, whilst Geddy Lee breaks out some really excellent bass solos. Thematically, the band steer away from fantasy and allegory in favour of a more direct lyrical message - Freewill, for instance, is a song which proves that you don't have to be angry, accusatory, or downbeat to endorse atheism, whilst opening number The Spirit of Radio is a simple song about the love of music.But the real genius of the album is how all these ingredients, plus Rush's love of complex time signatures and so forth, is broiught together in perfectly formed little songs that are as catchy as hell, without sacrificing any of the complexity. Many other prog rock bands were trying to make their style more accessible at this time, but this was usually at the price of damping down the whole \"prog\" aspect of their music and leaning more towards a poppy, mainstream style. Rush were one of the few who accomplished a broadening of their appeal without compromising their musical vision, and Permanent Waves is the album they accomplished this on."

          "text": "Rush have a lot of fans outside of Canada who sing their praises and are highly regarded in the 'prog' community, but to your average Canadian they are just another rock band who gets played on the radio all the time. \"The Spirit Of Radio\" and \"Freewill\" are two songs which get played to death on Canadian radio (the country and dance stations are probably required by law to play these songs). Not only on the radio but you hear these songs at hockey games as well. You can't shake a stick in Canada without hitting some electric device playing one of those two songs. \"Closer To The Heart\" and \"Limelight\" are the only other songs that get as overplayed. (For what it's worth, you hear \"Subdivisions\" and \"Time Stand Still\" a lot too).The trio were starting to move away from both the extended song format as well as the more science-fiction oriented lyrics of previous albums. Their music was now more accessible and contained more contemporary influences. The record buying public responded by making Permanent Waves a huge chart success. It went to #4 in the US and #3 in the UK (#1 in Canada). Rush were now officially Canadian's Favourite Canadian Band, a title previously held by The Guess Who and later to be taken by The Tragically Hip. They are still using analog synths instead of the digital ones they will use in a few years. The proggy moments are still there but now there is more room made for shorter, more 'song' oriented tracks.\"The Spirit Of Radio\" was named after the slogan of the Toronto radio station CFNY. The lyrics mention the Concert Hall in Toronto. That section of lyrics is a parady of some of the lyrics from Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound Of Silence.\" Here you hear the beginning of the trio's New Wave and reggae influences, while the main riff shows their hard rock roots. I love Lifeson's guitar tones during this period. Nice piano at the end (if you blink your ears you will miss it). \"Freewill\" contains one of my favourite of Peart's lyrics: \"if you choose not to decide you still have made a choice.\" The best part of the song of course is the dual bass and guitar solos.\"Jacob's Ladder\" is the proggiest track up to this point; you can tell this is the same group that made Hemispheres (along with Geddy's vocals obviously). Love the subdued but effective keyboards. Always loved the build-up after the drumless section which features some of Peart's best playing on the album. \"Entre Nous\" is a more accessible and upbeat song that forshadows what Rush will sound like in the 1980s. Features a very simple but effective synth solo. \"Different Strings\" in places reminds me of another Canadian trio, Triumph. Another accessible song and my least favourite on the album. Always liked the blues-rock vibe they go into at the end; it fades out too quickly as Lifeson is just about to 'take off'.\"Natural Science\" is the best track and another proggy mofo. Nice use of natural(get it?) sounds. Features Lifeson's best playing on the album. Love that abrupt change into a harder rocking section after 2 mins...you never see it coming. Love the vocal effects but at one point there is some synth sounds that are annoying, especially on earbuds/headphones. They would only get bigger after this but also less 'proggy'. The two albums that bookend this one are my two fav Rush albums, but this is one I rarely play (mainly because I can hear the first two songs any time I turn on a radio). Overall this is a very good album but they have better albums. I'll give this a 3.5 and round it up to 4 stars."

          "text": "RUSH begins the new phase of their career with an in-yer-face advertisement in the form of \"Spirit Of Radio\" to begin their 7th studio album PERMANENT WAVES. This leading track not only signifies that they are now more radio friendly and ready to acquire a more diverse following in the process but also it incorporates all of the sounds that represent past, present (of the time) and future RUSH. Throughout their career they have always carried the hard rock torch on every album they put out but on this album they are the closest to a progressive metal sound with a heavy addition of synthesizers to add a thick layer of atmosphere. While they have not totally jettisoned their progressive songwriting prowess that reached its apex on the previous album \"Hemispheres,\" they have toned it down and packaged it into smaller digestible morsels that fit within the context of radio friendly hard rock. They also added newer 80s elements including hints of new wave and the inclusion of the offbeat and staccato reggae chords of Alex Lifeson.RUSH found enormous success with this album which honed all their talents and synchronized them giving music lovers something easily digestible and yet complex at the same time. A sound that would take them even further on the following release. The huge airplay that this received is one of the reasons I have neglected this album as I have heard songs like \"Spirit Of Radio\" and \"Freewill\" enough for a life time despite them both being excellent tracks. Despite the overplayed tracks this album has a few flaws that have always bugged me. One is that \"Jacob's Ladder\" has recycled parts of \"La Villa Strangiato\" that are just too obvious for my tastes. There are other less obvious borrowings from previous works as well. For whatever reason I just can't get into \"Entre Nous.\" I can come up with no reasonable explanation. It just creates a cognitive dissonance that I cannot reconcile. The real gem in my opinion is the final longer track \"Natural Science\" which like the leading track perfectly exemplifies the triumvirate of sound that RUSH featured on in the different stages of their career. The difference is that while \"Spirit Of Radio\" focused more on the newer sounds, \"Natural Science\" is kind of a respectful farewell to the old as not too many more tracks of this length would be included in their albums. An excellent but not outstanding album in my book."

          "text": "January 1st, 1980 was a very important day for Rush. After a large string of commercial successes in the 70s, Rush returned to the studio to work on their first album of the 80s, Permanent Waves. Not having released an album during 1979, many people were wondering what the band's new record would sound like; was it going to follow in the hard-hitting progressive rock and long-winded epics of previous albums, or would it signal a rebirth for the band's sound? Released on New Year's Day, you'd expect this to be a completely new phase for the band, right? Well, Permanent Waves certainly sounds a bit different from its predecessors, but it has that noticeable Rush familiarity in terms of overall sound as well.To be honest though, a mix of the old and the new is a great method for a band like Rush; it's interesting to hear them integrate the sounds of the specific era while retaining their progressive rock approach. Points of interest include: Geddy Lee toning down his voice (like the near-absence of high Robert Plant-esque wails), more synthesizer use, and more accessible arrangements. The latter point is the most notable one, considering that new wave was very popular at this time and Rush were heavily influenced by UK rock band The Police around this point. However, Rush were one of the biggest influences on The Police's earlier material, so the influence essentially became the influenced; it's pretty ironic to say the least. Anyway, no song goes over the ten-minute mark, so while you may consider album closer \"Natural Science\" an epic at 9:17, it isn't separated into individual segments like the previous epics by the band.Instrumentally, the music is a bit more conventional this time around. Despite heavy synthesizer use and the introduction of more eclectic rock elements (even reggae rock!), the overall sound is more reserved this time around. \"The Spirit of Radio,\" \"Different Strings,\" and \"Entre Nous\" are all mostly in 4/4 time with only a few variations rhythmically; the former in particular is a very tightly structured hard rock tune that switches frequently between a slow swinging rhythm and the driving guitar riffing that occurs around the verses. Nonetheless, the song is still fantastic as it seems to be a perfect mix of emotion, accessibility, subtle technicality, and anything else it may tie together. \"Freewill,\" despite its popularity, seems to be the real odd man out on this album when you get down to it. The sound of the verses is slightly sparse, mixing a mildly heavy guitar riff (syncing with the bass) with light guitar chord \"bursts\" as the drums are keeping everything in place. The 7/8 rhythm is also a bit off-putting initially as well, but it grows on you, as with the rest of the song.So with all of these details, what's the big reason the record's so good? The consistency. Even in the two \"epics,\" \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Natural Science,\" there's not much musical baggage to bring the record down. Nearly every note feels where it should be; the band also know when to space out their dynamics, such as how the acoustic ballad \"Different Strings\" follows the energetic rocker \"Entre Nous.\" The album's running time is only about 35 minutes, but the record feels completely satisfying at that length when you consider the replay value of each track. While the album is safer than some other Rush albums as I said, there are plenty of \"wow\" moments to offset the conventional ones. For example, the solo break in \"Freewill\" has Geddy Lee showing off his impressive bass playing with some exceptionally tricky runs as Alex Lifeson is adding his own soloing to the fray and Neil Peart is performing complex nuanced drum patterns underneath. It's cool to hear the interplay between every member of the trio as they play so technically and fluidly at once. \"Natural Science\" is a song full of surprises; the soft acoustic opening is pretty unexpected as it is, but a surprisingly heavy riff comes in after the main motif ends. Suddenly everything sounds frantic and tense as the song starts frequently switching between time signatures and tempos. It's stuff like this that combines well with the more accessible moments of the record, and it's a great balance all around.So yeah, this record is an awesome follow-up to Hemispheres. It's not as technical or intense, but rather a nice mix of accessibility, technicality, dynamic variation, and consistency. The amount of control on display is actually very beneficial to this album and that's why it works. However, the band had yet to really reach their commercial peak... as Moving Pictures would definitely prove."

          "text": "A permanent shift towards the radio waves?Stuck between the great \"Hemispheres\" and \"Moving Pictures\", \"Permanent Waves\" is RUSH's transition album from ambitious epic suites to more accessible songs. Released January 1st, 1980, this seventh studio opus makes the junction between their 70's neo-heavy-prog style and the more radio-friendly and electronic compositions the Canadians will develop in the 80's. Musically speaking, the synthesizers' presence is growing in the band's universe, and the trio slightly starts to incorporate elements from other genres, such as reggae. Furthermore, the lyrics become more oriented towards human nature, society and technology than fantasy and science-fiction. So, has RUSH abruptly left the progressive sphere? Don't worry seventies fans, this a transitional record, so there are still hard/heavy prog rock/metal pieces with complex rhythms structures, uncommon time signatures and changing atmospheres.The hit single \"The Spirit Of Radio\" is powerful and evolving. Simply rocks! In the ending section, RUSH even made their first (slight) incursion in the reggae territory, a style that they will further explore in their next three albums. The hard catchy \"Freewill\" is also quite nice and contains cool spacey guitar soli. However, the highlight of the disc is undoubtedly the somber progressive \"Jacob's Ladder\". Referring a meteorological phenomena, this track features multiple time signatures, epic riffs, oppressive metal passages and a spacey interlude. Great!On the contrary, \"Entre Nous\" (\"Between Us\" in English) is a much more conventional rock. Average and not very original, this is the weak song of the record. \"Different Strings\" is a kind of soft and melancholic ballad, with cover art designer Hugh Syme performing a piano solo. Enjoyable. The disc concludes with the 9 minutes \"Natural Science\", the longest track. Beginning with river and forest sound effects, this hard/heavy prog metal piece has a few futuristic moments. The ending, named \"Permanent Waves\", is quite heroic. A pleasant but somehow uneven mini-epic.\"Permanent Waves\" is definitively a transitional album, as well as a short one. Despite songs not as remarkable as its predecessor's and its successor's, the quality and inspiration are nonetheless overall constant and the trio's hard/heavy prog rock/metal is still efficient. Even if more accessible, the music should please all fans of the late 70's period of RUSH. Once again, the multiple breaks and complex time signatures may have influenced an important number of progressive metal bands.That's why there is finally no reason not to give it a listen!"

          "text": "I could almost call this review \"A Tale of Two Sides.\" Side A is vey good, whereas it's hard for me to reconcile the unfocused Side B as part of the same album.Permanent Wavesopens with \"The Spirit of Radio,\" five minutes of focused rock which richly deserves its status as an AOR classic. Another radio staple, \"Freewill,\" follows. Whereas the band would revisit and improve upon \"Freewill\" onMoving Picturesin the form of \"Limelight,\" there was no need to improve upon \"Spirit,\" and to their credit, they never recorded a \"Spirit of Radio part 2.\"The first side of the LP ends with \"Jacob's Ladder,\" which, despite some repetitiveness, accomplishes as much in seven and a half minutes as most of their \"epics\" do in nine or more - - epics including \"Natural Science\" here and \"The Camera Eye\" onMoving Pictures. The second section of \"Jacob's Ladder,\" which begins at its geometric center, opens with a synthesizer part reminding me (favorably) of \"The Remembering\" from Yes'sTales from Topographic Oceans, and at around five minutes, a rhythmic guitar part fades in which sounds Genesis-like, not all that different, say, from \"Eleventh Earl of Mar.\" By 1980, Rush's Led-Zep-fanboy days had been over for at least five years, and they were winding down a period in which their influences were still occasionally apparent. At some point, of course, Rush would establish a sound that would be much more influential than influenced.Side B begins with \"Entre Nous,\" a cringeworthy song even for Rush. Lyricist/drummer Neil Peart is occasionally saccharine, he really outdoes himself here on this plea for English- and French-speaking Canadians to sit down and try to understand each other because we're all brothers and life's too short and can't we be friends. OK, actually that's always been my interpretation; I don't actually have proof that this is the song's meaning. But the words are embarrassingly corny, and the music doesn't make up for them.While I think I can see what the band was trying to accomplish with \"Entre Nous,\" the last two tracks on the album are truly baffling to me. \"Different Strings\" occupies a place on the album suitable for a mellower song, or a softer or slower tune, and it delivers on these counts, but strikes me as uninspired - - it seems like the band had four minutes to fill but no creative raw materials to work with. Perversely, I would've preferred that they recycle higher-quality from elsewhere on the album - - as they appear to have done onSignalsby cloning \"Subdivisions\" to create the album-closing \"Countdown.\"Permanent Wavescloses with \"Natural Science,\" which a considerable number of people consider a classic work by the band. The first two of the three sections, \"Natural Science,\" to my ears, are as unfocused and uninspired as \"Different Strings\" was. I'll admit that things pick up a bit for the last section of \"Natural Science\" (entitled \"Permanent Waves\"). It's hard for me to tell whether these last two songs - - \"Different Strings\" and \"Natural Science\" - - represent poor composition or album padding, but either way, along with \"Entre Nous,\" they make up one of the weakest album sides on any Rush album.Whatever the case, twelve months after finishingPermanent Waves, Rush would enter the same Qu\ufffdbec studio with the same producer, and would create the greatMoving Picturesalbum.As is the case with nearly every Rush album, the production and the performances onPermanent Wavesrange from very good to excellent. But while the half of the material is strong, the other half is tough to sit through. At three songs and 18 minutes, Side A would've been a four-star EP. Consider getting their 1981 live albumExit...Stage Left, which has all of the songs from the first side ofPermanent Waves, and, perhaps tellingly, none from the second.(P.S.: I wonder if now, forty years later, the guys in Rush cringe a little at the cover of this album. Duh, they have every right to have whatever image they want on the cover, and yeah, it's not pornographic at all - - I get it. But I wonder.)"

Thereafter, sounds like a song lifted by Spinal Tap for their 1985 mockumentary before switching to a little more disciplined version of a Led Zeppelin song for the instrumental passage in the second and third minutes. A sparse, slowed down passage in the fourth minute, which builds and eventually comes back to a protracted jam that ends with a return to Geddy's singing for the finish. Not bad. (13/15)4. \"Entre Nous\" (4:37) a solid construct with little emotional impact until the instrumental section in the third and fourth minutes. (8.75/10)5. \"Different Strings\" (3:48) one guitar being picked while Geddy sings. This sounds like a template and precursor to many of the hair band hit ballads in the 1980s. Greatly engaging chords, palette, and construct. My favorite song on the album despite the bluesy lead guitar solo at the end (that, interestingly, gets faded out).

Permanent Waves (8.25/10)Total Time 35:25All in all, an album of solid compositions, very solid performances, that definitely show the band's development and maturity as both instrumentalists and songwriters since their earlier days. But, in the end, this is not the kind of music that draws me in or even interests or impresses me. (I have, after all, heard lots of Yes, McLaughlin, Zappa, Area, PFM, Banco, and RTF. These guys are tight but nowhere near as impressive as the former. As we say, \"Nothing to write home about.\")B/four stars; an excellent contribution to prog world and a solid indicator of this trio's evolution into the icons that they've become."

          "text": "Permanent Waves is one more demonstration of the excellent state of form of Canadian virtuosos, incorporating some less harsh sounds and new wave touches to their progressive proposal. It is thus that the keyboards that Geddy Lee alternated with the bass, acquire greater weight and begin to look at Alex Lifeson's guitar riffs more closely, challenging part of their prominence. On the other hand, Neil Peart's percussion does keep the same old line, a master class on how to play the drums.The album unfolds with a lot of vitality, from Alex Lifeson's meandering guitars in the festive and captivating The Spirit of Radio, a brushstroke of reggae in between and crowned by the interaction of an audience that responds to the challenge, through the epic and hypnotic Jacob's Ladder that reminds us of a biblical passage from Genesis, up to the final and indisputable jewel of Permanent Waves, the magnificent and super progressive Natural Science, ideal for the instrumental display of the trio in the 3 sections that compose it in their most of 9 minutes, being this one of the last extensive pieces of Rush (the last one ended up being The Camera Eye of the mega-successful Moving Pictures).In between, the dynamic and more digestible Freewill and Entre Nous, and the delicate and at times inconsequential ballad Different Strings, perhaps the most debatable song on this great album. The duration of these three pieces would be the example of the new standard from now on, themes not so extensive and more direct, leaving little by little the intricate conceptual developments.Permanent Waves implied one more evolution in Rush's musical career, they extended their horizons into new territories, but without neglecting or betraying their essence. Excellent work starting in the eighties."

          "text": "With this album Ruhs renew their sound, making it more concise and synthetic, and adding some synths and some more rhythms. In fact we are faced with conventional rock songs of which only two are long.1. The Spirit of Radio (4:56). First song that made the fortune of Rush for the rhythm, the stadium choirs and the reggae verses. It would seem an exercise in fusion but Rush have never managed to gradually, coherently and inventively blend acoustic pieces with electric ones, as well as different genres of music: also in this case the reggae verses are simply alternated with the rock ones, without a real fusion. The piece is still very pleasant and interesting. Rating 7,5/82. Freewill (5:21). Catchy rock song verse chorus. Rating 7,5.3. Jacob's Ladder (7:26). It is the long song of the first side, which has the rhythm of a march, but soon an acid electric guitar solo arrives (one of the best parts of the LP), then the song becomes very repetitive, until the interlude with the synths (to the delight of the prog audience without great pretensions), even this very repetitive, then arrive at a sung ending. Song not entirely successful. 6.5 / 7.Side B 4. Entre Nous (4:37). Conventional hard-rock song verse-chorus, quite catchy, solo left to synths (the only prog part of the piece). In fact, Rush are a hard-rock group who write quite commercial songs but with a very high technical and songwriting rate. Rating 7+.5. Different Strings (3:48). Acoustic beginning: and it's always nice to hear Lee's voice when he's not screaming. The song continues slowly, and then becomes an electric ballad that fades without a real chorus or a solo. Song not finished compositionally, a wasted opportunity. Rating 6+. The weakest piece of the Lp.6. Natural Science (9:17) - i. Tide Pools - ii. Hyperspace - iii. Permanent Waves It begins with noises of flowing water, very prolonged, then slowly it goes in electrical progression (the best part of the piece), then comes a syncopated, almost cybernetic piece. At about 3 minutes and 45 seconds the rhythm changes and the welcome guitar solo arrives. At about 5 minutes the third movement arrives, very rhythmic, but rather boring and with continuous exhausting stop and go. The piece does not take off, it remains very forced. Last 45 seconds of fade. Part not completely successful. Rating 7.Medium quality of the songs: around 7. Honest but even modest album. Two and a half stars."

          "text": "Rush has got to be the smartest band in the 80s. While yes in the 70s to the 80s, their sound of course became a tad more synthy in a way, they still stayed true to their hard rock music, due to the fact that hard rock was big in the 80s, so why change it? I feel like this album perfectly encapsulates what hard rock was in the 80s and how Rush evolved with that decade.Permanent Waves starts off with the amazing first track, The Spirit of Radio. I'd say, other than Tom Sawyer and 2112, this is the perfect opening track for any Rush album. It's powerful, it's epic, and it's cool. It has all the right beats, riffs, and flow, plus it has a very cool music video. Afterwards, Freewill comes in, a great song to enjoy with your friends in a car while on a road trip. Speaking of which, this album is basically the perfect road trip jam. It's fun, it's groovy, and it is extremely enjoyable. The last song on the album, Natural Science, is a amazing ballad. It starts off slow and acoustic, and then it builds up speed instantly when the electrics and drums comes in. The more the song goes on the more powerful it is. It's an incredible song by the band.All in all, this album, like many others, is downright incredible, and proves this band can stand on it's own in the decade of the 80s without straying away from their roots too much. I love it."

          "text": "Review N\ufffd 804\"Permanent Waves\" is the seventh studio album of Rush and that was released in 1980. This album marks a distinct transition from the lengthy conceptual pieces of music, into a more accessible, radio friendly style and consequently, a significant expansion in the group's sales with hits like \"The Spirit Of Radio\" seeing considerable radio airplay. While there was short, complex and cerebral songs hadn't come close yet to fruition until the release of \"Permanent Waves\".\"Permanent Waves\" represents the third studio album of the band that belongs to their second musical phase. The other studio albums of that musical phase are their fifth studio album \"A Farewell To Kings\" released in 1977, their sixth studio album \"Hemispheres\" released in 1978 and their eighth studio album \"Moving Pictures\" released in 1981.The line up on \"Permanent Waves\" is Geddy Lee (lead vocals, bass guitar, Oberheim polyphonic, Mini Moog, Taurus pedal synthesizer and OB-1), Alex Lifeson (electric and acoustic six and twelve string guitars and Taurus pedals) and Neil Pearl (drums, timpani, timbales, orchestral bells, tubular bells, wind chimes, bell tree, triangle and crotales).\"Permanent Waves\" has six tracks. All lyrics were written by Neil Pearl, except \"Different Strings\" that was written by Lee and the all music was written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson. The first track \"The Spirit Of Radio\" is lyrically a very curious song. It laments the commercialization of the music industry and the devaluation of the true artists. But very ironically, this critique of commercial radio was itself a commercial hit. However, though it's a song written for the radio it has so many time signatures and genre changes that makes of it a great song and in one of the band's most famous songs. The second track \"Freewill\" is another one of their most popular songs, but like its predecessor, is technically also great. Both songs have a very conventional structure. However, filled with great guitar playing, and an awesome bass line you can see that although these two songs, which were singles, Rush chose not to be lazy with them, and which is certainly the main reason why so many Rush progressive fans love these two songs. The third track \"Jacob's Ladder\" has something enigmatic on it. While the sound belongs to the Rush songs in the 80's, something here has the taste of the hidden and unique flavours of \"Xanadu\" or the finest musical moments of \"2112\". This is Rush making their best, and it became for me in one of their finest songs, mostly because of its hybrid sound. This is, without any doubt, a great song and is perfectly in the same line of their best tracks. The fourth track \"Entre Nous\" has also something special. It's a kind of a love song but in an original progressive shape. Even if the sound doesn't reach a musical level of excellence, it's good enough for mainstream dudes, especially because of the more familiar musical structure that it contains. It goes extremely well from times to times and it's very catchy, somehow. The fifth track \"Different Strings\" is also a song with something special like the previous song, despite being the weaker track on the album. Although, this means not that the track is a bad one. Simply, this is a very simple song that stays in a more old fashioned way of doing music, despite masterful drumming, which is always usual on any Rush's album. The sixth and last track \"Natural Science\" is divided into three parts \"Tide Pools\", \"Hyperspace\" and \"Permanent Waves\". This is the lengthiest and epic track on the album and is definitely the great highlight of \"Permanent Waves\". Not only the concept here noteworthy, but the music and the atmosphere created as so fitting of its title. Again, with this track the progressivity in Rush's music gets to the highest point, with an atmospheric future that starts like flowing and that grows bigger and bigger all over the track. This song represents one of their finest musical moments. It's truly a pity that this was one of Rush's last epic tracks. This particular track is one of the reasons why Rush is considered a progressive rock band, really.Conclusion: \"Permanent Waves\" worthy perfectly well to have five stars. However, it isn't at the same level of the best masterpieces of the progressive rock music like \"A Farewell To Kings\" and especially \"Hemispheres\" are. Despite some very great songs, it has a comparatively less strong middle section. So, it isn't the most cohesive or consistent of all Rush's musical works. There's an undeniable dissymmetry between the giant progressive rock tracks and the clean straight forward pop rock songs. Still, any lack of overall cohesion is overshadowed by the sheer quality of the songs in and of themselves. As \"A Farewell To Kings\" offered an onslaught of some new musical ideas that were then unified on \"Hemispheres\", \"Permanent Waves\" is a transitional album and the breeding ground for countless new musical ideas that will be perfected on their next studio album \"Moving Pictures\". Anyway \"Permanent Waves\" is a great album and one of the best musical efforts of Rush. My sincere wishes were that Rush returned to creating more epic tracks on their new studio albums like they made on this album and on those previous albums. It's a pleasure to hear and review albums like this. \"Permanent Waves\" should be in your progressive musical collection because it's an excellent album.Prog is my Ferrari. Jem Godfrey (Frost*)"

          "text": "Rush entered the new decade with a more than brilliant release in the face of their expansive, epic work 'Permanent Waves', an album that marks a strong creative achievement along the greatest run of albums for the band. With just six tracks in rotation, Rush deliver a more concise but quite straightforward piece of work that tries to experiment with more radio-friendly arrangements and sounds, while necessarily preserving the progressive spirit, felt enormously on every single track on here. 'Permanent Waves' marks a shift in the way Rush albums sound, which might be attributed to the better production and the overall step up for the band in terms of writing and performing the material. A certain sense of maturity engulfs this album, which amazed with the taste for balance and control over the compositions.Already expanding the scope of their music on preceding albums and trying out various instruments and mainly synths and synth pedals, Rush do not shy away from trying our a variety of styles on 'Permanent Waves', exuding a sense of musical eloquence that perhaps was not so obvious on previous albums. The listener will see them trying out some radio-friendly arrangements on 'The Spirit of Radio' and 'Freewill', a format the band is familiar with as well as some very complex, unpredictable and epic compositions, occasionally much darker than the usual Rush tune, in the face of the two main highlights on here 'Jacob's Ladder' and 'Natural Science', both of which are just too good. The tasteful solos of Alex Lifeson, the upfront menacing bass picks of Lee and the all-over-the-place drumming of Neal Peart all make this album quite special, everything fits perfectly and works as an excellent LP with several moments of true progressive greatness. 'Different Strings' is another excellent entry, while 'Entre Nous' provides a nice counterbalance to the heavier, more menacing tones."

          "text": "Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Why do I have to rate this three stars... Wow, I mean, this could have been one monster of an album. As it is, it's still a great entry and, in my not so humble opinion, ranks as one of Steve Hackett's best albums. But didn't he 'proofread' or, at the very least, get the inkling that maybe, just maybe, some of the 'vocals' on this album needed 'improving'? I very much enjoy his singing. His vocals are very sincere and heartfelt. But sometimes he delivers a very weak vocal. Now this album ain't what you would necessarily call full on 'prog', it's sort of a mongrel mix, with almost half the album being progressive rock instrumentation, with three intrumentals and two songs that are half instrumental (like the Genesis SONG Abacab, the second half is all intrumental). The remaining four and two-halves seems dedicated to 'stadium-rock' or the like, which was popular at the time. 'Give it away' - wow, this sounds JUST LIKE Boston, complete with Tom Scholz style guitar and Steve's vocals even sound a bit Brad Delp. Sure, we ain't talking about prog, I get that, but this is ONE BLISTERING rock n roll cut that would have made any AOR band mighty proud. 'Wieghtless' - this is a far more laid back song and feels nice. I don't know exactly what to compare it to... it could be a complex ballad for an AOR band or someone like 10 CC, but I just know it's really nice... 'Cell 151' - sadly, this is the closest thing Steve ever got to a 'hit', It'd have been great if he'd had a few hit singles. The best things about this song are the second half full of excellent, progressive rock instrumentation (including a brief snippet of what would become 'Matilda Smith Williams') and Steve's dedicated vocal delivery. The main part of the song is VERY MUCH like Trevor Rabin territory. Then, there is of-course, the three instrumentals 'Hackett to pieces', 'Always somewhere else' and the best one, 'Group Therapy', all worthy songs, though not as hard-edged as, say, 'Please don't touch' or 'Slogans'. Everything seems fine, so why oh why was I complaining before about giving this album three stars? A bunch of great rocking songs, progressive enough when it needs to be, top notch songwriting, surely it's worth at least a four. Well, 'Walking through walls' is a fine, shuffling rocker' with insistent beat, good to sing along to the chorus, but the vocal is very weak and ruins the song. 'India rubber man' is a truly second rate track. The title might or might not be a reference to the famous Ritchie Havens song 'Indian rope man'. The comes the most frustrating song 'Camino Royale'. It's not only the most progressive sounding vocal track here, with some mesmerising instrumental sections, but it's also THE MOST CATCHY. The chorus is dang infectious 'Only the fool / learns to get through' (I think that's what Steve says). But a rather weak and mumbled vocal delivery, and buried under instruments, ruins the thing, rather than shining and making it probably the best song on the album. So, it's a semi-spoiled prog meets arena rock masterpiece.

      "name": "MAGMA",
      "genre": "Zeuhl",
      "country": "France",
      "biography": "Founded in Paris, France in 1969 - Disbanded in 1983 - Reformed in 1996\n\n\u2b50 Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2009 \u2b50\n\nMAGMA is a progressive group led by drummer/composer/vocalist\n\nChristian VANDER\n\nthat has been active in the 'classic period' and in the 21st century. The music of MAGMA is often categorized as 'Zeuhl' (which means 'celestial' or 'heavenly' in Koba\ufffdan, MAGMA's own language). The band doesn't clearly fit in any other progressive subgenre, although avant-prog would qualify, and it has a significant vein of jazz-rock fusion running through the discography. Additionally, Magma has played the RIO (Rock in Opposition) fests which gives it certain RIO credentials.\n\nSwirling riffs in odd time signatures, theatrical choir arrangements, heavy and distorted pulsing bass guitar, bombastic and minimalistic (sometimes both at the same time), dark and brooding, adventurous and angelic, jazzy or classical, but always with the highly innovative and original drums of founder and main composer Christian VANDER, those are just some of the ways to describe the music of Magma. While the music of MAGMA is adopted by the progressive rock movement, even for progressive standards it can be very hard to get into because of its 'other worldly sound' and its extended compositions of often more then thirty minutes. Reputedly the band had had almost no connection whatsoever with other bands of the Prog genre, although in France it would prove to be a big inspiration for other Fusion and Zeuhl bands. It is often thought that the modern classical music of Carl ORFF (for instance Carmina Burana) must have been a big influence on MAGMA. VANDER himself has claimed on several occasions that his main influence was the jazz saxophone player John COLTRANE, and listening to COLTRANE's version of 'My favorite things' we do find finds of what was to become the Zeuhl genre. Legend goes that MAGMA was formed after Christian VANDER experienced a dream involving the vision of a spiritual and ecological future for mankind. This vision would influence the three different multi-part saga's, namely the Koba\ufffdan saga (debut and 1001 Centigrates), the K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz triology (Kohntarkosz Anteria or K.A., K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz and \ufffdm\ufffdhnt\ufffdhtt-R\ufffd) and the Theusz Hamtaahk triology (Theusz Hamtaahk, Mekan\ufffdk Destrukt\ufffdw Kommand\ufffdh or M.D.K and Wurdah \ufffdtah). The third studio-album of MAGMA, M.D.K., is often seen as the genre defining Zeuhl album, whereas the first two MAGMA albums have stronger jazzrock/fusion leanings and less Orffian choir arrangements.\n\nBeing heavily disturbed by his vision, classically trained drummer and composer Christian VANDER formed the first version of MAGMA in 1969 in Paris as a means to give musical expression to his fears for humanity. With a small list of fusion and rhythm and blues musicians, among them some wind-players and one of MAGMA's main vocalists; Klaus BLASQUIZ, the band created a double concept album heavenly drenched in fusion, avant-prog and modern classical music. In order to be fully capable of expressing the artistic vision of the band all lyrics were written in Koba\ufffdan. Vander would later state that \"when I wrote, the sounds [of Koba\ufffdan] came naturally with it - I didn't intellectualize the process by saying \"Ok, now I'm going to write some words in a particular language\", it was really sounds that were coming at the same time as the music.\" The debut album would tell the story of a group of Earthlings that start a new civilization on the planet Kobaia in order to be able to live in harmony with nature whilst using advanced technology. The second half of the record tells of a rescue of an Earth space vessel. The saved Earthlings are amazed with the Koba\ufffdan society and ask for help in order to save planet Earth, which by that time is plagued by man-made disasters that threaten the survival of the planet. The Koba\ufffdans decide, after some discussion, to send a small party to accompany the Earthlings back home.\n\nThe second MAGMA album, '1001\ufffd Centigrades', was released in 1971 and showed the band becoming more professional and tight. Meanwhile, the compositional skills of VANDER had grown, which resulted in the first lengthy MAGMA piece 'R\ufffdah Sah\ufffdltaahk ' - this can be seen as a step toward what would become the Zeuhl genre. On the second side the music has a strong jazz-rock/fusion feel, whilst keeping faithful to the avant-prog sound of the debut album. The album chronicles the arrival of the Koba\ufffdan delegation on planet Earth and their imprisonment. As a reaction to this the Koba\ufffdan civilization threatens to use their ultimate weapon, which is likely to be reason for the title of the album.\n\nIn 1973 the band would return to the studio to record 'Mekan\ufffdk Kommand\ufffdh'. The recording was refused by their record company, which resulted in the recording of 'M\ufffdkan\ufffdk D\ufffdstrukt\ufffd\u1e81 K\ufffdmmand\ufffdh' (M.D.K.) in the same year. The discarded recording was later released by Seventh Records in 1989 and can be seen as a rawer version of M.D.K. with a bigger emphasis on drums and without the wind-section. 'M.D.K.' is often cited as a milestone for rock history because it is the first album to feature the signature sound of MAGMA and it can be seen as the foundation of the Zeuhl genre in general. Whereas the wind-section would be less jazzy, it would prove to be a very powerful tool in giving the music an imperial and dark feel, only to be further enriched with female choir arrangements over repetitive piano motives in daring time signatures. This made 'M.D.K.' one of the most bombastic and daring records of the seventies. On 'M.D.K.' Christian VANDER's wife, Stella VANDER, would make her entry and would from then on be an important member of the band. Former bass-player Francis MOZE was replaced by Jannick TOP, who would add the heavy distorted bass-guitar sound to the Zeuhl style. His influence on MAGMA would rise the coming years, which makes him a co-founder of the Zeuhl genre for many of its listeners. The story-line would continue with Nebehr Gudahtt, a prophet heavily influenced by Koba\ufffdan philosophy who prophesies 'Theusz Hamtaahk' (Time of Hatred), which would be the name of the trilogy of which 'M.D.K.' would prove to be the closing piece. As the crowds march in anger against Gudahtt, they start asking existential questions. This results in sympathy for the prophet's words and people start marching with him instead of against him, thereby averting doom.\n\nIn the 1974 Christian VANDER would work on a soundtrack album for the avant-garde film 'Tristan and Isolt', by Yvan LAGRANGE. The album features a stripped down version of MAGMA, consisting of piano, drums, bass and vocals. Whereas the album was released as a Christian VANDER solo-album, it is nowadays perceived as a full-blown MAGMA album under the name of '\u1e80urdah \ufffdtah' (Dead Earth), being the second movement of the 'Theusz Hamtaahk'-trilogy. The first movement of the trilogy, the title track, was never recorded in the studio and would make its first appearance on the 1981 live album 'Retrospektiw I'. Nowadays the '\u1e80urdah \ufffdtah'-album is an acclaimed MAGMA record in which VANDER shows the band can be equally impressive with a smaller group of musicians, making a very well composed Zeuhl album that has its distinct place within the discography of the band.\n\nIn the same year MAGMA would release a studio album under its own flag, the dark and brooding experience called 'K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz'. VANDER would embark on a new chronicle, this time about a man called K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz who enters the tomb of an ancient master called \ufffdm\ufffdhnt\ufffdhtt-R\ufffd, who died whilst reaching for immortality. In the tomb K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz receives a vision in which the master his secrets are revealed to him. In the next year the band would release the double live album 'Live' (otherwise known as Hha\ufffd or K\ufffdhntark) on which a reworked version of K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz would be played in its entirety. This live album is often seen as one of the best live-albums of the progressive rock genre because it shows the unmatched precision and professionalism of the band on stage. Quite frankly, the level of musicianship and interplay is almost unbelievable. On this live-album bass-player Bernard PAGANOTTI would make his entry, though he and Jannick TOP would both make contributions to the upcoming record.\n\nIn 1976 the band's direction changed. With the progressive movement on its decline, MAGMA decided to make an album '\ufffdd\ufffd \u1e80\ufffdd\ufffd' with shorter songs on the first side and one dark avant-garde epic 'Du Futura' on the second side. From now on the band leaves very few clues for a story-line, although on the record's sleeve one can find a description of the story of 'Du Futura'. Other band-members would contribute on the song-writing, with pieces of PAGANOTTI & BLASQUIZ, VANDER and Jannick TOP (who would write both 'Ork's Sun' and 'Du Futura'). 'Du Futura' is seen as a classic MAGMA creation, with its dark pulsing bass-lines, grooming vocals, striking minimalism and unearthly style. The other tracks feature different styles and hints to them, such as spiritual music, ghost-house music, world music and even some disco-rhythms do appear. The synthesizer would make its entry into the sound-mix, though its minimalistic use is quite distinctive. After a VANDER & TOP tour bass-player TOP left the band, which led to the entry of Guy DELACROIX on the 1978 'Attahk' album. The album has seven pieces and is perhaps the most diverse MAGMA album, whilst fans might point out that MAGMA's former balance and vision is strongly on the decline (though others will argue this was already the case on '\ufffdd\ufffd \u1e80\ufffdd\ufffd'). VANDER would sing the lead-vocals in a very extravert and experimental way and funk, gospel, eastern music can be found amongst the material. Both '\ufffdd\ufffd \u1e80\ufffdd\ufffd'' and 'Attahk' are plagued by their muddy recording quality and blessed by the open experimental mindset of the band at the time. MAGMA was disbanded after 1978.\n\nIn 1984 the much debated 'Merci' was released under both the MAGMA and the Christian VANDER flag. This album features tracks full of soul, disco and funk influences and a typical eighties production. Though neglected by many fans of the band, others point out it's an album that can be enjoyed once perceived as a product of its time. In 1990 Seventh Records was founded, a record-company owned by VANDER that would release several live albums from the classic period as well as new releases to come.\n\nIn the year 2001, MAGMA-fans from all over the world celebrated the return of the band and the live document \ufffdTheusz Hamtaahk\ufffd was released, covering the complete trilogy played live. Quickly the band regained a top-notch reputation giving gigs of unbelievable precision and intensiveness for the avant-garde public. The new reincarnation would feature Christian VANDER, Estelle VANDER, guitar-player James MAC GAW, bass-player Philippe BUSSONET and a short list of male and female vocalists.\n\nThe highly acclaimed 'K.A.' Followed in 2004. This album consists mainly of pieces that already had been released on some live-albums dating from the classic line-up. The style, sound and feel of the album is remarkably faithful to the sound of classic era MAGMA. The album is the first piece of the K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz-trilogy and chronicles the summoning of K\ufffdhntark\ufffdsz towards the tomb of \ufffdm\ufffdhnt\ufffdhtt-R\ufffd. In 2009, the third part of this trilogy would be released, '\ufffdm\ufffdhnt\ufffdhtt-R\ufffd', which proved to be a strong continuation artistically as well as a good entry-point for newcomers to the Koba\ufffdan saga.\n\nIn the years 2006-2008, the band would set out to play and record MAGMA pieces from throughout their career in a live setting, resulting in four volumes of live-footage of all MAGMA-era's with appearances of former band-members such as Jannick TOP and Klaus BLASQUIZ. This \ufffdMythes Et L\ufffdgendes\ufffd series was extremely well received by fans of the band and proved that the band could still faithfully reproduce all its pieces, even the avant-prog/fusion pieces from the first two albums. Personally I would qualify this as one of the biggest achievements of progressive music in general.\n\nIn 2012, the band released the short album \ufffdF\ufffdlicit\ufffd Th\ufffdsz\ufffd with a completely new 30 minute Zeuhl piece. This album stands out as the most accessible and optimistic feeling album of the band, whilst still being as well-composed and played as other 21st century recordings of the band.\n\nIn retrospection... In the end we still don't know whether the fearful dream that was the starting point for the story of MAGMA is to become reality. Yet it had led to one of the most artistically and technically well developed musical movements of 20th & 21st century music. MAGMA is attractive for its imagination, for its untouchable larger-then-life atmospheres, and for its fearless artistic attitude. Looking back on writing this biography, I think I can state that what makes the band different from all other bands in the world is that some bands gave us extended song-writing, others gave us new atmospheres to dwell into, but MAGMA gave its music a self-invented cultural framework from which the music can be perceived. MAGMA-fans themselves turn into Koba\ufffdans -- for at least as long as the music takes, tuning into the imagination of Christian VANDER: the man who was a drummer, vocalist, composer, and perhaps above all, a musical social architect.\n\n: : : Friso, Netherlands : : :",
