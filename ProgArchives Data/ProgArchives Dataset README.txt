# ProgArchives Dataset README

For our purposes, we only care about the following
recording type: Studio & Singles/EPs/Fan Club/Promo
Title
Artist
Genre
Record Type, Year, Ratings
individual artist names and instrumentation
Reviews by progarchives members
Descriptions/Biography of artists/bands

ProgArchives does not have a genre tag system, so we will have to use their subgenre system as a complement to our existing tag system. This will be somewhat aided by the descriptions of the subgenres, which can be found in this directory. Their subgenre must be treated as a separate "parent" tag that can also have similarity relations with our other genre tags.
There is very likely to be significant overlap between ProgArchives album data and our Progressive Rock/Metal CSVs, this must be accounted for.
