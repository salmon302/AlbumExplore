## Project Goal

*   AlbumExplore is a tool designed for exploring and analyzing music album collections, with a particular focus on advanced tag management.
*   

## Key Features

*   Advanced tag analysis and normalization.
*   Smart tag variant detection and consolidation.
*   Hierarchical tag relationships.
*   Pattern-based tag similarity detection.
*   Single-instance tag handling.
*   Tag co-occurrence analysis.
*   GUI interface for collection management.
*   

## Overall Architecture

*   The system likely involves a data storage component (possibly a database, given the presence of `alembic`), a tag processing engine, a GUI, and potentially integration with external data sources (like ProgArchives, based on file names).
