fb6c,RUSH,Canada,Heavy Prog,,,artistfb6c.html?id=609,,,,,,"Formed in Toronto, Canada in 1968

RUSH are a pioneering line-up of Seventies Progressive rock, who influenced many Prog, hard-rock and heavy metal bands. This Canadian band is composed of bassist, singer and keyboard player

Geddy LEE

, guitarist

Alex LIFESON

and renowned drummer Neil PEART. In 1974 John RUTSEY was replaced by Peart who also assumed the role of the band's primary songwriter. Acclaimed for their instrumental virtuosity, their lyrics and longevity, throughout their 40+ year career they've proved to be the masters of their respective instruments while creating challenging yet popular music. They have the record for the third most consecutive gold or platinum albums for a band on the US album chart behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.

Now, a brief summary of the band's career ...

Through the history of RUSH, they have passed through many distinct phases. Every one of these phases represents a triumph in music, allowing the band to move on. As at the end of all of RUSH's phases, a live LP was released. This tradition began with ""All The World's A Stage"", recorded live at Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada. Since then, the group has released three additional live albums: the best selling ""Exit... Stage Left"" (1981), ""A Show of Hands"" (1989), and the three-disc set ""Different Stages"" (1998), which encompasses three decades of the group's music.

FIRST PHASE (1974-1976):

In the beginning, they started off as hard rock blues outfit with John-boy before he left and Neil came in, bringing his sci-fi mind into the works. The music seems to be a transition between straight-ahead rock tunes and more complex progressive tracks. ""Caress of Steel"" is a landmark album in the history of RUSH. Lyrically and musically, ""2112"" was a masterpiece. This multi-platinum release remains one of RUSH's best-selling albums.

SECOND PHASE (1977-1981):

They moved headlong into progressive rock in the later part of the decade, starting with the album previous and right on to their massive breakthrough, 1981's ""Moving Pictures"".  Synthesizers were now employed by the band, played in the studio and on stage by Geddy. This was the end of transition from long epic pieces to shorter, more concise, and intricate songs. ""Permanent Waves"" is widely considered to be second only to ""Moving Pictures"" as RUSH's finest achievement.

THIRD PHASE (1982-1989):

RUSH embraced the 1980s sound with ""Signals"", making heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards for the first time in the band's history. Keyboards have become a very large part of the music, and the interplay of guitar, drums, bass, and keyboards became technically almost impossible to play live. The two LPs that followed, ""Grace Under Pressure"" and ""Power Windows"", also followed nearly the same mold. They reached the zenith of its keyboard experimentation with ""Hold Your Fire"".

PRESENT PHASE (1990 to today):

Moving to a new label, RUSH embarked on their present phase with ""Presto"". So, after mercifully ending their synth period, RUSH went into a sort of pop/rock phase for this stage in their career. They sought to remove the dominance of keyboards in the music, and go back to a bass-drum-guitar sound. But after their tour for their 1996 record ""Test For Echo"", the band took six years off before returning in 2002 with the release of their new album ""Vapor Trails"". In 2004 they released a covers album, ""Feedback"" to celebrate the band's 30th anniversary in the current lineup. A tribute to Rush's early influences it contains covers of such luminaries as ""Cream"", ""The Who"" and ""Blue Cheer"".

Since their 30th anniversary the band has seen a major resurgence in popularity with the release of ""Snakes & Arrows"" in 2007 and the critically acclaimed concept album ""Clockwork Angels"" in 2012. In 2013 they were inducted into the ""Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame"" to complete their journey towards critical mainstream acceptance."

Pioneers of the second wave of progressive rock

The Early Years

After some early line-up changes, the first recognisable incarnation of the band was complete by 1982, with

FISH

(real name Derek William Dick), a charismatic Scottish frontman vocalist,

Steve ROTHERY

on guitars, Peter Trewavas on bass, Mark Kelly on keyboards, and Mick Pointer on drums.

The band built their reputation the old-fashioned way by gigging extensively, but their profile was also raised by some clever manipulation of the music press, especially journals such as Sounds, in which Fish often interviewed his proposition that the band were ""prog with attitude"", a new force for the post-punk era.

This profile landed them a record deal with EMI records, and, in 1982, they released an EP Market Square Heroes, which, it is fair to say, had more than a passing resemblance to the Genesis classic, The Knife. Also appearing was a monster prog track called Grendel.

However, it was the release in 1983 of their debut long player, Script For A Jester's Tear, which brought them to the wider attention of the rock world. The album spawned hit singles in Garden Party and He Knows You Know, was critically well received, and reached number 7 in the UK album charts.

The band's progress and workload were relentless after this point. They proved themselves to be somewhat merciless in the pursuit of musical and commercial success by ditching Pointer, who was felt to be sub-standard, and replacing him eventually with, after what the band described as their ""Spinal Tap"" period for drumming, Ian Mosley, formerly of The Steve Hackett Band. Pointer went on to jointly form Arena, a classic neo outfit who still record today, and still tours his Script era version of Marillion. The difference Mosley made, though, both live and in the studio, was palpable.

The line-up released three more albums; Fugazi, Misplaced Childhood, and, finally Clutching At Straws.

Misplaced Childhood was a massive hit, reaching number 1 in the UK charts in 1985, and responsible for huge hit singles in Kayleigh, Lavender, and Heart of Lothian. By this time, Fish had ditched his trademark face paint, - the music and his sheer personality were a tour de force in themselves, with no need any longer for gimmicks or theatrics. This spell of activity culminated in a huge open-air gig in front of tens of thousands at Milton Keynes Bowl, supported by, amongst others, Jethro Tull, themselves no strangers to large concerts.

Clutching At Straws was released in 1987, and was an altogether darker affair, inspired by colossal drink and drug use by Fish, in particular, and discussing the many complex personal issues that brought. The relentless touring continued, and EMI were eager for the band to release a quick follow up. The pressure of this was too much, and in 1988, Fish left the band to embark on a solo career which, it is fair to say, had mixed success.

The Hogarth Years

For many acts, losing such a charismatic and important frontman and lyricist would spell the death knell. Not, however, for Marillion.

In 1989, they announced to the world that

Steve HOGARTH

, a vocalist formerly with little known The Europeans, would be Fish's replacement. It is a little-known irony that Fish, when appearing on a BBC personality programme discussing his favourite music tracks, had actually played a Europeans single whilst still with Marillion.

It is a testament to this inspired choice that the band have recorded and toured constantly, with latterly increasing success again, with the self-same line-up for (at the time of updating this biography) 28 years, an incredible achievement.

The debut album released by the line-up was Season's End, released in 1989. Much of the music had been recorded prior to Hogarth's arrival, and it showed. It charted, though, at a respectable number 7 in the UK.

The follow up, Holidays in Eden, was, perhaps understandably, criticised by fans and the press alike, as a misplaced attempt to create a commercial rock album driven by the desire to have hits. Whilst it did not bomb, also reaching number 7 in the charts, it certainly did not sell in the numbers of its predecessors, and the band found themselves playing to (admittedly ultra-loyal fans attending) mid-size venues of 3,000 such as Wolverhampton Civic Hall, rather than the larger arenas of the late Fish era.

The band fought back, though, releasing in 1994 (three years after Holidays) the seminal concept album, Brave. The lyrics behind the music were inspired by a story Hogarth heard on local radio concerning a young lady who had committed suicide by leaping from Bristol Suspension Bridge. Although obviously dark and brooding almost throughout, the album was a statement of intent by a band determined to plough their own furrow in the music world. In later years, the album has been critically praised, and it also spawned a rather arty film of the same name.

EMI, though, dropped the band, and the final album released with the label at the time was Afraid of Sunlight, released in 1995. It only reached number 16 in the UK charts, and sold relatively poorly. It was not much compensation when, upon reviewing the album on release, Q Magazine pronounced boldly that if any other band than Marillion had released this work, it would be a monster hit worldwide. At this time, prog had a bad name again, and the band suffered because of it. Further, more than one member of the band has wondered what would have been had they renamed themselves upon Hogarth's joining. There has been some wonderful recognition of the storytelling and emotional music inherent in the album when the family of Donald Campbell, famously killed in an accident on Coniston Water in a speed record attempt, following the discovery of his body in 2001, asked the band to perform Out of this World, a track from the album inspired by Campbell, at a memorial service.

Marillion signed for Castle Records, and went on to record three albums with them, these being This Strange Engine, Radiation, and Marillion.com. The band, though, became increasingly unhappy with the poor marketing strategy, and lack of understanding of the music, by their record company, and they parted ways, with no real prospect of a new deal anywhere else in prospect. Once again, the band found themselves on the cusp of disaster.

Disaster was averted, as Marillion set the template for all the crowd funded, internet based, music recording that is so widespread in the second decade of the millennium. Put simply, they asked their fans, still incredibly loyal, to fund the recording of Anoraknophobia before even a note had been recorded. 12,000 fans responded, EMI agreed to distribute it, and survival, on the band's terms, was ensured. This incredibly far sighted decision was not just the beginning of a return to relative commercial success, but also the template for many other more niche acts to follow.

Marbles, released in 2004, a very well received album with genuine classic progressive tracks, had its marketing funded by the fans, but also had a double cd not commercially available to those who pre-ordered. Again, it was a tremendous success, and the band even enjoyed a return to the top ten singles charts with You're Gone, even if an appearance on Top of the Pops was denied them.

At the time of writing this biography in 2017, the band have released five more albums, all with increasing commercial success, and continuing to use the fanbase as the model for funds and publicity, together with a more sympathetic press tiring of overtly rubbish commercial pop music. In 2016, the album F.E.A.R. (the acronym being f**k Everyone And Run) was released to large critical acclaim, and marked a return to overtly political lyrics and anger not really witnessed since the halcyon days of Fish ranting against war and Thatcherism in equal measure. It caught the zeitgeist of the times extremely well, that of a tired world increasingly bewildered by greed, corruption, poverty, the loss of traditional England, and an inability by the country's (and world's) politicians to deal with such issues effectively. It peaked at number 4 in the UK charts, having been funded by a Pledge Music campaign, and in October 2017 the band achieved a lifetime ambition of playing live at London's Royal Albert Hall. Tickets sold out within three minutes of being on sale.

Marillion can be said to epitomise the tradition of progressive rock, playing, at times, incredibly complex music, but with an attitude and ethos wholly grounded alongside their fanatical fanbase. People reading this biography should not be fooled, or put off, by the neo-prog label attributed to them on this site. Marillion are far more than that, and they proclaim it very proudly.

VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR is an English eclectic progressive rock band with front man

Peter HAMMILL

from 'the classic period' that has proven be one of the most important bands of the progressive genre.

In England, 1967 Chris Judge SMITH formed 'VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR', but after his departure it was up to Peter HAMMILL (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Hugh BANTON (organ, bass on organ), David JACKSON (sax, flute) and Guy EVANS (drums) to become one of progressive rock most proliferate and unique bands as well as the first band to be signed to the Famous Charisma Label. The band was named after the scientific instrument 'the Van de Graaff generator', which is used for accumulating high voltage bolts. VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR (VdGG for short) is known for its extrovert dynamics (ranging from slow, calm & peaceful to fierce & heavy), its intense and emotional 'love it or hate it' vocals by Peter HAMMILL, its celebrated contribution to extended progressive songwriting and its combination of psychedelic, jazz, classical and avant-garde or even acid influences. Moreover, VdGG can be seen as the first band that was to combine the very progressive with the very personal, whereas other bands used to work with abstractions and fantasy. Peter HAMMILL has a talent for singing out intense graving, anger, panic and confusion whilst still being able to sing warm and caring in other passages. The band never really fitted in the symphonic progressive rock subgenre because of its widespread influences and unique style, though the band would have symphonic leanings throughout it's career. Unusual for the time was the focus on organ, drums and sax, whereas in the sixties the guitar and the bass guitar had played a major role.

The band had a leading role in the very first progressive phase releasing high-rated albums from 1970 to 1975. The strong conceptual 'H to He Who am the only one' (1970), the intense and highly innovative and daring 'Pawn Hearts' (1971), the bleak and ever evolving 'Godbluff' (1975) and the matured 'Still Life' (1976) are often cited as masterpieces of the progressive genre. Alongside VdGG there would be a very interesting solo-career for Peter HAMMILL who frequently invited members of the band to come and join on his seventies recordings, some of which are seen as 'lost VdGG albums'. VdGG would directly influence a lot of Italian progressive acts, a country in which they were particularly well received. The band stopped performing in its classic line-up after 1976, not to return until 2005.

The first VdGG album (though without David JACKSON) 'The Aerosol Grey Machine' was actually intended to be the first Peter HAMMILL album, but was recorded under the VdGG flag due to contractual constrictions. Only the last song 'Octopus' would feature what fans think of as 'the VdGG sound' whereas most of material could be perceived as late-coming sixties psych with some progressive and even proto-metal (due to the heavy bass riffs by Keith ELLIS) leanings. The album was recorded in two days and didn't sound very professional, but listened to as a sixties psychedelic rock record it stands quite well.

In 1970 the band released 'The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other' which introduced the VdGG sound with intellectual songwriting, lot's of slightly distorted organs and intense dark passages. Moreover, wind-player David JACKSON would join in to complete band with his double sax playing. At this time the band would gather itself a cult-following, though significant commercial success would never be reached in England.

The second 1970 release, the strangely named 'H To He Who Am The Only One' (the first words referring to the chemical reaction in the sun) would show the band having grown towards brilliance with the best of lyrics about troubling solitude by Peter HAMMILL and great epic songwriting in 'The Emperor in his War Room' and the celebrated 'Pioneers over C'. The latter would take visual and philosophical songwriting to a new level. In the studio King Crimson front-man Robert FRIPP would join to add some guitars to the mix. Due to the departure of Nic POTTER the bass would be played by organ-player Hugh BANTON for halve of the album and on tour.

In 1971 the band would return with an even more daring and adventurous recording, the much anticipated and revered 'Pawn Hearts'. Psychedelic darkness was taken to the maximum with not a single passage left untouched by inspired heavy progression. This would make the album both a favourite and one of the less liked classics of the progressive genre. The album would feature the 23 minute epic 'A Plague Of Lighthouse Keepers'. After this album Peter HAMMILL would focus on his solo-career releasing 'Chameleon In the Shadow Of The Night' (1973), 'The Silent Corner And The Empty Stage' (1974) and 'In Camara' (1974) with much participation of other VdGG members. These albums are considered to be great progressive records by most fans of VdGG. The VdGG recordings that were made during these years would be released as 'Time Vaults' (1982).

The year 1975 would bring us the return of VdGG with the classic 'Godbluff' that would have four ten-minute long epics showing a complex, but less freely psychedelic VdGG. The instrumental and lyrical development of these four songs is phenomenal and the before-mentioned dynamic range of the band was stretched to the maximum. After that the band was quick to record 'Still Life' (1976) on which the band's sound matured with a more solid production. In 1976 the band would also record 'World Record' which is often seen as a regression with three less progressive tracks on side one and a strong epic 'Meurglys III, The Songwriter's Guild' that was plagued by a long aimless jam-session towards the end. Later this year Hugh BANTON quit VdGG and he was soon to be followed by David JACKSON, because of the problematic financial situation of the band.

In 1977 the band was revived with the return of

Nic POTTER

on bass and the addition of Graham SMITH on the violin. 'The Quet Zone', otherwise known as 'The Pleasure Dome' showed a different band with a different sound. In 1978 the band's first live album was released, the double lp 'Vital' with David JACKSON appearing as a guest musician and the addition of Charles DICKIE on cello and synth. Due to a different line-up and a different zeitgeist (the rise of punk) the sound would again differ from the classic VdGG sound, which would have a distinctive effect on most songs. After this Peter HAMMILL would once again focus on his solo-career.

The return of the Generator with the classic line-up would be a main event of 2005 for the progressive community with the well received 'Present' (2005) and the celebrated 'Real Time' live-album which would feature great live-recordings of most of the bands progressive classics. The first concert in the Royal Festival Hall in London (where 'Real Time' was recorded) would be visited by fans from 32 countries with black-market tickets rising to a staggering 1000 dollars on Ebay. After the departure of David JACKSON they would record 'Trisector' in 2008 and 'A Grounding In Numbers' in 2011. In 2012 the band is releasing yet another new album as a trio, 'ALT'.

Retrospection. VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR has always remained too small to be a widely recognized act (like for instance Genesis or Yes), yet it was too big to get an illustrious title as ' underground band'. The band acquired some devoted following over the years and is nowadays considered to be one of the biggest acts of progressive rock history, as the amount of reviews and debates on PA can underline. For lot of us their music has proven to be very hard to get into, but it is even harder to live without it once you've acquired a taste for the band. The way the band combines the very personal with the abstract sound of progression creates a fascination that lives on and the way Peter HAMMILL puts his soul in the music seems to be untouchable for other musicians.

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2019 ⭐

What's the difference between a band and a cult band? A charismatic frontman, able to seduce the audience with a single look? A mastermind, conducting his fellow geniuses to sheer excellence? A dedicated and addicted following lasting three decades? An outstanding live concept combining stage charisma, true emotions and self-ironic humor?

Take it all, add a catalogue in which every new entry is described as ""the latest masterpiece"" and you get IQ.

Rising from the ashes of

THE LENS

in 1981, the original line up of Peter NICHOLLS, Michael HOLMES,

Martin ORFORD

, Paul COOK and Tim ESAU formed a band achieving the impossible - the combination of such diverse styles as prog, punk, jazz and even reggae. Their first cassette album, later re-released on GEP as ""SEVEN STORIES INTO 98"", is still an outstanding example of that.

Both their first vinyl albums ""TALES FROM THE LUSH ATTIC"" and ""THE WAKE"" gained instant classic status in the ""new wave of British progressive rock"". Soon the band became a regular in London's world famous Marquee club, performed more than 200 gigs each year in the UK (as seen in the ""LIVE FROM LONDON"" video from 1985), and quickly attained a strong and loyal following.

After signing to POLYGRAM in 1987 with new singer Paul MENEL, they released ""NOMZAMO"" featuring the single ""PROMISES"" which made it high in the Dutch charts. European tours and the album ""ARE YOU SITTING COMFORTABLY?"" followed, but MENEL and bass player Tim ESAU left the band shortly after in 1989.

What could have been the end was in fact just another beginning. NICHOLLS rejoined and was welcomed back enthusiastically at concerts in London and Paris. At the same time GEP was founded by musicians and associates of IQ with the rarities album ""J'AI POLLETTE D'ARNU"" becoming the label's debut release.

In 1993 IQ's new album ""EVER"" thrilled fans old and new with a modern and yet traditional interpretation of progressive rock. With new bassist John JOWITT (ex-ARK) the band embarked on a storming tour of the UK and mainland Europe, and played acclaimed festival appearances in the USA and South America. The tour was captured on film at the celebrated ""FOREVER LIVE"" show in Kleve and was released in a special box set featuring video, double CD and large booklet.

In 1997, IQ released ""SUBTERRENEA"", a classic double concept album with a very fresh approach which amazed both critics and fans alike. Brought to the stage with a stunning visual show, featuring moving lights, moving screens, films and theatrical action, it set standards not only for IQ but for all of their contemporaries in the prog world.

Just when everybody thought IQ couldn't push it any further, again the band convinced the public with new album ""THE SEVENTH HOUSE"" (2000), shortly followed by a 2 disc live DVD ""IQ20"" filmed at the band's 20th anniversary show in London.

Both ""THE SEVENTH HOUSE"" and ""DARK MATTER"" (released in 2005) are musical gems, featuring some of the strongest songs IQ have written. Another double live DVD ""STAGE"" (featuring new drummer Andy EDWARDS) captured the Dark Matter tour with two complete gigs on both sides of the Atlantic.

Early in the writing sessions for 2009's ""FREQUENCY"" keyboard player Martin ORFORD left the band and was replaced by Mark WESTWORTH. ""FREQUENCY"" proved to be another highlight in an outstanding career and was presented to a large audience in the UK, Germany, Holland and the USA.

2010 saw the 25th anniversary of IQ's classic album ""THE WAKE"", an occasion marked by a very special limited edition 4 disc deluxe box set of this fantastic album.

Another change of personnel in 2011 meant that 4 out of 5 original members were once again in IQ when Tim ESAU and Paul COOK came back to the fold, joined on keyboards by Neil DURANT (SPHERE). They celebrated that year with a series of gigs to mark the band's 30th anniversary.

In April 2012, on the 15th anniversary of ""SUBTERRANEA"", GEP released the acclaimed album on vinyl for the first time, with all new artwork and deluxe packaging. The first 500 copies included a free 12"" single containing 2 songs that didn't make it onto the album. The band marked the occasion by re-staging the original show in full, updated with improved technology and production values.

For 2013 Mike was able to celebrate the 30th anniversary of IQ's first album ""TALES FROM THE LUSH ATTIC"" with a completely new mix from the 24 track masters, which was released in both 2 disc hardback book and gatefold heavy duty vinyl editions. This was shortly followed by the vinyl release of the band's 1993 album ""EVER"" on vinyl.

2014 sees the release of IQ's eleventh studio album, ""THE ROAD OF BONES"", supported by live performances in the UK and Europe. It was officially launched at Islington's Assembly Hall on May 3rd and has received unanimous praise across the board.

2753,RIVERSIDE,Poland,Progressive Metal,,,artist2753.html?id=1287,,,,,,"Founded  2001 in Warsaw, Poland -

Despite not being the biggest progressive rock powerhouse of Europe, Poland have certainly sprouted great and interesting progressive bands since the heyday of progressive rock, being the biggest examples of that the singer and multi-instrumentalist Czeslaw Niemen and the supergroup

SBB

. After the fall of the communist regime, during the 90's and 2000's, more bands begun to form and release their material, strengthening the country's own progressive rock scene, such as the neo prog bands Abraxas and Collage, and Riverside is, quite possibly, the biggest and best known band to come out from that scene.

Riverside was formed almost by accident, when two of its members, the guitarist Piotr Grudzi�ski and the drummer Piotr Kozieradzki, listened to Marillion in Kozieradzki's car back in 2001. Both played in heavy metal bands at the time, but had the common interest for progressive rock, so they decided to join with their mutual friend, Jacek Melnicki, who owned a studio, and started to experiment with progressive rock. Mariousz Duda, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist from the band

XANADU

, joined the trio later that year for rehearsals and the results and reactions from those meetings were extremely positive. After some more rehearsals, and the completion of some compositions by the band, Mariousz started to take the role as both the band's vocalist and bass player.

In late 2002, about one year after the band's formation, Riverside's was already playing gigs in Warsaw with material that would later be their debut album, Out of Myself, and, after distributing 500 copies of their demos around the town, the band played in a small club in Warsaw by the end of the year.

In 2003, shortly after the recording of Out of Myself, Riverside's founding member and keyboard player Jacek Melnicki decided to leave the band to focus on his own studio, so the rest of the band continued to mix and produce the album, as well as to search for a replacement for Jacek, which would be the band's current keyboardist Michal Lapaj.

Upon its release, in late 2003, Out of Myself had an unexpected success in Poland, and such success led to the album's rerelease in September 2004 by the American record label Laser's Edge, which led to even bigger media coverage and even more praises and attention towards the band. Still on 2004 the  band had its first gig outside Poland in the Progpower festival in the Dutch city of Baarlo. The crowd's response was so good that they sold out all CDs they had on stock. Still in 2004 they began to work on their EP Voices in my Head, in an attempt to keep their momentum in Poland and ready their fans for their upcoming release. The EP was released in early 2005.

Marillion played an important part in Riverside's history: the band was one important element in their very formation and Riverside's first three albums, their debut foremost and their second and third albums in a minor degree, are hugely influenced by Marillion, specifically the Fish-era Marillion.

Finally, still in 2005, the band signed with the record label InsideOut and was able to rerelease all of its previous works to the international public and could release the upcoming album (at the time) in late 2005, which is Second Life Syndrome. The album was an even bigger success than the debut, allowing the band to play for the first time overseas at NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on June 24, 2006. Second Life Syndrome is considered as the band's breakthrough album, since it was responsible for most of Riverside's international attention, such as the invitation to play at the NEARfest and the title of one of the best albums of 2005 by Dream Theater's drummer Mike Portnoy.

By the release of their third album, entitled Rapid Eye Movement, in late 2007, Riverside was considered one of the big progressive metal band of the world. The tour they did supporting Dream Theater in the Fall of 2007 and the release of Rapid Eye Movement stretched the band's horizons even further and widened the band's fanbase. The album was considered by Classic Rock Magazine one of the 10 essential progressive rock albums of the decade. Rapid Eye Movement has two different release packages: the standard album and the double album, containing both the original album and a bonus disk, containing material from the 02 Panic Room Single and two new and unreleased songs.

In 2008, despite the lack of fresh material, Riverside released its first proper live release ever and it is entitled Reality Dreams. The album was recorded during a concert performed in Lodz. Also in late 2008, Mariousz Duda released an album by his project called Lunatic Soul.

2009 was a bright year for Riverside. Despite the bankruptcy of SPV, the owner of InsideOut, the band was able to release their newest album, Anno Domini High Definition, on schedule and have more success than ever. The album debuted as the leader of Polish charts and went gold on Poland, after selling over 10 thousand copies in Poland alone and seems like nothing will stop it from also claiming international recognition. Anno Domini High Definition also represents a major change of direction for the band: from the mellow and introverted mix of progressive rock and progressive metal they did until Rapid Eye Movement to full blast energetic, fresh and surprisingly original progressive metal. With their latest release, the band apparently found their own unique signature sound. The album, much like what happened with Rapid Eye Movement, have two different release packages: the standard album and the double album, containing the studio album and a live bonus DVD, recorded on December 2008 at Amsterdam's Paradiso club.

The year of 2010 seems to bring surprises as well, as Mariousz Duda announced the release of the second album from his project Lunatic Soul, what could be yet another fine release by one of those fine polish progheads.

Peter Joseph Andrew Hammill

- Born 5 November 1948 (Ealing, West London, England)

Peter HAMMILL is one of the most unique and influential voices in prog. He was the pivotal figure in VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR (VDGG for short) who formed in 1967 at Manchester University. His obsession with lost love, lost faith, time, space and existence itself are the cornerstones of both his work with the band and his solo albums. He was also their principle songwriter.  The classic line-up was the HAMMILL, Banton, Jaxon, Evans combo which produced the peak ""Pawn Hearts"", ""Still Life"" and ""Godbluff"" albums. He has since brought out at least 30 solo albums, marked by lyrics of the utmost insight (usually) and a total refusal to compromise. Their complex music, as often brutal as it was lyrical, fitted somewhat uneasily into the once and then niche of Progressive Rock. An interesting figure whose albums certainly merit investigation..!

The first of a classic trilogy in progressive rock history, ""Chameleon""... and its companion pieces ""The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage"" and ""In Camera"", are as good if not better than many of the VDGG albums. FOR FANS OF PETER HAMMILL...!

e544,BACAMARTE,Brazil,Symphonic Prog,,,artiste544.html?id=494,,,,,,"Bacamarte biography

Founded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1974 - Disbanded in 1984 - Regrouped Live  in 2012 and 2014

This was a Brazilian septet including Mario Neto (guitar/vocals), Sergio Villarim (keyboards), Delto Simas (bass), Marco Ver�ssimo (drums), Marcus Moura (flute/accordion), Mr. Paul (percussion) and Jane Duboc (vocals). A rich and symphonic music with wonderful keyboards and a very nice flute which enlightens the compositions full of interest and detours. A few female vocal interventions complete to enrich this great work. The band surpasses their influences: LOCANDA DEL FATE, PFM, QUELLA VECCHIA LOCANDA and ILLUSION.

They made two albums entitled ""Depois Do Fim"" ('83) and ""Sete Cidades"" ('99). In '95 Rarity Records released their first LP on CD with the addition of a bonus track (due to appear in their second LP). The CD ""Depois Do Fim"" is one of the highlights of the South-American Prog rock: a compelling blend of varied keyboards (vintage synthesizers, strings, piano, organ), skillful acoustic and electric guitar and strong Portuguese vocals. The nine compositions (four instrumental) sound warm and elaborate with many changing atmospheres. I'm mostly impressed by Mario Neto's alternating guitar play: from powerful and howling electric guitar to a slight Andalusian touch and classical like JOHN WILLIAMS (Sky-era) or using the tremolo-technique on the Spanish guitar (like ""Recuerdos de la Alhambra"" from TARREGA). Not to be missed by any serious Prog rock aficionado!

6a70,PLANET X,United States,Jazz Rock/Fusion,,,artist6a70.html?id=387,,,,,,"Planet X biography

Founded in USA in 2000 - Disbanded in 2012

PLANET X started as a solo project of keyboardist

Derek SHERINIAN

, who left

DREAM THEATER

in 1999 after recording one album with the band. He immediately started to work in a solo album, in which he invited talented drummer Virgil DONATI as a guest musician. The result was so satisfying that the couple decided to make a new project and build up a formal band.

The band took the name of that first solo album of SHERINIAN, PLANET X, and invited legendary guitar player and studio musician

Tony MACALPINE

to join the band. The mixture of these different styles gave for result an instrumental rock band with tendencies to jazz/fusion, Hard rock and progressive. The chemistry of the three talented musicians brought an impressive level of skills, time signature changes, heavy riffing and back to back soloing in which the band shows a huge level of musicianship.

They published their first album ""Universe"" in 2000. The success and acceptance of the album, especially between prog metal fans and instrumental followers made possible a tour in 2002. During this tour, the band recorded a live album called ""Live From Oz"". Soon after the tour, the band rejoined in the studio to bring out their most acclaimed album: ""Moonbabies"". Keeping the spirit of the first album, now improved and better oriented their second album it's their own masterpiece, very popular and successful.

The different compromises of the players made them stay in hiatus until 2007, when the band decided to release their third album, now having talented jazz guitar man

Allan HOLDSWORTH

and Brett GARSED replacing MACALPINE. The name of the album was ""Quantum"".

Later, in April of 2009, MACALPINE announced his comeback to the band but there's, as of yet, no official information of the next release of the band.

PLANET X has participated with other great guest musicians such as: Billy SHEEHAN, Tom KENNEDY, Jimmy JOHNSON, Brett GARSED and Rufus PHILPOT.

f9d3,BLUE EFFECT (MODR� EFEKT),Czech Republic,Jazz Rock/Fusion,,,artistf9d3.html?id=1493,,,,,,"Blue Effect (Modr� Efekt) biography

Founded in Czechoslovakia in 1968 - Disbanded in 1990 - Reformed from 2004 to 2016

Lead by ace guitarist Radim Hlad�k, BLUE EFFECT were one of the major progressive bands in Czechoslovakia; they were to their own country what OMEGA were to Hungary, or SBB to Poland. They started out in 1968 with a couple of early R&B-oriented albums. However, the Czech governement strongly disapproved of English names at the time, so the band switched to MODR� EFEKT and later to simply M.EFEKT. After these two albums, their material veered towards jazz rock and by the early 80's, following sereval personnel changes, their music had become a little less prog, more accessible. They released their last album in 1981 and then quietly disappeared.

Of particular interest to prog fans are three albums: ""Modr� Efekt & Radim Hlad�k"" (1975) which features an energetic mix of YES-like symphonic rock with some fusion; the overall effect will likely remind you of FINCH or CRUCIS. Emphasizing Hladik's brilliant soloing, this was the album that established him as ""the"" Czech guitarist par excellence. However, it is ""Svitanie"" (1977) that is considered the band's true masterpiece. With its sinewy bass lines and bold keyboard/guitar melodies, it is still quite YES-influenced but it also has a definite Czech flavour that makes it unique. Finally, there is the bolder, more complex and not so YES-like album titled ""Svet Hledacu - World of Searchers"" (1979); this one is characterized by many sudden tempo shifts and emphasizes the flux between the spacey synths and Hladik's biting guitars. Except for this album, whose 5 official tracks are all sung, the band's r�pertoire is mostly instrumental.

Primarily recommended to fusion lovers but YES fans will also likely find something to sink their teeth into.

PORCUPINE TREE are incredibly hard to describe because their music doesn't fit into any one genre. I like the description on the back of the album ""Signify"" (one of my all time favorites). It says ""Porcupine Tree have managed to defy genres and blend together numerous ambient, rock and avant-garde styles to create a musical landscape that is both refreshing and compulsively seductive"". The great post-GONG revival which gave birth to OZRIC TENTACLES now brings us PORCUPINE TREE. The hypnotic rhythms, spacy synthesizers, glissando guitar and crazy voices which made the style successful are all contained here.

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2005 ⭐

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2007 ⭐

The band started as a solo project of singer-songwriter-guitarist

STEVEN WILSON

who, back in the early nineties, released a series of increasingly spaced-out ambient excursions. PT is one of the most innovative bands in prog today combining intense musicianship, unconventional composition and superb studio production. They are unquestionably one of the UK's most inspired and inventive rock groups.

The bands 4th studio album from '96. ""Signify"" saw Porcupine Tree truly gell as a studio band producing a blend of psychedelia, heavy rock, melancholic pop, kraut rock, and wild experimentation that brought the best out of each band member. Their latest two albums (""Stupid Dream"" and ""Lightbulb Sun"") move the band further away from their influences and into their own catagory, by which other bands eventually will be compared. But if you are a fan of progressive, thoughtful, briliantly executed and flawlessly produced music, you will do no better than PT.

PORCUPINE TREE's eighth studio album, ""Deadwing"", was released in March 2005 by Lava Records / Warner Music. Less rock-oriented than the previous album ""In Absentia"", ""Deadwing"" is partially based on a ""surreal ghost story"" screenplay written by Steven and sometime PORCUPINE TREE / NO-MAN art collaborator Mike Bennion. The 60-minute, nine-track album contains material varying from short airplay-friendly songs such as 'Shallow' to lengthier pieces like the 10-minute-plus 'Arriving Somewhere But Not Here'. Most of the music was written by Steven but the album features the largest amount of full-band compositions since ""Signify"" in 1997. The album also features guest appearances by Adrian Belew (KING CRIMSON) and Mikael �kerfeldt (OPETH).

In 2007 the band scored its biggest chart success to date with ""Fear Of A Blank Planet"". Featuring contributions from Alex Lifeson and Robert Fripp it made the album charts in both the UK and USA and saw them play to larger and larger crowds on the subsequent world tour. This uplift in fortunes was due in part to the band signing to Roadrunner Records who really got behind the band. In 2009 the band released ""The Incident"" their most ambitious work to date and also their most successful, charting highly in the UK, USA and across Europe.

Formed in New York City, USA in 1971 - Disbanded in 1976 - Reformed from 1984-1987

Led by the incomparable guitar of

John MCLAUGHLIN

, The MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA combined jazz, rock, and eastern influences into a fiery, dynamic tour de force. They recorded three intense albums during 1971-1973 and then the personnel changed completely for the second version of the group. A reformation of the group in 1974 brought

Jean-Luc PONTY

on board to play violin, along with a host of new supporting musicians.

Their first two albums are absolute masterpieces of the genre. A stunning achievement and surely one of the greatest albums ever made, ""The Inner Mounting Flame"" defies categorization as it juxtaposes rock, jazz, classical, Indian, and Celtic influences in a way that is at once aggressive and subtle just one short year after Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew"" milestone album. ""Birds of Fire"" was the culmination of a solid year opening gigs for the likes of EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER, and YES. The incredible ""Visions Of The Emerald Beyond"" is the essential album from the second formation. The focus is the interplay between guitar and violin and it is complex and interwined.

- Born February 12th 1950 (Pimlico, London, UK)

GUITAR BASED MUSIC WITH VARIOUS STYLES

(Blues, Classical, Folk, Jazz, New Age and Progressive Rock)

Steve HACKETT needs no introduction. He is definitely one of the major guitarists of this century. Ex-GENESIS, he is now a major force in the domain of music composed for guitar, rock as well as classical. Steve is a complex musician, drawing influence from a wide variety of styles and melding them into super compositions. His music has evolved over the years, and while some of it was not up to the standards that he set with other albums. They are still excellent.

HACKETT joined

GENESIS

as guitarist in early 1971 and featured across ten albums of their history. He replaced Anthony PHILLIPS, and stayed with the band during their successful mid-70s progressive rock period. I remember once reading that, if GENESIS lost their ""brains"" when Peter GABRIEL left, then they surely lost their ""heart"" when Steve left. In a way, it is easy to see how HACKETT was ""crowded out"" of Genesis in 1977. From ""Nursery Crime"" in 1971 to the double-live ""Seconds Out"" in 1977, he created in his solo albums his own style, dominated by his guitars, sometimes very classical or at times furious. His tracks go from a symphonic Progressive style to a more energetic rock.

From the first album ""Voyage Of The Acolyte"" while he was still with GENESIS to his most recent ones, all are MUSTS. For the most part, all of the compositions on HACKETT's first five solo albums are well-thought-out and impeccably well crafted. I would highly recommend ""Voyage of the Acolyte"" (missing GENESIS album), ""Please Don't Touch"" (powerful), his TRADEMARK ""Spectral Mornings"" (pure magic), ""Defector"" (another amazing album by Steve), and ""Cured"" (pop-oriented). This, along with ""Time Lapse"", ""The Unauthorised Biography"", ""Guitar Noir"", ""Darktown"" and ""To Watch The Storms"", are the best for people curious about the HACKETT ""feel"". However I believe these are his bests - it could rightly be called ""THE HISTORY OF MUSIC ACCORDING TO STEVE HACKETT."" Get them ALL...and HAPPY LISTENING!!!

8014,STEVEN WILSON,United Kingdom,Crossover Prog,,,artist8014.html?id=4135,,,,,,"Steven John Wilson

- Born 3 November 1967 (Kingston upon Thames, London, UK)

STEVEN WILSON, perhaps most widely known for his role as the frontman for the popular act

PORCUPINE TREE

, is an artist from the UK who, through his various side projects, has spanned a vast number of musical ideas and concepts. Some of the styles he has been known to utilize are heavy prog, psychedelic, electronica, post-rock, ambient music, drone, metal, and art rock. Furthermore, WILSON is intensely focused on production values, dynamic mixing and mastering, and all other sorts of building albums that sound best in high-quality systems. In short, WILSON has always been an artist that appeals to audiophiles and fans of meticulously produced music. This shows up strongly in each of his bands and projects, but it plays even more of a role in his solo efforts.

Photo by Lasse Hoile

Though some of his earliest musical recordings were demos that predated even Porcupine Tree, his solo releases did not truly start appearing until his ""Cover Version"" singles began in 2003. Essentially releasing one a year, each ""Cover Version"" contained a particularly unconventional song that WILSON chose to reproduce and one original song by WILSON. Also, in 2004, WILSON put out his experimental electronic album ""Unreleased Electronic Music Vol. 1."" Neither the ""Cover Version"" singles nor ""Unreleased Electronic Music"" feature any other performers, aside from some input from THEO TRAVIS on the latter.

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2013 ⭐

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2011 ⭐

That trend changed at the end of 2008, however, when WILSON released his first full-length, proper solo album, ""Insurgentes."" Featuring, among others, PORCUPINE TREE drummer Gavin Harrison, Prog bass legend TONY LEVIN, current DREAM THEATER keyboardist JORDAN RUDESS, and saxophonist/flautist THEO TRAVIS, ""Insurgentes"" proves rather quickly that it is not simply another ambient or electronic release. Toying with many of the styles that can be seen in PORCUPINE TREE, ""Insurgentes"" is a mature, laid-back album marked by less metal and more noise than PT's later albums. WILSON has stated that the album draws a lot of influence from shoe gazer, post-punk, and drone music.

Essentially, before ""Insurgentes,"" WILSON used his solo moniker for a final catch-all for some of his music, making it difficult to draw comparisons to other bands. Nevertheless, ""Insurgentes"" makes it possible to site some bands with similar sound. Of notable similarity or inspiration are RADIOHEAD, JOY DIVISION, GODSPEED YOU! BLACK EMPEROR, THE MARS VOLTA, and other WILSON projects such as BASS COMMUNION and PORCUPINE TREE.

Yes, some people would consider OPETH to be a pure (melodic) Death Metal band but you have to differentiate a lot. The four guys from Stockholm/Sweden feature a lot of different elements on their albums. We have the aggressive death metal with Mikael's growls (which are not generated with help of a computer, it's actually his voice) with lots of breaks, mostly acoustic including Mikael's clear voice. Mr. �kerfeldt himself always underestimates his clear voice and often points out that he is a novice regarding this kind of singing. But that's not true, false modesty is the term here. His clear voice is warm and simply beautiful. The whole music is guitar orientated, on the one hand we have great riffing for aggressive parts, awesome melodic solos and on the other hand acoustic breaks with admirable melodies with some Scandinavian folk influences here and there and of course Mikael's clear vocals. Sometimes you even get some PINK FLOYD or PORCUPINE TREE like parts or whole songs.

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2014 ⭐

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2008 ⭐

Sure, the band started out as a pure Death Metal combo regarding to their first release"" ""Orchid"" but from their second release on the prog elements got more and more. The second album ""Morningrise"" for example features a pure Prog song with PINK FLOYD like parts as well as epic song lengths. Mikael �kerfeldt who also is the indispensable head of the band, often mentions that he is a proghead and mostly likes bands like CAMEL and PORCUPINE TREE. No doubt, you can hear those influences on albums like ""Still Life"" and ""Blackwater Park"" but their highlight regarding to pure Prog for sure is their 2003 release ""Damnation"" which features an entire album in the style of PORCUPINE TREE. Not really astonishing regarding the fact that Steven Wilson of PORCUPINE TREE is a good friend of Mikael and Peter and even worked together with the band for their double release ""Damnation"" and ""Deliverance"". Steven Wilson also produced their album ""Blackwater Park"" which is regarded as their best work so far, not only by death metal fans but also by many others normally disliking death metal growls (like me). ""Damnation"" for sure is the album most of you would be interested in because it is a pure Prog album. But Mikael said that the band will not do something similar again, he even announced the next album to be their most heavy, we will see. Sure isn't that this release opened the door to new fans and certainly displeased some of their old fans coming from the death metal origin.

If you like Prog Metal and don't mind, some' death metal growls this is he band to check out. But you can check them out even if you don't like growls. I don't like Death Metal in general but love OPETH, even their death metal releases like their debut ""Orchid"". And that's what happens again and again, OPETH attracts people normally disliking death metal, people calling themselves, progheads because of their diversity. And that's the reason why you should try it as well.

78d7,BIG BIG TRAIN,United Kingdom,Crossover Prog,,,artist78d7.html?id=405,,,,,,"Formed in 1990 in Bournemouth, Dorset, England

BIG BIG TRAIN was formed by Andy POOLE and Greg SPAWTON. They were joined by Ian COOPER (keyboards),

Steve HUGHES

(drums) and Canadian vocalist Martin READ. Initial influences on the band's music included Steve HACKETT, Anthony PHILLIPS, IT BITES and PREFAB SPROUT.  A demo cassette tape of the band's first songs, recorded on 8-track, was released in October 1991 and was followed by live performances. The demo tape ""From the River to the Sea"" was re-recorded and released as a self-financed demo CD in May 1992, following which BBT played some higher profile gigs in England.

In January 1993, a second demo tape, ""The Infant Hercules"" was released and the band then spent the next six months writing the music for its first proper album, ""Goodbye to the Age of Steam"". This was recorded in a hectic two week period in July 1993. Soon afterwards, BBT signed to the progressive rock label GEP, where they found themselves as label mates of IQ.

""Goodbye to the Age of Steam"" was a big leap forward for the band, both in terms of songwriting and recording quality. The response to the album was very positive, culminating in a licensing deal in Japan where the CD was re-released in 1995, with a bonus track.

In the meantime, Ian COOPER had left the band (for family rather than musical reasons) and live performances were put on hold while a replacement was sought and a new album was written.

Recording of BBT's second album commenced in July of 1995 (with Greg filling in on keyboards) and continued, sporadically, until completion 18 months later. During the sessions, a new keyboard player, Tony M�LLER was recruited. Some of the songs from the new album were debuted at the band's only show from this period at the Astoria, London. ""English Boy Wonders"" was finally released in autumn 1997, although in an incomplete state as the band had run out of money to finish the album. ""English Boy Wonders"" combined progressive rock (GENESIS, VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR) with indie-pop influences (XTC, THE CURE.)

Steve HUGHES left BIG BIG TRAIN in September 1998 and went on to join THE ENID. He was replaced by Pete HIBBIT. They were subsequently dropped by their record label, GEP. After a few more live performances, the band's momentum seemed all but spent.

Greg and Andy began work on some new songs without the rest of the band, more out of habit than with any intention to continue recording as BIG BIG TRAIN. However, an album of material slowly began to take shape and BBT started to consider booking some recording sessions with long-time collaborator, Rob AUBREY.

Rather than book studio sessions, BBT decided to build their own studio and record the album themselves. This decision put the band on a more independent and sustainable footing.

In February 2002, the third BBT album, ""Bard"" was released on the band's own label (Treefrog - later to become English Electric Recordings.) At the same time, THE ENID went into hibernation and Steve HUGHES rejoined BBT.

A new vocalist,

Sean FILKINS

was recruited to replace original vocalist Martin READ and a fourth album, ""Gathering Speed"", was released in March 2004. ""Gathering Speed"" was a concept album which told the story of a fighter pilot in the summer of 1940. It marked a significant change in direction for BIG BIG TRAIN with the band exploring classic prog-rock territory with the addition of post-rock influences (SIGUR ROS, MOGWAI.)

""The Difference Machine"" album was released in September 2007 and went on to become the band's biggest selling CD. ""The Difference Machine"" features extensive performances from Pete TREWAVAS (MARILLION), Dave MEROS (SPOCK'S BEARD) and Nick D'VIRGILIO (SPOCK'S BEARD, GENESIS, TEARS FOR FEARS.)

In 2008, BIG BIG TRAIN re-released ""English Boy Wonders"" (an updated and completed version of the album which was partly re-recorded by BBT and fully re-mixed by Rob AUBREY).

In February 2009, songwriter Gregory SPAWTON announced that Sean FILKINS and Steve HUGHES were no longer members of BIG BIG TRAIN and had been replaced by

Nick D'VIRGILIO

and David LONGDON. Nick D'Virgilio, who plays drums for BIG BIG TRAIN on ""The Difference Machine"" and ""The Underfall Yard"" also played on GENESIS's ""Calling All Stations"".

LONGDON's first solo CD ""Wild River"" (2004) featured many musicians collectively known as THE MAGIC CLUB. In 2008 Martin ORFORD (IQ) invited LONGDON to sing on his swan-song album ""The Old Road"" which was also recorded by Rob AUBREY and once again featured Nick D'VIRGILIO. Shortly afterwards, LONGDON joined BIG BIG TRAIN in time to commence work on their forthcoming album, ""The Underfall Yard"", due for release on December 15th 2009. Guest appearances on The Underfall Yard include Dave GREGORY (XTC), Francis DUNNERY (IT BITES) and Jem GODFREY (FROST*)."

""I didn`t have to play it all the time, I just had to wave it around and look good"" -  Ian Anderson 2003.

Eccentric on stage yet rather thoughtful, reserved and even sombre at times when not in the limelight, the Jethro Tull image was the brainchild of flute wielding frontman

Ian ANDERSON

. Clad in scruffy vagabond apparel, and looking more like an anachronism out of a Charles Dickens tale, Anderson conveyed an old English aura during the band`s formative years in the late 60`s and early 70`s which would persist throughout the band's 40 year career both visually and musically.

Born on August 10, 1947 in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, Anderson was augmented by a revolving door of colourful musicians over the years which added to the flamboyance of the Jethro Tull phenomenon. Conceived as a psychedelic blues band in late 1967 the music of Jethro Tull has always been dauntingly intricate embracing many styles including blues, jazz, folk, medieval, classical, hard rock along with forays into electronic music, sometimes referred to as ""space age prog"". The lyrics were equally as sophisticated and sometimes reached new heights of grandiloquence commenting on depressing world events such as drug abuse, the oil crisis, modernisation, third world troubles and a deteriorating economy.. Other topics included fads, spy novels, environmental and social issues as well as metaphysical musings. With lyrics and music which ran deep Jethro Tull have often been over-analysed by both fans and critics alike and many of their albums have been erroneously interpreted as autobiographical due to the fact that many of their record covers featured artwork which seemed to depict Ian Anderson's likeness, something which he has vehemently denied in numerous interviews.

Jethro Tull can trace their origins back to 1963 when as a young art student in Blackpool, England Anderson formed a band called THE BLADES (after a club in a James Bond novel). By 1965 as a 7-piece they had changed their name to THE JOHN EVAN BAND and subsequently to THE JOHN EVAN SMASH (his mother supplied their tour van) Evan, whose real name was Evans, would eventually become the band's keyboard player for most of the seventies. The band relocated to London in`67, the centre of the British blues movement of the sixties in search of more lucrative gigs. However the band was gradually dissolved after which Anderson and bass player Glen Cornick joined up with guitarist Mick Abrahms and drummer Clive Bunker who had played together in a couple of Luton based bands, THE TOGGERY FIVE and McGREGOR`S ENGINE. The newly formed band toured the local club circuit and the only way they could get re-bookings was to pretend to be someone else, changing their name from gig to gig. Some of the more outlandish names they used during this period were IAN HENDERSON`S BAG OF BLUES (an error on part of an agent ), CANDY COLOURED RAIN, NAVY BLUE and finally JETHRO TULL.

History was made in February `68 when the band was invited back to play a second gig at the renowned Marquee Club at 90 Wardour Street in central London. Having been previously dubbed JETHRO TULL by an agent who was a history student, JETHRO TULL ( often mistaken for Anderson's name )  was actually an 18th century gentleman farmer who was best known for inventing a drilling machine that sowed seeds in a straight row. At the time the name meant little but would acquire more significance as the band's career progressed, incorporating more old English folk elements. Also in February `68 a single with their name mispelled as Jethro Toe ( an error at the pressing plant ), Sunshine Day, was released through agents Jerry Ellis and Chris Wright (founders of Chrysalis Records ) on MGM Records with an earlier cut from THE JOHN EVAN BAND entitled Aeroplane on the B side. Copies of this original 45 rpm disc are extremely rare. Although a number of counterfeits circulated, they are recognizable by their large centre holes as opposed to the smaller centre holes on UK singles. Although not as bluesy as other earlier JETHRO TULL work the music is clearly identifiable as that of JETHRO TULL and can be heard on the 1988 20 years of Jethro Tull Box Set as well as the shorter 20 Years Of Jethro Tull ( The Definite Collection ). By the summer of `68 after a residency at the Marquee Club the band had supported PINK FLOYD at the first free rock festival in London's Hyde Park on June 29 in addition to playing at the Sunbury Jazz Festival in August. The latter performance received accolades from the British music press and the band was offered a contract with Island Records.

Only months prior to the recording sessions for the first full length LP which was to be entitled ""This Was"" had Ian Anderson traded in his guitar for a flute. A natural musician, Anderson taught himself to play the instrument which would become synonymous with the JETHRO TULL sensation. Anderson would also assume a one legged stance while playing live particularly during solos. Later in the seventies he found himself in the hot seat during a press conference in India being accused of mocking one of their Hindu gods, Krishna. He apologized claiming that he hadn't a clue who Krishna was. Nevertheless, he continued the iconic pose which helped mould him into one of rock's true folk heroes. Although Chris Wright suggested that Anderson abandon the flute  Anderson refused and the first piece he recorded with the instrument was a cover version of jazzman Rashan Roland Kirk's ""Serenade To A Cuckoo"" and as it turned out  it was a jazz musician rather than a Hindu god that had more influence on Ian Anderson's stage presence and flute playing that shaped the future of JETHRO TULL. Anderson also had a flair for improvising and borrowed a humming technique employed by avant garde classical flute players by fluttering his tongue while blowing into his flute that would become an integral part of his execution. The album was a heavy psychedelic rhythm & blues rave up (the band was often compared to Cream) and both Anderson and Abrahams shared in the songwriting and vocals. Released in October `68 the album hit # 10th in UK and made the top 100 in the US.

In December 1968 Anderson and Abrahams clashed over the band's musical direction. While Abrahams wanted to continue on a more traditional blues path, Anderson had more adventurous designs and wanted the band to encompass other styles such as jazz, folk and harder edged rock. Abrahams departed almost immediately and would later form BLODWYN PIG. Anderson had no regrets and in a later interview would lament that  ""blues were my favourite colour until I looked `round and found another song I liked singing "". Meanwhile Abrahams was briefly replaced by Tony Iommi who was playing in the band EARTH (later to become BLACK SABBATH). He remained with the band for no longer than one week which was long enough to appear with the band for a mostly mimed performance on the unaired ""Rolling Stones Rock `n Roll Circus "". Davy O`List from the NICE was also later hired as an interim guitarist while auditions took place. Among the guitarists being considered were future YES guitarist Steve Howe (although he never auditioned) but after two auditions

Martin BARRE

who was playing with Noel Redding at the time was selected. The band made their US debut with Barre on guitar at New York City's Fillmore East on the same bill as BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS and the first recording to feature Barre was a single entitled Living In The Past released in May `69. Barre proved to be a more flexible player than Abrahams and fit in more with Anderson's musical objectives who was now firmly in control of the band. The two would constitute the core of JETHRO TULL for the next 39 years forming a unique acoustic / electric guitar alliance which endures to this day.

The first full length LP with Martin Barre, Stand Up, was released in the summer of `69 and explored other music possibilities in the form of folk, classical and Celtic stylings which found Anderson displaying his multi-instrumental talents on such instruments as the acoustic guitar, keyboards, mandolin, and a traditional Russian stringed instrument, the balalaika. It spawned two JETHRO TULL signature pieces, the folky Living In The Past in 5/4 time, unusual for a pop song in 1969 which foreshadowed complex structures which would make up the band's compositions, and another classic entitled Bour�e, the only track on the album not composed by Anderson, which was a modern take on the Bach`s 5th movement Suite For Lute in E minor which is still played by the band in concert to this day. The original 1969 vinyl gatefold cover of the album had cardboard figures which actually ""stood up"" when opened and won the New Musical Express award for best cover that year while the album soared to # 1 on the UK charts and # 20 in the US. Throughout 1969 the band toured extensively in both the UK and US, playing the Newport Jazz Festival as well as the Northridge Pop Festival in California. Preferring to release singles separately from their albums a number of singles were released during `69-`70 charting favourably in the UK. Most of these unreleased singles along with B sides were released on a 1972 retrospective double album entitled ""Living In The Past"" which also featured some album cuts as well as a live side recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City which demonstrated the band's improvisational prowess.

Perhaps one of the best loved JETHRO TULL albums was released in the spring of 1970. Benefit was a prelude for what was to come as the band edged closer towards progressive rock as Anderson continued to develop the image of a modern day troubadour on stage. The music focused more on sullen folk affections in addition to featuring harder rocking electric guitar. John Evan (formerly of THE JOHN EVAN BAND) appeared on keyboards and would become full blown member of the band on the subsequent Aqualung album. A phantom member, David Palmer also continued to provide orchestral arrangements would also eventually join the band in 1976. Palmer, who had been arranging for the band since 1968`s This Was, was formally trained in the British Army and also studied composition at The Royal Academy Of Music and his more serious approach to composition complemented Anderson's more unorthodox self-taught approach. Throughout 1970 the band headlined sold out shows both in Europe and the UK. In addition to playing the Atlanta Pop Festival they closed the Isle Of Wight Festival (hailed as the British Woodstock) with a searing performance on August 31, 1970.  This was arguably one of JETHRO TULL`S finest performances and is available on CD and DVD under the title Jethro Tull Nothing Is Easy: Live At The Isle Of Wight 1970.

If Benefit paved the way, then the band's follow up album, 1971`s Aqualung, consolidated them as bona fide prog-rock superstars alongside ELP and YES. Aqualung was JETHRO TULL`S  answer to Jesus Christ Superstar and dealt in part  with the glorification of denominational  Christianity and how it obstructed man's  individual relationship with the lord creator which led many to believe that Anderson was a staunch atheist. Musically it sounded nothing like the previous recordings completely abandoning the blues and broadening the acoustic/electric guitar marriage with plenty of opportunity for on stage prancing and flute hysterics. Anderson felt that audiences were coming out to see a show and that musical content wasn't enough and his aggressive stage antics were brought into the fore more than ever on the Aqualung tour. Consequently JETHRO TULL got away with shows which relied almost entirely on the charisma and energy of the individual band members rather than elaborate light shows or special effects. Aqualung was ( and still is ) considered by many to be a concept album while Anderson has consistently insisted that it was just a "" bunch of songs "" although a couple of tracks were dedicated to his ailing father. He even denies that the nightmarish cover art of a sneering vagrant was not in any way an autobiographical statement. Regardless, the album charted in the top 10 both in the UK and the US and several songs Hymn 43, Locomotive Breath and Cross eyed Mary received extensive FM radio play in the US. It was followed up by a massive 130 date 8 country sold out world tour. Drummer Clive Bunker, who departed for personal reasons, was replaced mid-tour by Barriemore Barlow and by now Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, an art college friend of Anderson's and the subject of several earlier JETHRO TULL songs, had replaced Glen Cornick on bass who had left to form the band WILD TURKEY.

The band was back in the studio recording their next album in Dec. `71, Thick as a Brick. This time there was no question about concept. Anderson had been threatening in the press after the misconceptions surrounding Aqualung that they would make a ""concept"" album and ""make it so bombastic and over the top"". And it was. An almost perfect textbook progressive rock album it was more of a tongue-in cheek crack at contemporary progressive rock bands more than anything else. It was nevertheless an audacious 44 minute social commentary on a young boy attaining adulthood prematurely. It featured insane time signatures and changes in tempo and included instruments not normally heard on rock records such as the xylophone, harpsichord, lute and a string section. The first progressive rock album to feature one continuous track from beginning to end critics referred to it as everything from a suite, ballad and even a symphony. The cover, as with most Jethro Tull covers, actually had something to do with the content of the album and original pressings of the album included a 12 page mock newspaper ( no doubt influenced by the Monty Python television series ) which poked fun at second-rate journalism which even included a review of the album itself ! It hit # 1 in the US almost instantly followed by an extensive world tour with various opening acts including Gentle Giant, Captain Beefheart and ex-bassist Glen Cornick`s band Wild Turkey. The afore mentioned Living In The Past was also released in the summer and fall of 1972 in the UK and US respectively capitalizing on the band's spectacular success particularily in the US where , like many British progressive rock bands of the early seventies, they had become more popular than in their native Britain.

Hoping to avoid UK taxes imposed on high income earners the band relocated to France in early `73 and attempted to record a double album in the "" seclusion ""  of  the Ch�teau d`H�roville recording studios but were dissatisfied with the overall results and dubbed it Ch�teau d`Isaster ( a portion of these sessions can be heard on the 1988 20 Years Of Jethro Tull box set and the complete sessions, with some flute overdubs, on the 1993 compilation Nightcap ). The band returned to England and reworked the material into a concept album which was similar to Thick As A Brick structurally, but it didn't contain repeating themes and was split up into four acts or 16 songs with unconventional lyrics and melodies all composed by Ian Anderson but ran as a continuous un-cueable track. It infuriated most critics but delighted fans who ate it up sending it straight to # 1 in the US. Passion Play was one of the more curious albums in the JETHRO TULL catalogue. It was much more esoteric than Thick As A Brick, musically reminicient of GENTLE GIANT at times, with dark lyrical interpretations of the possibilities that man might face in the netherworld. It clearly demonstrated Anderson's familiarity with the works of Dant� Alighieri, particularly the first part of The Divine Comedy, Inferno. What began as a collection of individual songs during the d`H�rouville sessions morphed into a full out serious concept album. Oddly, there were some anomalies which reveal the original intentions of the album, most notably a spoken word interlude which is inserted in the middle of the work written by  Anderson, John Evan and Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond entitled "" The Story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles "" narrated by Hammond-Hammond in the tradition of children's stories like Peter And The Wolf and Alice In Wonderland, suggesting that part of the initial draft had something to do with the parallels of human and animal lives. One could analyze, ponder, evaluate and re-evaluate the album until the cows came in. It wasn't one of Anderson's favourite JETHRO TULL albums but it is one of the more important albums in their discography in that it received such a bashing by the press (particularly in Melody Maker and The Los Angeles Times) that in September `73 towards the end of the Passion Play tour a disgruntled Ian Anderson decreed that JETHRO TULL would never play live again.

The band retreated to Switzerland for a rest and to write a screenplay along with a musical score for a movie proposed by Anderson and arranger David Palmer which never got off the ground because it was deemed to be too expensive. Some of the material became the framework for the next Jethro Tull album, Warchild which returned to more conventional song structures but retained a string quartet as well as Anderson's pensive lyrics. One track, Bungle In The Jungle, received considerable FM airplay and another, Ladies, revisited the folky stylings of the earlier Benefit album. The adage, never say never, held true when the band embarked on another successful tour of Australia, New Zealand, Japan the UK and Europe beginning in July  `74 in Adelaide, Australia and winding up in Copenhagen, Denmark in December.

Jethro Tull's 8th album in as many years, Minstrel In The Gallery combined modern rock with classical and folky aspirations with Anderson fashioning himself after the pre-Elizabethan poet-musician.  It was also to be Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond's last album with the band, departing to pursue a painting career; he was replaced by ex- Chicken Shack and Toe fat bassist John Glascock who also occasionally played guitar during live shows. Arranger David Palmer's contributions also became increasingly prominent particularly on the "" Elizabethan "" suite Baker Street Muse which combined a rock ensemble with a string section. Although largely a complex acoustic album it contained a couple of harder rocking songs which showcased the whole band, lyrically it was a dark and cynical album and reflected Anderson's contemporary personal hardships and gripes. It nevertheless became a fan favourite and on the subsequent tour the band reached its high theatrically, with the whole band dressing in suits with polka dots, stripes as well as rugby garb and tank tops and jumping around the stage like madmen. 1976's Too Old To Rock 'n Roll Too Young to Die! once again raised questions ""as to whether it was of an autobiographical nature"" as the title would suggest. Around this time Anderson had expressed concerns about the direction popular music was taking with the advent of punk and disco but insisted that the album, initially conceived as a play by himself and David Palmer, was about "" the cyclic nature of fashion "" focusing on a burnt out rock star who comes out of a coma as a result of injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident and becomes fashionable again. The album loosely followed a series of comic strips presented on the original vinyl gatefold cover. Dismissed as a ""colossal disaster"" by one critic it was not generally well received by the press but some of guitarist Martin Barre's heavier riffing could be heard here as well as some of David Palmer's more elaborate orchestrations in addition to the fatter bass sound of John Glascock. Despite the rise of punk rock and disco hoards of fans continued to flock to see JETHRO TULL in their prime element: the live stage.

Instead of succumbing to the commercial whims of record companies and the masses in the latter half of the seventies JETHRO TULL instead turned the clock back to Old England producing a trio of folky albums, the first of which featured David Palmer as a permanent member of the band playing an assortment of synthesizers as well as the pipe organ. Inspired by Anderson's switch to a rural lifestyle as well as his involvement with folk-rock band Steeleye Span, the largely acoustic Songs From The Wood sounded like Robin Hood and his merry men jamming in Sherwood Forest, full of whistles, mandolins, acoustic guitars as well as the ubiquitous flute. Tracks like Jack-In-The-Green, Hunting Girl and Fire At Midnight evoked the lore and legend of times gone by and the band finally began to receive positive reviews from the music press. Anderson himself likened it to ""a folky window dressing in a prog rock shop front "".

If Songs From The Wood smelled of the forest then 1978s Heavy Horses smelled of a ploughed field, concerned with more contemporary issues such as modernization and economic change, using the redundancy of the noble shire work horses which were once fixtures in the fields and pastures of the English countryside as an analogy. Coloured with mandolins, violins and acoustic guitars as on the previous Songs From The Wood, another Jethro Tull classic emerged in the form of the heavier No Lullaby which frequently led off set lists at Jethro Tull concerts throughout 1978 and 1979. Other tracks Acres Wild, One Brown Mouse and Weathercock added to the ""rustic"" aura the album evoked along with its predecessor. To Complete a perfect game, set and match trilogy was 1979's Stormwatch which was, thematically, a warning of sorts cautioning man to take heed to his environment rather than economic gains which is clearly stated on tracks like North Sea Oil and Dark Ages, still retaining folk elements with plenty of mandolins, acoustic guitars and plenty of trademark flute. Despite being cautioned by Anderson to refrain from a destructive lifestyle, John Glascock was dismissed from the band during the recording of Stormwatch in June '79 (Glascock's last live performance was on May 1, '79) playing on only three tracks after which Anderson took over the bass guitar for the remainder of the album, driving Barlow crazy behind his drumkit. Nonetheless Stormwatch was one of the most musically complex of all the Tull albums with shifting time signatures and multiple harmonics. Having briefly being replaced by Tony Williams on the last leg of the '78 Heavy Horses tour, he was permanently replaced by Dave Pegg in October '79. Shortly afterwards on November 17, 1979 he died at his home due to complications following heart surgery which coincided with the third to last gig of the Stormwatch tour. This was considered by many to be the quintessential period of the band and it also signalled the end of an era.

During the lull which followed  the Stormwatch tour Ian Anderson proposed a solo album to be entitled simply ""A"" ( after the initial of his last name ), inviting keyboardist / violinist Eddie Jobson as a collaborator who had previously played with Frank Zappa's band, Curved Air, Roxy Music and more recently supergroup UK. Martin Barre was also invited to contribute to a couple of tracks but ended up on the entire record as was JETHRO TULL bass player Dave Pegg. Drummer Mark Craney, who had played on Jean-Luc Ponty's excellent "" Imaginary Voyage "" album, was referred to Anderson by Jobson. The level of musicianship was no doubt retained but there were only scant reminders of the pastoral atmospheres and folky musings of earlier JETHRO TULL work. Gone also was the scruffy attire which defined JETHRO TULL on the live stage in favour of clinical white jumpsuits which made the band look more like DEVO than folk-rockers .Perhaps these changes came about amidst Anderson's desire to distance himself from the persona he had created for himself in JETHRO TULL His pensive lyrics continued to prevail but the harder rocking music he had composed for the album looked more to the future and exploited Jobson keyboard / violin talents which contrasted with the richness of David Palmer's earlier orchestrations giving Anderson's ""new "" band a slimmed down sound sans any acoustic guitar. After the record company execs heard the demo of the album they insisted that it be released under the name JETHRO TULL which placed Anderson in a rather awkward position. Before he could notify John Evan and David Palmer (devastated at Glascocks death Barlow had already resigned from the band) Chrysalis Records management had issued a press release announcing that they had been ""replaced "". Despite pleas from Anderson for them to rejoin the band they declined, having started a short lived neo-classical band TALLIS. The "" A "" line-up played 60 shows and also featured a high tech stage and, as always, earlier material ( fortunately ) was included in the sets and the band was disbanded after their last performance in Sept. `81,  although Jobson would rejoin the band for a one off concert in Berlin celebrating Bach`s 300th birthday in 1985.

A reconstituted band saw the additions of session-man Peter-John Vettese and ex-Cat Stevens drummer Gerry Conway replacing Jobson and Craney respectively. A return to magical and mystical themes resurfaced on 1982`s Broadsword And the Beast and the music fit in better with the solid renditions of earlier material that the band continued to play live without any reservation. The theatrics and outlandish garments were back as well including a pirate ship stage prop which sailed the band into Spinal Tap waters. The music was a hybrid of folk and electronic rock with Vettese`s sweeping synths creating alluring romantic effects. The acoustic guitar returned with traditional folk music also working its way back into the fold and JETHRO TULL fans were never happier after the mediocre ""A "", the "" Ian Anderson solo album that never was "".

Oddly,1984`s Under Wraps with cold war espionage themes veered back into electronic territory heavy on drum machines ( programmed by Anderson with no live drummer ), synths and Barre`s electric guitar pyrotechnics. Even though it was Barre`s favourite Tull album it wasn't a fan favourite and the American press ate it alive and it didn't make it past #76 on the North American charts. Doane Perry would join the band in August `84 for the Under Wraps world tour which would see the band perform on three continents with an orchestral album also being recorded with the London Symphony in the summer of that year before a throat infection sidelined Anderson and the band for most of 1985 and 1986. They came back stronger than ever in the first of another trilogy of more musically consistent  harder rocking albums starting with `87`s The Crest Of A Knave which surprisingly won the award for best hard rock / metal performance at the `88 Grammy`s beating out the likes of Metallica, Iggy Pop and AC/DC.  Even the presenters Alice Cooper  and Lita Ford had looks of bewilderment on their faces when accepting it on their behalf as the band were advised by their management not to attend as they considered it a long shot that they  would actually win ! Two further albums Rock Island (1989) and Catfish Rising (1991) stuck to a heavier formula the latter which echoed their debut, This Was, with somewhat more bluesy tracks.

Five years would elapse before JETHRO TULL would release another studio album with an unplugged world tour taking up most of 1992 which produced the excellent A Little Light Music live album with Fairport Convention's Dave Mattacks and Andrew Giddings on drums and keyboards respectively. Extensive touring during `93-`94 brought the band to such far reaches as Cape Town, South Africa, Santiago, Chile, Mumbai , India and Montr�al, Canada. Their globetrotting experiences had a profound musical and thematic impact on their next studio album Roots To Branches which took over a year to produce. Bringing world beat, folk-rock, and heavy rock elements together and leaning more on Anderson's flute playing with plenty of Barre/Anderson electric/acoustic guitar interplay, it nodded back to the band's 1970s material a la Thick As A Brick, Aqualung and A Passion Play managing some jazz influences here and there. Their last studio album to date ( with the exception of a 2003 Christmas album which contained traditional festive music as well as Tull originals, some of which had already appeared on earlier Tull albums ), J Tull.Com met with some controversy regarding the cover  which seemed to depict a phallic symbol on the Buddhist in the artwork. Consequently early versions had to have brown paper covering up the naughty part at the bottom portion of the CD. Not a concept work by any stretch, it was significant in the fact that it expressed the group's desire to keep up with the technology of the time and coincided with the launch of their official website on the eve of the new millennium. Interestingly a female vocalist, Njama Akhtar appeared on the title track, J-Tull.Com. The music continued to feature ethnic world beat ingredients particularily the ethnic sounds of the middle east and India; although taking a more simplified direction when compared to most of their previous work, it had a fresh and very up-to date feel to it.

Over a career spanning 40 years Jethro Tull has released over 20 studio albums (including an Orchestral work) 8 Live albums, 14 compilations with 26 members of varying periods of tenure in 20 line-ups in addition to countless illegal bootlegs which have surfaced over the years. Performing almost 2,900 concerts ( and counting ) in close to 40 countries makes Jethro Tull one of the one of the longest lived and defining musical acts of the progressive rock genre. Both core members, Martin Barre and Ian Anderson have released solo work with leader Ian Anderson receiving the MBE for music in 2006, among other prestigious awards in the arts. Current members who are all actively involved in outside projects are Mr. Anderson himself, on flute, guitar and other various instruments, Martin Barre on guitars, session man David Goodier on bass, music educator John O`Hara on keyboards and accordion (who is also the band`s orchestrator) and veteran drummer Doane Perry as well as occasional guests. When time and personal schedules permit former members, who Anderson has maintained cordial relationships with over the course of 40 years, also perform with the band.

As legendary as their olde English namesake, Jethro Tull are still touring with another studio album on the way. For one of the best loved rock bands ever there is no end in sight anytime soon.

"" When you want to hear where music is going in the future, you put on a King Crimson album.""

- Bill Bruford, 1995

For all its break-ups, periods of non-existence and fluctuating methodology, King Crimson remains one of the interminably compelling bands playing within the domain of rock music to this day. Widely acknowledged as being the harbingers of the art-rock genre with their monumental 1969 album ""In The Court Of The Crimson King"", they paved the way for innovative art-rock/progressive rock bands such as Yes, ELP etc etc. in the early '70s as well as providing a stimulus for more recent neo-progressive bands like Tool and The Mars Volta through their post-progressive work in the early '80s and '90s. More of a frame of mind than a style, the music of King Crimson has constantly sought out sustenance through amalgamations of existing forms of music, veering away from any contemporary mould, nullifying any notions that it is necessary to adhere to proven formulas in order to create commercially feasible music.

From its formative years in Bournemouth, England in the late '60s, King Crimson's unwavering guiding light has constantly emanated from the abstruse intellect of guitarist

Robert FRIPP

. Although he maintains that he is not the band's leader per se, he attributes the band's enduring viability to the collective brilliance of its individual members even though it seems to disband and reform at the wave of his magic wand. Fripp began playing guitar at the age of eleven with 'Trad. Jazz' perfomer Acker Bilk providing him with early inspiration. By the age of 18, he was playing with a hotel band in his hometown of Bournemouth performing at bar-mitzvahs and weddings while developing his distinctive guitar style which incorporated many classical techniques. While other early influences included such diverse sources as Bartok, Debussy and Django Reinhardt, he was particularly drawn to the 1967 Beatles song ""A Day In The Life"" which, he claimed, affected him in similar ways as classical composers and it was around this time his designs for King Crimson began to take form. In early '67, after playing with other local pop outfits, he joined two brothers,

Michael GILES

and Peter GILES on drums and bass/vocals respectively. By October 1967, having changed their name to GILES, GILES & FRIPP, they found themselves in London where they recorded demos for a quirky pop album entitled ""The Cheerful Insanity Of Giles Giles & Fripp"" along with a collection of guest musicians which was released on the enterprising UK record label Deram Records in September '68. Despite some humorous folky musings and jazzy guitar lines by Fripp, sales were dismal and no more than 600 copies were sold. Also, in June '68, they hooked up with multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald, who had received formal music instruction in the British Army, along with his girlfriend, vocalist Judy Dyble, who had previously been a member of Fairport Convention. Dyble stayed for only a matter of weeks before leaving for folk band Trader Horne when a former colleague of McDonald's,

Peter SINFIELD

, arrived as lyricist. Although Sinfield, McDonald and Dyble had no part in the ""Cheerful Insanity."" album, which has been re-released on both vinyl and CD several times, they can be heard on a 2001 CD of out-takes from this evolutionary period collectively known as ""The Brondesbury Tapes"", which was edited by Peter Giles.

A disenchanted Peter Giles left in October `68 to pursue a career in computers and was almost immediately replaced by

Greg LAKE

, a childhood friend of Fripp`s from Bournemouth, who had just quit a band called the Gods which also included Lee Kerslake and Ken Hensley who would go on to form Uriah Heep. The quartet (plus lyricist and later light show operator Sinfield) would soon change their name to King Crimson which was Sinfield`s idea because he wanted something which sounded more powerful than Giles, Giles & Fripp. In the accompanying booklet from the `91 box set ""Frame By Frame"", Fripp explains the meaning in some more depth : ""The name King Crimson is a synonym for Beelzebub, which is an anglicised form of the Arab phrase Bi`l Sabab. This means, literally, the man with an aim and is the recognisable quality of King Crimson"". Thus, King Crimson was conceived in November, 1968 (Fripp reckons the band were conceived on this date, and actually born on 13th January 1969). The band rehearsed for the first time in the basement of a London Caf� on January 13, 1969 by which time McDonald expanded his instrumental arsenal to include various woodwind instruments as well as a novel electronic keyboard instrument, the Mellotron, which pioneered the technique of audio sampling, while Greg Lake's astute tenor voice added an air of sophistication to the band's prodigal sound which would develop over the coming months.

Signed to EG management (a partnership between two entrepreneurs, David Enthoven and John Gaydon), an association which would last until the early `90s, King Crimson played their first gig at the Speakeasy Club in London in early April 1969 followed by a tenure at the Marquee Club which quickly earned them status in London's underground music circles. Their thoughtful avant-garde music audaciously shied away from conventional pop music traits, preferring the structure and form of classical music combined with the improvisational frenzy of jazz within a rock context. However, the acid test would come when they performed as a support act at a free Rolling Stones concert in Hyde Park in London in front of an audience of over half a million of London's hippest folk. Their impact was immeasurable, with Jimi Hendrix shaking Fripp's hand and heavy hitting record companies vying for contracts with Island Records in the UK and Atlantic Records in North America emerging as the victors.

Their debut LP,""In The Court Of The Crimson King (An Observation By King Crimson)"", which was released in the UK on October 10 1969, would become one of the most devastatingly original debuts in the history of rock music. Adorned with ominous neo-gothic gatefold artwork by Barry Godber, a friend of Pete Sinfield, it would also become one of the most recognisable rock covers along with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" and the Beatles` ""White Album"". Tragically Godber would die of a heart attack in February of 1970 at the age of 24. The music, with its portentous lyrics, spacious Mellotron passages and futuristic angular guitar lines had a very dark, orchestral sound to it. Tranquil ethereal atmospheres with baroque touches were interspersed with dramatic crescendos and decrescendos on most compositions while psychotic be-bop fuelled discharges featured prominently on the opening track, ""21st Century Schizoid Man"", which showcased the band's musical prowess. The piece would become the band's trademark over the next few years and conjured up enough doom, gloom and confusion to rival any prototypical metal band of the day.

In November 1969, ""In The Court Of The Crimson King"" hit number 5 in the UK and the band embarked on a tour of the United States to support its release on Atlantic Records. Despite the enthusiastic reception the band received, Fripp & Co returned to the UK just before Christmas whence drummer Michael Giles and keyboardist / reed-man Ian McDonald tendered their resignations citing the rigours of touring and musical direction as contributing factors. In an effort to keep the band together, Fripp himself offered to resign! But this was to no avail and Giles and MacDonald departed, releasing a mediocre album (the rock press quite liked it though, but it didn't sell) together in 1970. Later McDonald would become a founding member of Foreigner as well as making a brief appearance on King Crimson's 1974 album ""Red"".

This development left the future of King Crimson in doubt in early 1970 amidst rumours that Fripp was going to replace Peter Banks in Yes or join Aynsley Dunbar in Blue Whale. Greg Lake also had his reservations and had already discussed the possibility of forming a band with Keith Emerson as early as December '69 when the two met backstage at a gig at the Fillmore West in San Francisco. Nonetheless, dame fortune smiled and Lake and Giles agreed to stay on to record parts of a new album. Over the next couple of months other musicians were recruited as guests most notably jazz pianist Keith Tippett and session man Mel Collins on woodwinds with Peter Giles returning to lay down bass. Gordon Haskell, a childhood friend of Fripp's, was also featured on vocals on one track (only because Greg Lake left early). In March an offbeat single was released entitled ""Cat Food"" which used Tippett's jazz background to its advantage with Lake's vocals being very evocative of John Lennon's singing on Beatles songs such as ""Come Together"" and ""Helter Skelter"". A full length album, ""In The Wake Of Poseidon"" followed in May and sounded notoriously like its predecessor with neo-classical styling, sweeping Mellotrons (now formidably handled by Fripp) as well as a ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" doppelganger, ""Pictures Of A City"", which was previously composed by Fripp and Ian McDonald. Hardly a rag-tag collection of musicians but obviously lacking the chemistry of their debut, ""In The Wake Of Poseidon"" met with criticism with the music press, but was well produced and sold well peaking at no. 4 on the UK charts.

In August 1970 King Crimson once again became a bona-fide band with Mel Collins and Gordon Haskell (now on vocals & bass) becoming permanent members along with drummer Andy McCulloch who was recommended to Fripp by Keith Emerson, with some assistance from Greg Lake. The resulting album ""Lizard"" boasted a more Canterbury-like sound and also had heavier jazz colourings partially due to Keith Tippett's continued involvement. Fripp also brought in various session musicians who made the project more intricate. He also included a suite in four movements occupying a full side of the original vinyl LP which was introduced by eloquent vocals by Jon Anderson of Yes (because the vocals were outside Gordon Haskell's range). Fripp also toned down his guitar in favour of walls of Mellotrons and could be heard more often on acoustic guitars playing classically influenced passages while Sinfield's dark lyrics reached depths of profoundness making references to the work of Lewis Carroll as well as the Beatles. However, both the musical and lyrical complexities of the completed work did not satisfy Haskell and McCulloch's artistic aspirations and both packed it in October 1970 before King Crimson Mk. III had a chance to perform to a live audience (Haskell left because he couldn't get his way, McCulloch quit because the atmosphere was poisonous). Haskell went solo while McCulloch joined Dave Greenslade for three Greenslade albums between '72 and '75. ""Lizard"" was released in December 1970 and was certainly the band's most ""artsy"" recording and, while many regard it as the black sheep of the King Crimson catalogue, it still holds special appeal for connoisseurs of early '70s art-rock.

Fripp began almost immediately to fill the gaps left by Haskell and McCulloch. After rejecting a number of possibilities, including Brian Ferry (later vocalist of Roxy Music), he eventually settled for Raymond ""Boz"" Burrell as vocalist and Ian Wallace on drums. Wallace had backed a number of bands in continental Europe in the late '60s, returning to London in the early seventies where he worked with various artists on the live stage. Although Burrell had a blues/jazz background but only a rudimentary knowledge of guitar, Fripp decided to teach him bass with assistance from Wallace. Once again King Crimson was a touring unit and the new formation played their first gigs in Germany in April 1971, which included new material as well as selected pieces from the three previous albums. By December 1971, this line-up had released an album entitled ""Islands"" which was less focused and more ""American"" sounding than the previous three efforts, after which lyricist Pete Sinfield was fired from the band. He went on to work with ELP and produced Roxy Music's debut album. ""Islands"" did have its moments though, moving into jazz fusion territory with Fripp's incendiary guitar work on ""The Sailor's Tale"" while three other jazz-rock oriented songs made references to women with the track ""Ladies Of The Road"" making humorous gestures to groupies. The title track was probably the prettiest King Crimson vocal track ever recorded which conveys pastoral coastal images, which was centred around third-time guest musician Keith Tippett's delicate piano accompaniment. This configuration continued touring America in early '72 during which time Fripp almost had a mutiny on his hands when Burrell, Wallace and Collins became more drawn in to American blues, R&B and jazz stylings. This is quite evident on the poorly recorded 1972 live album ""Earthbound"" which documents some of the live performances during this period (although a number of 1971/72 recordings have been made available more recently through the King Crimson's Collectors Club). The band nevertheless held together until April 1972 when Burrell, Wallace and Collins departed to join British blues legend Alexis Korner in a band called Snape (Burrell would later become part of Bad Company and Collins would briefly become part of Camel before going on to become a prominent session man). King Crimson once again ground to a halt with Fripp's heart still set on creating more challenging and pensive music. He would comment to the press in his typical Bohemian way, ""Having discovered what everybody wanted to do, I found I didn't want to do it"".

Ironically, King Crimson seemed to avert the prevalent pomp & circumstance which was beginning to typify the very genre they helped shape. Their intense and serious music, as euphonious as it was, was rapidly being overshadowed by the flamboyance and animation displayed by bands like ELP, Uriah Heep and Genesis. All the instability and uncertainty didn't help the band either but Fripp was working on a remedy which would result in the next resurrection of King Crimson which, in the minds of both fans and critics alike, would be the most daunting King Crimson configuration of them all. By July `72 the band would consist of Fripp on guitar and Mellotron, Bill Bruford on drums (who had quit a secure job with Yes to become involved),

David CROSS

, a formally educated violinist and keyboard player who had played with various UK folk/rock bands,

John WETTON

on bass and vocals (another childhood friend of Fripp's who had previously played with Mogul Thrash and Family) as well as one of the most curious members of any King Crimson formation Jamie Muir, a Salvador Dali look-alike, who came from London's avant-garde circles, playing an assortment of percussion and other musical devices which ranged from finger cymbals, chimes, whistles and even a bowl of crushed pistachios, which would add piquancy to the intimidating sound the new line-up would create. Richard Palmer-James was also added as a ghost member to provide lyrics and inspiration.

The first performances the new band gave in Germany in October 1972 were mesmerising and even though they contained elements of previous Crimsons they traded in the orchestrations for the raw intensity each individual instrument could offer with frantic guitar runs, overdriven fuzzed-out bass lines, screaming violins, concise drumming with Jamie Muir prowling his array of musical devices like some sort of a half crazed primordial creature. Menacing improvisations which would also become a staple of the bands live sets would also come into the fore during these early shows. Although the music had more emphasis on instrumental performance, John Wetton's delivery of Richard-Palmer James' surreal lyrics equalled that of Greg Lake's and were much more powerful than either Haskell's or Burrell's vocals. In early 1973 the first of three albums, ""Larks' Tongues in Aspic"" (a throw-away line uttered by Muir), was released which would follow this framework over the next 18 months. Unceremoniously, Muir would quit the band in early '73 by sending Fripp a note explaining his intentions to live a life of spirituality in a monastery in Scotland writing that King Crimson was, ""an overall enlarging of possibilities and many aural delights"". It was accepted unconditionally with the band gleaning much from his brief but precious contributions.

Meanwhile the album itself charted almost immediately and King Crimson was finally being taken more seriously by the music press receiving encouraging reviews in major rock journals. Its unorthodox concepts and structure didn't sound like anything being produced by any other band at the time although inevitable comparisons were being made to the Mahavishnu Orchestra because of its similar instrumentation. Truth be told, the only thing the new King Crimson shared in common with McLaughlin's equally ambitious project, which contained more ""razzle dazzle"", was the improvisational potential of the music. Although its subdued avant-garde sound had explosive moments which featured wailing guitars and power chords, these sections were carefully thought out dynamically and were approached with cautionary discipline and restraint. This was true to form on the title track, ""Larks' Tongues In Aspic"", which cleverly opened and closed the album in two parts, with the vocal pieces being strategically located at the core of the work. They, themselves, contained intricate instrumental accompaniments with the Mellotron being featured prominently on the cynical ""Easy Money"" but more as an instrument in itself rather than a substitute for a string section, which was how many contemporary bands such as the Moody Blues were employing it.

Over the next year the group toured relentlessly in both Europe and the United States which was the way in which Fripp believed that the band should be experienced. On stage the band was a monstrosity of chaos, volume and unpredictable possibilities as they never played each composition in quite the same manner which resulted in dozens of illegal bootleg recordings being produced during this period. Many of their live improvisations also became prototypes for studio recordings or even became the recordings themselves! Consequently, the next album ""Starless & Bible Black"", released in March '74, contained only two tracks recorded entirely in the studio with the title track itself being taken straight from an improvisation recorded during a concert in Amsterdam along with the tricky instrumental ""Fracture"" with the audience being extremely quiet which seemed like edited out. Other tracks were treated in the studio and the vocal tracks, particularly the catchy ""The Great Deceiver"" and the sombre ""Lament"" continued to distance themselves from the pomp of their art-rock peers at the same time steering clear of any top forty notions. King Crimson stood alone, masters of their own creation.

Although King Crimson would play their last UK gig in October of '73, they continued to tour Europe and North America where they were worshipped by a fanatical following, who elevated them to mythical-like status. Towards June of that year the band had developed a louder and even heavier sound through their on-stage improvisations and often could not hear each other amidst the unmitigated cacophony. The player who was perhaps the most affected by this was violinist David Cross, who was finding it increasingly difficult to compete with Wetton's thundering bass and Fripp's ear-splitting guitar licks. Consequently he left the band after a concert in Central Park in NYC in July 1974. A new album was also in the works by mid-summer which Cross also participated on, along with other former Crimson members Mel Collins and Ian McDonald on soprano and tenor saxophones respectively. Although the album, ""Red"", featured two of the band's most intense and critically acclaimed compositions ever, the heavy instrumental title track, ""Red"" and ""Starless"" with its majestic Mellotron driven intro and resplendent saxophone conclusion, ""Red"" was to be the last King Crimson album for the better part of a decade.

Fripp, who was growing more and more disgruntled with the music business in both professional and personal ways also had mixed feelings regarding the direction of art/rock in particular. He referred to bands in this category as ""dinosaurs"" that had run their course and on October 18, 1974 he announced to the music press that King Crimson itself ""was over for ever and ever"". The ""Red"" line-up never toured although ""Starless"" had been performed live quite often in 1974, drawing enthusiastic audience response. Interestingly, the title track ""Red"" would be integrated into future Crimson live sets both in the '80s and '90s, where it sounded just as revolutionary as it did when first heard on record in 1974. A live album was posthumously released in early '75 entitled ""USA"", which featured material from the '74 tour as well as the compilation album, ""A Young Person's Guide To King Crimson,"" released in '76.

Dismayed somewhat, individual members went their separate ways with Bill Bruford making brief contributions to Gong and Pavlov's Dog as well as touring with Genesis. He also helped form the fusion band UK before forming his own successful solo group which included Alan Holdsworth and bassist Jeff Berlin. David Cross went solo and leads his own band to this day with John Wetton joining Uriah Heep as well as UK before participating in supergroup Asia in addition to success as a solo artist. Fripp, who had previous associations with Matching Mole and Van Der Graf Generator had also collaborated with the godfather of ambient music, Brian Eno, on the revolutionary and abstract 1973 No Pussyfooting album where he began to develop a guitar method he referred to as "" Frippertronics "". This involved the playing of sampled tapes over which he would lay down improvised minimulistic guitar lines to achieve esoteric sound sculptures which he would also incorporate into future King Crimson work. After taking an introspective sabbatical before returning to work as a "" small, mobile, intelligent, self sufficient unit "", he worked with such artists as David Bowie, Blondie, The Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel as well as forming another partnership with Brian Eno on the ambient 1975 Evening Star album, some of the music from which was used in early episodes of the Hitchicker`s Guide To The Galaxy radio series. In addition to two more solo albums in the late seventies, he also returned to live performing with a futuristic new wave band called The League Of Gentlemen in 1980.

In 1981 Fripp formed a band called Discipline which followed the art/rock framework in the sense that it drew ideas from foreign sources which included rhythmical elements of Javanese music combined with rock and pop stylings. In order to achieve a contrast with his own unique guitar technique he asked Adrian Belew who was touring with The Talking Heads at the time to join him and former King Crimson drummer Bill Bruford along with master bassist Tony Levin in his latest musical endeavour. Not only were fresh musical ideas sought out but innovations in technology were also exploited with the use of guitar synthesisers, electric drums and Levin's use of the Chapman Stick, a multi stringed instrument on which bass lines and chords could be played simultaneously by means of a tapping technique. The resulting sound was ""decidedly dangerous"" and occupied a grey area somewhere between the Talking Heads and the new metal derived grunge and industrial music which was also beginning to surface in the early '80s. It embodied many aspects of the previous 1974 King Crimson entity as well, including improvisation with heavy emphasis on intricate instrumental ability in addition to, perhaps most importantly, artistic freedom within the concept of a collective group effort. Prior to the release of the group's first album it was decided to change the name to King Crimson thus ushering in a new era of music that would continue to devastate.

The new album was appropriately entitled ""Discipline"" which accurately reflected the mindset which was required in order to execute the demanding nature of the various compositions. Their impossible time signatures, poly-rhythms and hypnotic guitar phrasings would also set the norm for the two succeeding works ""Beat"" and ""Three Of A Perfect Pair"" along with Belew's charismatic vocals and stage presence which would also recall Jamie Muir's antics from the early '70s. A more pop oriented attitude along with world beat ingredients was evident on the new album and at first they didn't sit too well with some older fans who were expecting a re-emergence of the darker more foreboding Crimson creature of '72-'74. But times had changed considerably and the Crims quickly found an audience both young and old. Some ghosts of the past did indeed linger within the new music as exemplified in the title track's evil twin, ""Indiscipline"". With its overdriven power guitar chords, it was by far the heaviest track recorded by the band to date (its meaning was deceptively simple being only about a sculpture Belew`s wife had created!) Their fiery live performances continued to outshine the studio albums with improvisations as well as updated interpretations of earlier material.

The album which followed in June 1982, Beat, which was largely influenced by the writings of Beatnik visionary Jack Kerouac, featured more technology and artistically went even further beyond musical comprehension. In March `84 ""Three Of A Perfect Pair"" was released with more ""accessible"" tracks being presented on one side of the original vinyl and the more ""excessive"" ones on the other. An alternative six minute dance mix was made out of one of the catchier ""tunes"" on the album , the bass driven ""Sleepless"" but it also offered a satisfying dose of murkiness in the form of two more experimental abstract pieces, ""Nuages"" and ""No Warning"" which no doubt contained more input from Fripp.

Fripp let it be known that King Crimson would, once again, be sent indefinitely into suspended animation by announcing, ""when the aim has been served or commitment discharged, any group worthy of the name disbands."" They played their last 2 concerts at the Spectrum in Montr�al, Canada on July 11, 1984, segments of which were finally released in 1998 as a live CD entitled ""Absent Lovers"". During these 3� years King Crimson toured Europe, Japan and North America and was the first identical line-up to survive more than one studio album. During the ten years of inactivity which would ensue before the next King Crimson resurrection, all of the band's members devoted time to individual solo projects and session work unrelated to King Crimson, while Fripp devoted time to musical education. He also set up an independent record company he called Digital Global Mobile to cater for King Crimson releases as well as other related projects. Many King Crimson live recordings from all eras of its existence have been made available through special free membership in The King Crimson Collector's Club via DGMs official website www.dgmlive.com.

In late 1994 Fripp woke King Crimson from the netherworld once more, this time with a new double trio concept for the band which would include the pairing of each instrument. The previous band would return along with

Trey Gunn

, a student of Fripp`s Guitar Craft seminars on the WARR guitar as well as Pat Mastellotto on drums who had previously worked as a session drummer as well as a playing in the pop band 'Mister Mister'. Both had also played with Fripp in a collaboration with avant-garde artist David Sylvain. A forerunner to an upcoming full length album was released in late `94 in the form of the mini - CD ""VROOOM"" which was dominated by Beatle-esque pop songs but also contained some heavy instrumentals which Bill Bruford compared to the music of Megadeth, Pantera and Metallica.

Fripp himself likened the new marque of heavy instrumental music which displayed more musical maturity and finer execution over mainstream heavy metal to ""117 guitars almost hitting the same chord simultaneously"". Expansive arrhythmic soundscapes which drew from Fripp's ""Frippertronics"" concepts gave the full album, ""THRAK"", released in March '96 imposing auras which were generated by the Mellotron in the Crimsons of the early '70s. As in the past, the live stage presented the Crims with a bottomless pit of opportunities which resulted in mind-blowing chaotic improvisations that one critic referred to as ""controlled anarchy"". In addition, players would detach themselves from the double trio to perform and record in smaller groups or ""fractals"" collectively known as ""projekcts"" that would serve as research and development vehicles nourishing the King Crimson creature as a whole with a constant flow of fresh ideas. This became the standard operating procedure up until `99 when Bill Bruford decided to leave in order to concentrate on his neo-jazz project Earthworks. Tony Levin also departed to focus on his own solo band in addition to session work once again reducing King Crimson to a quartet to face the challenges of the new millennium.

Many long-time Crimson aficionados considered the next album, 2000's ""The Construkction Of Light"", to be the band's weakest work since the '72 album ""Islands"". Nonetheless, it contained some of Adrian Belew's most imaginative vocal work since the 'Discipline' album. Other instrumental tracks most notably the guitar driven ""Frakctured"", a distant cousin of the earlier ""Fracture"" from '73's 'Starless and Bible Black', continued to propel the band on a more or less even keel until 2003's ""Power To Believe"" arrived with a vengeance. As the title suggested, a more powerful sound was sought out which leaned more towards the more sinister double trio sound on ""THRAK"" with all the guitars brought up to code for maximum output! Belew's vocals got cynical and outright strange at times reflecting some of the band's contemporary philosophies through their forward-looking music. Shortly after the release of The Power To Believe, Trey Gunn stepped down to pursue solo endeavours with Tony Levin reportedly to return to the King Crimson fold on bass and Stick along with Porcupine Tree Drummer Gavin Harrison fulfilling a percussion role.

As Robert Fripp stated in 1994 upon its reconstitution as a double trio, ""King Crimson lives in different bodies at different times and the particular form which the group takes changes. When music appears which only King Crimson can play, King Crimson appears to play the music."" It seemed that as this brief chronicle of King Crimson's mercurial career was being written in the autumn of 2007 some music has indeed ""appeared"" and and in 2008 yet another chapter was written in the chronicles of King Crimson when several concerts were performed with the reconstituted Belew/Fripp/Harrison/Levin/Mastellotto lineup. Much to the chagrin of Crimson disciples who attended these auspicious events no new material was forthcoming ( save for the compulsory improvs ), but the concerts were nonetheless met with rave reviews.

Once again, the future becomes a most devious proposition as the Crimson beast goes into hibernation  awaiting the divine intervention of ...........The Crimson King.

0f25,AL DI MEOLA,United States,Jazz Rock/Fusion,,,artist0f25.html?id=2075,,,,,,"Al Laurence Di Meola

- Born July 22, 1954 (Jersey City, USA)

Intense, that's the best word to describe the character of the music that took hold at the outset of the 70's. Powered by stacks of amplifiers, propelled by rock backbeats, fueled with unbridled passion, and full of the spirit of jazz improvisation, this so-called fusion music coalesced into a full blown movement with the arrival of John McLAUCHLIN's MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA, Larry CORYELL's ELEVENTH  HOUSE, and Chick COREA's

RETURN TO FOREVER

. We can feel the intensity in DI MEOLA's playing in his debut with RETURN TO FOREVER, 1974's ""Where Have I Known You Before"", or their 1975 follow-up, the Grammy-winning ""No Mystery"". That power-house formula of dizzying speed, demanding unison lines, and rock intensity continues on the group's 1976 Columbia debut, ""Romantic Warrior"" and carries over to Di Meola's debut as a leader, ""Land Of The Midnight Sun"", released the same year on Columbia. His signature sound, the ringing sustain of a Les Paul played through a Marshall stack is an integral part of al those projects. Guitar Player magazine named Di Meola ""best new talent"" for 1975 on the strength of his playing on ""No Mystery"". It awarded him ""Best Jazz guitarist"" for 1977 and also named his ""Elegant Gypsy"" ""Best Guitar LP"" for that year. Al went on to dominate the Best Jazz Guitarist category, winning five consecutive years through 1981, while also earning ""Best Guitar LP"" awards in 1978 for ""Casino"" and in 1980 for ""Splendido Hotel"". With those impressive credits, Al was instantly inducted into Guitar Player's Gallery of the Greats, becoming the youngest player in the magazine's history ever accorded that honor.

At the outset of the 80's, DI MEOLA put his Les Paul on the shelf and turned to the acoustic guitar, touring and recorded with a

superstar trio

including McLaughlin and Spain's flamenco master, Paco DE LUCIA. He returned to his old electrified ways briefly with 1982's ""Electric Rendez-vous"" and its follow-up, ""Tour De Force Live"". In 1983, the same year he recorded the bravado studio album ""Passion, Grace & Fire"" with the acoustic trio, De Meola had a brief reunion tour with his old RTF mates, COREA, drummer Lenny WHITE, and bassist Stanley CLARKE. Though the tour proved that the intensity was still very much alive, no record was released of this powerhouse fusion unit, together again for the first time since the 1976 breakup."

YES formed in London (UK) in 1968 with

Jon ANDERSON

(vocals),

Chris SQUIRE

(bass, vocals),

Peter BANKS

(guitar, vocals), Tony KAYE (keyboards), and

Bill BRUFORD

(drums). Well-known and influential mainstream progressive from the 1970's, and still around in some form ever since, they were highly influential in their heyday, especially notable for the really creative ""Relayer"", which included at the time Swiss keyboardist

Patrick MORAZ

who replaced

Rick WAKEMAN

During the 1970s, YES pioneered the use of synthesizers and sound effects in modern music. Driven by Jon's artistic vision, they produced such timeless, symphonic-rock masterworks as ""Roundabout,"" ""Close To the Edge,"" and ""Awaken"". In the 1980s, YES pushed new digital sampling technologies to their limits, selling millions of records and influencing a generation of digital musicians with classics like ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart"" and ""Rhythm Of Love"". Moving through the 1990s and into the new millennium, the band keeps expanding its boundaries by using the latest hard-disk recording techniques and, most recently, working with a full orchestra to create their genre-defying music.

YES gained large popularity with their brand of mysticism and grand-scale compositions. ""Fragile"" and ""Close to the Edge"" are considered their best works as it's symphonic, complex, cerebral, spiritual and moving. These albums featured beautiful harmonies and strong, occasionally heavy playing. Also, ""Fragile"" contained the popular hit song ""Roundabout"". This was followed by the controversial ""Tales from Topographic Oceans"" LP, which was a double album consisting of only four 20-minute length suites centering on religious concepts. Also, ""Relayer"" was their most experimental, yet grandiose and symphonic. They broke up, until the new jewel ""Going For The One"" and its incredible ""Awaken"" was issued in 1977. In later years, YES would go through many transformations. There were other very good YES albums after ""Going For The One"" (""Drama"", ""Keys To Ascension"" and surprisingly ""The Ladder"") but this is the last great album.

These albums can be found under Various Artists - Concept albums and themed compilations :

Yes - Solo Family Album (1994)

Yes - Friends and Relatives (1998)

Yes - Friends and Relatives, Volume 2 (2001)

NOTE: Being that the Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman album uses the name YES, we have added their at the moment only release ""LIVE AT THE APOLLO"" to the Yes discography instead of creating a new page for them, all their subsequent records (If there are more) will also be added to this page, unless we receive an official notification from the band indicating ARW is not YES.

Original members

Kerry LIVGREN

(guitar) and Phil EHART (drums) combined their two separate bands into one large band. Kerry's band was called SARATOGA, and Phil's was called WHITE CLOVER. The band changed its name to KANSAS. They were from the beginning just an ordinary rock band, but were quickly compared to other progressive bands in the 70's like GENESIS, YES and KING CRIMSON. Combining the musical complexities of British prog-rock with the soul and instrumentation of the American heartland, KANSAS became one of the biggest selling and most successful touring acts of the 1970s. With huge hits like ""Carry On Wayward Son"" and ""Dust In The Wind"", they helped define the sound of ""classic rock"". They are loved all over the world.

I- THE 1970s

The Early Days: Their self-titled debut album was released in 1974, but nationwide response was slow. Their second album, ""Song For America"", saw a softening of KANSAS' sound, with more classical influences evident. The third album, ""Masque"", featured more pop songs and lyrically quite dark. They suffered ridicule from people around the world, because they wore overalls and had a violonist, which made people think that they were a country music group.

The Best of Times: ""Leftoverture"", with the popular single ""Carry On Wayward Son"", became a signature piece and pushed the album to platinum success. The followup, ""Point Of Know Return"" (1977) contained the ever-popular acoustic ""Dust In The Wind"". During their tour, they recorded their first live album, ""Two For The Show"" (1978) and the next studio album ""Monolith"" (1979).

II- THE 1980s

Seeds Of Change: A year later, the band followed up with ""Audio Visions"", the last production of the original band lineup. WALSH left the band due to creative differences. ""Vinyl Confessions"" had Christian lyrical content. The next album, ""Drastic Measures"" (1983), had some hard rock material on it, including the song ""Mainstream"". In 1984, the band released a greatest hits compilation, ""The Best Of Kansas"", which featured one new song, ""Perfect Lover"".

The Second Generation: The group split in 1983, only to reform in 1986 with the albums ""Power"" and with ""The Spirit Of Things"" (1988). Sales of these two albums were not very strong. Thus, the second generation of KANSAS had come to an abrupt end.

III- THE 1990s: The Third Generation

The new lineup released their second live album, ""Live At The Whiskey"", and featured live renditions of their classics. In 1995, the ""Freak Of Nature"" album featured some powerful new studio tracks. ""Always Never The Same"" featured old classics and new material, done with the London Symphony Orchestra.

IV- The 2000s

Seeing the return of founder singer/songwriter Kerry LIVGREN, ""Somewhere To Elsewhere"" was released in the summer of 2000. ""Early Recordings From Kansas 1971-1973"" is a true gem. Another live album, titled ""Device Voice Drum"", is different from their earlier live albums.

Sally Patricia Oldfield

- Born 10th March 1947  (Dublin, Ireland)

Sally Oldfield  has been active since 1968, first forming the folk duo The Sallyangie with famous brother Mike Oldfield and releasing just one album.

In 1978 Sally Oldfield released her first debut album  Water Bearer and became a cult favourite combining lots of vocal harmonies, classical and poetic influences, not to mention some pop charcteristics too. Most notably the single  Mirrors was released off this album. She has released 15 albums since 1978 including live releases her last being  Cantadora in 2009. Oldfield has always been devoted to the mythical and spiritual side hence this influences a vast majority of her works. In 1984 she relocated to Germany as she had a large following in Europe and also subsequent to the demise of her current label at the time, Bronze Records.

She has collaborated with numerous other musicians, most notably Steve Hackett on ' Voyage of The Acolyte and Mike Oldfield's various albums as well as Terry Oldfield.

Her music has all the ingredients of Crossover and is further enhanced by her many conceptual works released since 1978.You will find elements of complexity of folk, pop and just plain progressive soundscapes."
f26b,SKY,United Kingdom,Eclectic Prog,,,artistf26b.html?id=1134,,,,,,"Sky biography

SKY is a British-Australian classic rock band formed in London in 1978 by classic guitarist John Williams (not to be confused with the American movie score composer of the same name), keyboarder Francis Monkman (of Curved Air fame), guitarist Kevin Peek, bassist Herbie Flowers and drummer Tristan Fry. Their unique style combined with the virtuosity of the individual members and easy accessibility of the compositions quickly gained them a huge and steady fan base. The absolute highlight of this era was a concert in Westminster Abbey in February 1981 (in fact the first ever rock concert there) which was video taped by BBC.

Unfortunately after only two albums Monkman decided to leave the outfit and he was replaced by Steve Gray. Grey's influence made the band sound more jazz oriented. After the third album audience interest gradually declined. After two more studio albums and a (excellent) live double album the band fell into oblivion.

The highlights in their discography ar certainly ""Sky2"", a double album with a broad variety of songs from very funny to virtually symphonic compositions. The other one is the above mentioned live album ""Sky Five Live"" on which every member of the band is able to show his prowess.

Highly recommended to everyone who likes easy listening and doesn't mind classical influences."
62d8,MIKE OLDFIELD,United Kingdom,Crossover Prog,,,artist62d8.html?id=839,,,,,,"Michael Gordon Oldfield

- Born 15 May 1953 (Reading, Berkshire, England)

Mike OLDFIELD took up the guitar at seven and was composing instrumental pieces by age 10. With his sister Sally, he secured a record deal under the name SALLYANGIE and released the folkish album ""Children of the Sun"" in 1968. He then landed a position playing first bass and later guitar with WHOLE WORLD, led by ex-SOFT MACHINE co-founder Kevin Ayers. During the next few years he also served as a studio musician at Abbey Road, where he experimented with a wide range of instruments. He gradually built up a home studio and began working on a large-scale project, playing all of the parts himself. This was the prototype for ""Tubular Bells"", but OLDFIELD had no success generating label interest until he met with future Virgin Records founders Simon Draper and Richard Branson. They loved his ideas and gave him plenty of freedom to record in their state-of-the-art The Manor studio, and ended up releasing ""Tubular Bells"" on their brand new label when no other record company showed interest. The record shot to first place in the UK and elsewhere, attracting the attention of director William Friedkin, whose use of the intro segment in ""The Exorcist"" generated widespread recognition (OLDFIELD was not pleased by the association, however).

Retreating from his newfound celebrity, OLDFIELD recorded several more critically acclaimed albums, similar in scope and approach but constantly developing new instrumental and compositional skills. In 1979 his single ""Guilty"" showed that shorter vocal-based pieces and more recent music styles were beginning to creep into his work; he also returned to touring in 1979 after undergoing therapy to combat his reclusive, solitary tendencies. His work in the 80s included such far-ranging releases as ""Crises"" (including vocals by Jon ANDERSON), the soundtrack to the film ""The Killing Fields"", and a song called ""Family Man"" which became a hit for HALL & OATES. Known for consistently offering a visual spectacular in his live performances, he also developed an interest in video artistry, including a video album called ""Wind Chimes"". The 90s saw a return to longer symphonic-style works, including ""Amarok"" and ""Tubular Bells II"", for which he departed the increasingly commercial Virgin Records for the smaller WEA label. His ""Songs of Distant Earth"" album was the first CD ever to include CD-ROM content, as well as album notes by legendary sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. ""Voyager"" showed his appreciation for Celtic folk influences, and he plays tribute to his first musical love on ""Guitars"". The huge surge of appreciation for electronic music from the 90s dance community led to renewed interest in OLDFIELD's work, and the third instalment of the ""Tubular Bells"" series shows a definite influence from the house music culture that surrounds his new home in Ibiza.

Multi- instrumentalist, visual performance pioneer, symphonic rock master - all of these apply to the prodigious career of Mike OLDFIELD.

COBHAM  moved to New York City when he was just three years old. Flirting with congas and steel drums at the early age of five, Billy started his musical career. He played his first gig with his dad when he was just eight, in New York, 5 years after moving from Panama in 1947.

Beyond already having a superb musical ear and dynamic technique, he refined his musical education in the New York's High School of Music and Art, in which he learnt more drumming techniques and music theory. He graduated in 1962 and began playing in the United States Army Band from 1965 to 1968.

In 1968 he played with various jazz artists, including jazz pianist HORACE SILVER, sax player STANLEY TURRENTINE, organist SHIRLEY SCOTT and guitarist GEORGE BENSON on the album ""Giblet Gravy"".

His career as a jazz rock artist started with no other than the most talked-about jazz musician of the time: MILES DAVIS. He recorded five albums with Miles, including ""Bitches Brew"" (in which he was uncredited). It was a giant leap for him, and through Miles Davis he met JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, who would later recruit Billy in the MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA in 1973, one of his most recalled works in the jazz-rock genre. Before the Mahavishnu period he also co-founded the fusion band DREAMS; which featured figures of the calibre of MICHAEL BRECKER and JOHN ABERCROMBIE; also in that band was RANDY BRECKER, DON GROLNICK, BARRY RODGERS and WILL LEE.

In 1973 he recorded his debut solo album, ""Spectrum"", which featured TOMMY BOLIN on guitar, JAN HAMMER on keyboards, JOE FARRELL on sax and flute, RON CARTER on acoustic bass, LEE SKLAR on electric bass, JIMMY OWENS on trumpet and RAY BARRETTO on congas. This time around he assembled a musical organization consisting of former DREAMS mates MICHAEL BRECKER on sax, RANDY BRECKER on trumpet and newcomers ALEX BLAKE (bass), MILCHO LIEVEV (keyboards), GLEN FERRIS (trombone) and LEE PASTORA (percussion); Cobham performed with the aforementioned band in the Montreax Jazz Festival; a performance which could be heard on the live album ""Shabazz"".

The trio Brecker, Brecker and Abercrombie remained with Cobham to record ""Crosswinds"" in 1974. Newcomers for the album were bassist JOHN WILLIAMS, trombonist GARNETT BROWN and renowned keyboardist GEORGE DUKE. The album had a similar style to ""Spectrum"", and not as funky as ""Total Eclipse"", which was released the same year with the same line-up as ""Crosswinds"". Billy by then had leaned more toward jazz-funk, in the same vein as HERBIE HANCOCK; a direction much criticized even more since ""A Funky Thide of Sings"".

In the same year he made another performance at the Montreaux Jazz Festival with the same band as in the ""Shabazz"" album. It was recorded and featured on the live album ""Life & Times"" and also featured performances at the Rainbow Theatre, in London. A year later ""A Funky Thide Of Sings"" and later on ""Inner Conflicts"" were recorded, but while in the former Billy used the same ""Shabazz"" and ""Life & Times"" line-up, in the latter only JOHN WILLIAMS from the ""Crosswinds"" sessions remained, being invited to the set ERNIE WATTS (sax),  JULIAN PRIESTER (trombone), JOHN SCOFIELD (guitar) and SHEILA ESCOVEDO (percussion).

In 1976 he made a concert tour with keyboardist GEORGE DUKE in the U.S.A and Europe. They also played and recorded in that year's edition of the Montreaux Jazz Festival, which would be released on the ""Cobham/Duke Live"" album.

In 1977 Cobham switched to CBS Records and made all the albums from 1977 through 1980 under that label: ""A Live Mother For Ya"" (with ALPHONSO THOMPSON, TOM SCOTT and STEVE KAHN), ""Magic"" (featuring PETE and SHEILA ESCOVEDO), ""Montreaux Summit""  (with DEXTER GORDON, BENNY GOLSON, STAN GETZ, ERIC GALE, MAYNARD FERGUSON, BOBBY HUMPHREYS, GEORGE DUKE and BOB JAMES).

By 1980 he resigned his contract with CBS and began playing for other artists such as THE GRATEFUL DEAD and JACK BRUCE, as well as the Saturday Night Live Band. In 1981 he recorded ""Flight Time"" under the INAKUSTIC label in Cologne, Germany; called to the session were guitarist BARRY FINNERTY, keyboardist DON GROLNICK and bassist TIM LANDERS. In the same year he participated in the International Percussion Festival in Seattle, along the likes of OKUTA PERCUSSION (Nigeria), ZAKIR HUSSAIN, ALA RAKKA KAHN (India) and the one and only, timbales master TITO PUENTE.

Later on in the early 80's he formed his new quartet ""The Glass Menagerie"" with DEAN BROWN on guitar, MICHAL URBANIAK on violin and sax, TIM LANDERS on bass and GIL GOLDSTEIN on piano. With the quartet he recorded two albums in 1982 under the Elektra label: ""Observations & Reflections"" on January and ""Smokin'"" on July.

In the mid-80's he made more commercially-oriented albums for GRP: ""Warning"" (1985), ""Power Play"" (1986) and ""Picture This"" (1987).  He then took a break from the studio to focus on international tours and to get acquainted with World Music. In the process he participated in PETER GABRIEL's project called ""Passion"" (Soundtrack for ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", a film by Martin Scorsese) in 1988. He would again work with Peter for the WOMAD festival in 1992.

In the 90's he formed two bands: one acoustic band called NORDIC in 1996 with Norwegian musicians and one German fusion band called PARADOX in 1997. He also performed with a band called JAZZ IS DEAD, which was more of a jazz tribute to THE GRATEFUL DEAD and released with them an album called ""Blue Light Rain"".

In 2002 he reunited with RANDY and MICHAEL BRECKER to release ""Drum N Voice"". Its sequel (""Drum N Voice 2"") featured other well-known figures such as FRANK GAMBALE, JOHN PATITUCCI, AIRTO MOREIRA and JEFF BERLIN. In this album Cobham returned to the jazz-funk sound that characterized his mid-70's material.

Throughout his musical career he has released about 30 albums (counting only his own work) and played with countless number of artists, such as MCCOY TYNER, LARRY CORYELL, HORACE SILVER, GIL EVANS, FREDDIE HUBBARD, STANLEY CLARKE, GEORGE DUKE and RON CARTER, among others pop and jazz artists. He also made projects with educational tools, produced through his company Creative Multi-Media Concepts.

93ee,MILES DAVIS,United States,Jazz Rock/Fusion,,,artist93ee.html?id=3906,,,,,,"Miles Dewey Davis III - May 26, 1926 (Alton, Illinois, US) - September 28, 1991

Miles Davis was not only a gifted musician (trumpet and composition) but also a major artist of the twentieth century. He was in a constant search for new forms of expression. Having been a painter himself, and not unlike Pablo Picasso he tried to renew himself in all periods of his life. He played on various early bebop records, recorded one of the first cool jazz records, developped  modal jazz, and was a pioneer in jazz rock . Only a few musicians have mastered like him to shape new forms and set aesthetic milestones.

The ""electric"" period of Miles Davis started in 1969 and ended in1975 when Miles retired due to health problems until the end of the seventies. In these years Miles distributed an important part to jazz rock. Columbia released  four studio records 'In a silent way'(1969), 'Bitches Brew' (1970), 'A tribute to Jack Johnson' (1970), 'On the Corner' (1972) and an important  number of live records (some released on vinyl only in Japan) :  'Black Beauty'/Live at the Fillmore West (1970), 'Live-Evil' (1970), 'Dark Magus' (1974) 'Agharta' (1975), 'Pangaea' (1975). A great part of the studio tracks recorded during these years were only released in the second half of the 70's and first half of the 80's on various compilations.

Beginning with 'In a silent way' Miles used mainly riffs or short segments and more often just simple rhythmic figures that would serve as a base for collective improvisation. At the same time the rhythmic changed from tertiary jazz rhythm to binary rock rhythm. Guitarist John Mc Laughlin became one of the key elements of the electric Miles sound. Influenced by Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles, Miles Davis used during this period for the first time new studio techniques, new electronic instruments (among them the Fender Rhodes electric piano) and new sound devices, (Miles would use heavily the Wah-Wah pedal, popularized by Hendrix) to enlarge the sound spectrum of his music. Miles was among the first musicians to realize the full potential of modern recording studios. He and his longtime producer Teo Macero recorded non-stop whole sessions, with the intention to choose and assemble the material afterwards. They would use this technique in an extensive way, especially on 'Bitches Brew', creating musical ""puzzles"" through multiple edits, up to a point where the original tracks are barely recognizable. ('Pharaoh's Dance'on Bitches Brew contained nineteen edits, including the use of tape loops, reverb & echo chambers).

In 1975 Miles took a five year break due to health problems. When he returned in the beginning of the eighties on the musical scene he oriented his music towards funk fusion:  'Decoy' (1983/1984),'You're Under Arrest' (1984/1985). In 1985 Miles changed after  thirty years  from CBS to Warner and started a collaboration with bassist Marcus Miller resulting in  the 1986 record 'Tutu'. Miles continued to record and tour until his death in September 1991.

7513,PREMIATA FORNERIA MARCONI (PFM),Italy,Rock Progressivo Italiano,,,artist7513.html?id=289,,,,,,"Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM) biography

Formed in Milan, Italy, in 1970 - Still active (after many changes and a hiatus between 1987 and 1997) as of 2017

The pioneer of Italian Progressive groups, PREMIATA FORNERIA MARCONI (PFM for short) is one of the leaders of the 70s prog movement. PFM developed a style which is uniquely Italian while maintaining links with the rest of the prog world. A lyrical, romantic and delicate music, full of fineness. A great melodic and instrumental richness, sumptuous compositions and arrangements. Sometimes compared with the early KING CRIMSON, the group had its own musical personality, with its elegant music.

""Per Un Amico"" (""Photos of Ghosts"") and ""L'Isola di Niente"" as well as their first, ""Storia di un Minuto"" are all virtual classics of progressive music, obviously influenced by early

KING CRIMSON

and

GENESIS

yet sounding nothing like them. The instrumentation is superb with fluid guitar, highly original synthesizer sounds, beautiful violin and flute, and ethereal vocals that are so important to the music, that replacing them with English vocals becomes a detriment. ""The World Became the World"" is another English-language album, but this time with the same music, so it's not as bad as ""Photos Of Ghosts"".

""Marconi Bakery"" is a compilation of music from the first three Italian albums. ""Jet Lag"", from 1977, had much of the original PFM spirit with a jazz inclination, akin to groups such as

ARTI E MESTIERI

, though somewhat more low-key.  ""Suonare Suonare"" came out in 1980, and saw PFM turning back toward their original sound, from the style of ""Passpartu"". On ""PFM - Live in Japan 2002 (Tokyo)"" the band plays classic tunes from the Seventies. A must for all prog fans...!"

RETURN TO FOREVER was jazz keyboard player

Chick COREA

's jazz-rock fusion band of the 1970s. Like WEATHER REPORT and the MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA, it was a group formed by an alumnus of Miles Davis' late-'60s bands with the intention of furthering the jazz-rock hybrid Davis had explored on albums like Bitches Brew. At the time, this was seen as a means of creativity, a new direction for jazz, and as a way of attracting the kinds of large audiences enjoyed by rock musicians. RETURN TO FOREVER started out as more of a Latin-tinged jazz ensemble, but COREA, influenced by the MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA of John McLaughlin and some of the progressive rock bands coming out of Great Britain, notably YES and EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER, moved the group more toward rock, achieving considerable commercial success. A later re-orientation of the band gave it more of a big band style before COREA folded the unit, retaining the RETURN TO FOREVER name for occasional other projects. COREA formed RETURN TO FOREVER in the fall of 1971 while he was working in STAN GETZ's band, and the two groups shared some members. In addition to COREA on keyboards, the initial lineup featured

Stanley CLARKE

on bass, Joe Farrell on reeds, and the Brazilian husband-and-wife team of percussionist Airto Moreira and singer Flora Purim. ""Return to Forever"" was the name of the first tune COREA wrote for the outfit, and he then adapted it as the group's name. The band made its debut at the Village Vanguard nightclub in New York City in November 1971.

In February 1972, they recorded their first self-titled album, though it was not released on ECM in Europe until the following year and did not appear in the U.S. until 1975. COREA, Clarke, and Moreira, all of whom had been playing with GETZ, left his band to concentrate on RETURN TO FOREVER.

The band toured Japan and recorded a second album, ""Light as a Feather"", in London, using some of the songs COREA had written and recorded with GETZ, such as ""500 Miles High"" and ""Spain."" It was released on Polydor Records. Up to this point, RETURN TO FOREVER was more notable for its Latin sound than for fusion, but when Farrell left in the spring of 1973, COREA replaced him with a rock guitarist,

Bill CONNORS

from SPIRAL STAIRCASE. Moreira and Purim also left to form their own group, and COREA brought in drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Mingo Lewis, unveiling the new lineup at the New York City nightclub the Bitter End in April. They then cut a new album, but when it became apparent that Gadd, a successful session musician, wasn't interested in touring, COREA replaced him with Lenny White of the rock band AZTECA, who changed the sound sufficiently that the band went back into the studio in August 1973 and rebut the album, which was released in October under the title ""Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy"". Here, RETURN TO FOREVER turned decisively towards progressive rock and fusion, with COREA employing an extensive set of synthesizers. The result was crossover commercial success; the album spent several months in the pop charts.

In 1974, Connors left the group and was replaced initially by Earl Klugh, though only for a tour. The permanent replacement was 19-year-old Al DiMeola, who left the Berklee School of Music to join the band. That summer, RETURN TO FOREVER recorded its fourth album, ""Where Have I Known You Before"", which was released in September. Backed by an extensive tour that ran through December and closed at Carnegie Hall, the album reached the pop Top 40 and remained in the charts more than five months. The band went back into the studio in January 1975 and quickly cut its fifth album, ""No Mystery"", which was released in February. It too made the Top 40, though it charted for only three months. It also won the 1975 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group. COREA signed RETURN TO FOREVER to Columbia Records, while remaining at Polydor as a solo artist. ""Romantic Warrior"", a concept album on medieval themes, was the first RETURN TO FOREVER album not to be co-billed to COREA on the original LP. Released in March 1976, it became the band's third consecutive Top 40 hit and went on to become its biggest seller, eventually earning a gold record. But with its completion, COREA again changed stylistic direction and disbanded the lineup.

Retaining Clarke as always, COREA immediately reformed RETURN TO FOREVER, adding his wife, Gayle Moran, formerly of the MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA, on vocals and keyboards returning member Joe Farrell, and drummer Gerry Brown, along with a horn section consisting of trumpeters John Thomas and James Tinsley, and trombonists Jim Pugh and Harold Garrett. With this personnel, RETURN TO FOREVER recorded its seventh album, ""Musicmagic"", which was released in March 1977. It became the band's fourth consecutive Top 40 album, spending more than four months in the charts. A third trombonist, Ron Moss, was added for the tour. On May 20-21, 1977, Return to Forever recorded a live album at the Palladium theater in New York City, but COREA disbanded the group permanently after the tour.

""Return to Forever Live"" was released in February 1979, when it spent a month in the charts. (This was the single LP version; the show was also released as a triple LP, Live: The Complete Concert, which was later reissued as a double CD, Live.) In 1983, COREA reassembled Clarke, DiMeola, and White for a tour.

COREA Clarke, DiMeola and White agreed to a reunion as RETURN TO FOREVER at the end of 2007, and then toured the world in 2008 mostly greeted by large audiences. A double live CD ""Return"" and two live DVDs were released in 2009. The latest news is that COREA, CLARKE and White are joining forces wth Bill Connors (and Chaka Khan), with at least one gig planned to be staged in Hollywood, September 2009 - apparently this line-up will use the RETURN TO FOREVER name.

RETURN TO FOREVER ultimately came to be viewed as a chapter in the career of Chick COREA who was sometimes given sole credit on CD reissues of its albums. In its time, it rose and fell according to the popular and critical response to jazz fusion in general, gaining accolades and healthy sales early on, but suffering from the backlash that all progressive jazz endured after the 1970s, when musical trends turned conservative and the remnants of jazz-rock mutated into smooth contemporary jazz. Also, it has fallen between stools in terms of music criticism, with hidebound jazz critics dismissing it as too much like rock music, while rock critics think of it as a jazz group. As such, there is a tendency to undervalue the band's real musical accomplishments, which however, remain available to be heard on the records.

f843,SUPERTRAMP,United Kingdom,Crossover Prog,,,artistf843.html?id=324,,,,,,"Supertramp biography

Formed in 1969 in London, England - Disbanded in 1988 - Reunited intermittently from 1996 to 2002 - Reformed in 2010/11 for European tour

A variant of progressive rock that some have called sophisto-rock. SUPERTRAMP is a sophisticated pop band that was able to continuously turn out very good songs. Their music has been described as whimsy, lighthearted, fluff and a million other variations on this theme. This music is the kind of thing that you will put on while you and your wife lounging around after dinner. Mellow and very good. One other thing is that they also have the ability to inject some humor into their music now and then. Althogh most of the songs on the album are rock radio staples. This is something that is hard to find.

For some of their best work you will have to look elsewhere. They had a remarkable change in fortune as ""Crime of the Century"" became one of the top-selling albums of 1974. The band had refined their keyboard-dominated sound and produced an album that was well-reviewed. The album ""Even In The Quietest Moments..."" is by far their best work. With over 18 million copies to date, ""Breakfast In America"" is one of the greatest melodic pop/rock albums of the seventies. After that album, SUPERTRAMP continued to develop a more R&B-flavored style; the change in direction was successful on 1982's ""Famous Last Words"", but they soon ran out of hits. SUPERTRAMP continued with occasional tours and infrequent albums. Their recent releases, however, have only found minor success.

af09,ART ZOYD,France,RIO/Avant-Prog,,,artistaf09.html?id=858,,,,,,"Founded in  Valenciennes, France in 1969

In 1968, French smalltown Maubeuge was giving birth to this fascinating avant-garde outfit that now boasts 13 albums, 17 videos, many soundtracks and music for shows, worldwide festival appearances plus numerous live and compilation disks. By the early 80's, ART ZOYD had already gone through over 30 musicians but the core always centered around composer and classically-trained violinist G�rard Hourbette and bassist Thierry Zaboitzeff. Constantly evolving over the years, their music is always highly adventurous, drawing on elements of the modern classics (Bartok, Stravinsky), the chamber rock of UNIVERS ZERO, a bit of jazz, a good dose of zeuhl and lately, a penchant for electronics. Despite their lack of a drummer, their material is intensely rhythmic and largely relies on strings, horns and piano. Considered more 'neo-classical chamber' than truly rock, their energy level has the intensity of bands such as MAGMA and 70's KING CRIMSON, with strong dynamics and atmospheric climaxes.

With each successive album, the rock aspect of their material slowly gave way to a blend of zeuhl and classical music, developing ever tenser and darker climates - surely not for the faint of heart. ""Phase IV"" (1982) is hailed as their all-time masterpiece and displays a remarkable ""ear"" for dense and dramatic textures. ""Les espaces inquiets"" (1983) is in the same vein but a bit more experimental, the music alternating between ominous, plodding parts with minimal instrumentation (usually a solo piano or organ) and faster, more frantic sections led by trumpet and strings. ""Le mariage du ciel et de l'enfer"" (1985) is perhaps the one that best displays the band's adventurous compositional sophistication while remaining reasonably digestible for new listeners. ""Nosferatu"" (1989) features nightmarish music that could wake the dead - albeit all too willing to oblige, no doubt. Finally, ""Haxan"" (1997) shows the band at their most 'electronic'. It features UNIVERS ZERO's drummer Daniel Denis who mostly plays around with sample triggers (sequencers). A good sampler for ART ZOYD neophytes is their 1987 album ""Les espaces inquiets / Phase IV / Archives II"", made up of 32 tracks covering the two cd's plus a few extras.

If you get off on UNIVERS ZERO, MAGMA or RIO in general, if you have a passion for the likes of Bartok, Stravinsky and Schoenberg, you definitely should check out the music of ART ZOYD : it is risky, unsafe, dark, stirring and immensely stimulating.

It's a simple bass note written on a Fender Rhodes piano that started everything. Thomas played a big role in the songwriting and the production and with his playing skills. The album ""A Drop of Light"" also received the help of 5 musicians playing sax, flute, and trumpet. The release of the album is the result of 5 years of work.

�nglag�rd were a short-lived band who nonetheless generated critical acclaim and a loyal following in the early nineties with their brooding Mellotron and synth heavy sound that also featured virtuoso percussionist Mattias Olsson and classically trained flautist Anna Holmgren.

The band was formed in the summer of 1991 by guitarist and lead vocalist Tord Lindman and bassist Johan H�gberg. The pair placed ads to form a band in the vein of the seventies progressive bands such as Yes and King Crimson, which were successfully answered by keyboardist Thomas Johnson and guitarist Jonas Engdeg�rd. Drummer Olsson and flautist Holmgren were soon added and by the following spring the band were touring and logging studio sessions that would yield the well-received album Hybris. The release was followed by an American tour which included an appearance at the 1993 Progfest in Los Angeles. By 1994 the band had released their second and final album Epilog, followed again by an appearance at Progfest. This would prove to be the band's final performance.   The Progfest recordings were engineered and released in 1996 as the live requiem Buried Alive.

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2012 ⭐

Founding member Lindman went on to a career in the film business after the demise of the band, while the remaining members reformed briefly to tour in 2003, but are currently on indefinite hiatus. Olsson has since had a hand in the formation of Nanook of the North and has played in Pineforest Crunch and the Par Lindh Project, among others. Johnson has also appeared on studio released for the post-rock project Reminder.

�nglag�rd's sound is rich in mellotron, Hammond and piano, and a brooding wash of guitars and bass/bass pedal accented by Holmgren's moody and precise flute. The band's compositions are characterized by long, often instrumental tracks with significant tempo shifts and sometimes intense guitar flourishes. The Epilog album is instrumental in its entirety, and many of the tracks are distinguished by striking passages from Johnson's grand piano. Early Porcupine Tree also comes to mind, particularly when listening to Epilog.

�nglag�rd deserves a place in the Archives for their admirable effort in carrying the banner of large, expansive symphonic music well into the nineties, with a sound that both pays homage to the great progressive giants of the seventies, and advances that sound with virtuoso accompaniment and expansive, layered compositions.

Founded in Paris, France in 1970 - Disbanded in 1985 - Reformed in 2011

Formed in 1970, the ESKATON KOMMANDKESTRA continued the Zeuhl tradition spearheaded by Christian Vander's MAGMA.  In an move towards accessibility they discard the Kobaian lyrics, opting instead for their native French.  In 1974 original members Xavier de Raymond (Fender piano), Gerard Konig (drums), Marc Rosenberg (bass guitar), and Alain Blesing (guitar) are joined by Paule Kleynnaert (vocals), Amara Tahir (vocals), Eris Guillaume (keyboards), and Andre Bernardi (guitar) becoming simply ESKATON.

1979 saw the release of their first single ""Musique Post Atomique"", and the recording of their first album ""4 Visions"" (which would remain unreleased until 1981).  Personnell changes (Alain Blessing, Eric Guillaume and Xavier de Raymond out, Gilles Rozenberg and MALICORNE's violinist Patrick Lemercier in) resulted in shorter songs, tighter arrangements and their next release, 1980's ""Ardeur"".  In 1983 after the addition of synthesizers into their arrangements, and a move away from their more traditional Zeuhl sound, ESKATON recorded their last release ""Fiction"".  In 1984 Gilles Rozenberg left the group, and the remaining members recorded their last album ""I Care"", which was never released.

Now 20 years later, ESKATON remains one of Zeuhl's brightest moments, and their album ""4 Visions"" (released on CD in 1995 through Sweeden's Ad Perpetuam Memoriam label) is a masterpiece of the entire genre.

In '73 they released ""Zarathustra"" (about Nietzsche's superman), this album is still considered as one of the masterpieces in the world of progrock. And it's one of the most sought after ""collector items"". In '92 the CD's ""Rare and Unreleased"" and ""Live"" '72 were released, both interesting but with inferior sound quality.  A new line-up with the drummer and the bass player who made the album ""Exit"" in 2000.

The album ""Zarathustra"" starts with the magnificent titletrack (five parts, almost 21 minutes). The foundation is a beautiful theme (like in ""Firth of Fifth"" from GENESIS) that returns in different climates (from dreamy to heavy and bombastic) and with different colouring of the instruments. The interplay between the electric guitar, keyboards (Hammond organ, synthesizer and piano), rhythm-section (propulsive and perfectly timed drumming) and strong and expressive Italian vocals is very captivating. It all creates a constant tension, topped by majestic eruptions of the Mellotron. The omni-presence of this instrument gives the titletrack the same thrilling impact as it does on the early albums from KING CRIMSON and GENESIS! The other three (shorter) tracks sound flowing and powerful with a lot of Hammond organ and guitarplay with echoes from Steve HACKETT. ESSENTIAL!

A long anticipated return called ""Barbarica"" arrives in April 2013.

⭐ Collaborators Top Prog Album of 2009 ⭐

MAGMA is a progressive group led by drummer/composer/vocalist

Christian VANDER

that has been active in the 'classic period' and in the 21st century. The music of MAGMA is often categorized as 'Zeuhl' (which means 'celestial' or 'heavenly' in Koba�an, MAGMA's own language). The band doesn't clearly fit in any other progressive subgenre, although avant-prog would qualify, and it has a significant vein of jazz-rock fusion running through the discography. Additionally, Magma has played the RIO (Rock in Opposition) fests which gives it certain RIO credentials.

Swirling riffs in odd time signatures, theatrical choir arrangements, heavy and distorted pulsing bass guitar, bombastic and minimalistic (sometimes both at the same time), dark and brooding, adventurous and angelic, jazzy or classical, but always with the highly innovative and original drums of founder and main composer Christian VANDER, those are just some of the ways to describe the music of Magma. While the music of MAGMA is adopted by the progressive rock movement, even for progressive standards it can be very hard to get into because of its 'other worldly sound' and its extended compositions of often more then thirty minutes. Reputedly the band had had almost no connection whatsoever with other bands of the Prog genre, although in France it would prove to be a big inspiration for other Fusion and Zeuhl bands. It is often thought that the modern classical music of Carl ORFF (for instance Carmina Burana) must have been a big influence on MAGMA. VANDER himself has claimed on several occasions that his main influence was the jazz saxophone player John COLTRANE, and listening to COLTRANE's version of 'My favorite things' we do find finds of what was to become the Zeuhl genre. Legend goes that MAGMA was formed after Christian VANDER experienced a dream involving the vision of a spiritual and ecological future for mankind. This vision would influence the three different multi-part saga's, namely the Koba�an saga (debut and 1001 Centigrates), the K�hntark�sz triology (Kohntarkosz Anteria or K.A., K�hntark�sz and �m�hnt�htt-R�) and the Theusz Hamtaahk triology (Theusz Hamtaahk, Mekan�k Destrukt�w Kommand�h or M.D.K and Wurdah �tah). The third studio-album of MAGMA, M.D.K., is often seen as the genre defining Zeuhl album, whereas the first two MAGMA albums have stronger jazzrock/fusion leanings and less Orffian choir arrangements.

Being heavily disturbed by his vision, classically trained drummer and composer Christian VANDER formed the first version of MAGMA in 1969 in Paris as a means to give musical expression to his fears for humanity. With a small list of fusion and rhythm and blues musicians, among them some wind-players and one of MAGMA's main vocalists; Klaus BLASQUIZ, the band created a double concept album heavenly drenched in fusion, avant-prog and modern classical music. In order to be fully capable of expressing the artistic vision of the band all lyrics were written in Koba�an. Vander would later state that ""when I wrote, the sounds [of Koba�an] came naturally with it - I didn't intellectualize the process by saying ""Ok, now I'm going to write some words in a particular language"", it was really sounds that were coming at the same time as the music."" The debut album would tell the story of a group of Earthlings that start a new civilization on the planet Kobaia in order to be able to live in harmony with nature whilst using advanced technology. The second half of the record tells of a rescue of an Earth space vessel. The saved Earthlings are amazed with the Koba�an society and ask for help in order to save planet Earth, which by that time is plagued by man-made disasters that threaten the survival of the planet. The Koba�ans decide, after some discussion, to send a small party to accompany the Earthlings back home.

The second MAGMA album, '1001� Centigrades', was released in 1971 and showed the band becoming more professional and tight. Meanwhile, the compositional skills of VANDER had grown, which resulted in the first lengthy MAGMA piece 'R�ah Sah�ltaahk ' - this can be seen as a step toward what would become the Zeuhl genre. On the second side the music has a strong jazz-rock/fusion feel, whilst keeping faithful to the avant-prog sound of the debut album. The album chronicles the arrival of the Koba�an delegation on planet Earth and their imprisonment. As a reaction to this the Koba�an civilization threatens to use their ultimate weapon, which is likely to be reason for the title of the album.

In 1973 the band would return to the studio to record 'Mekan�k Kommand�h'. The recording was refused by their record company, which resulted in the recording of 'M�kan�k D�strukt�ẁ K�mmand�h' (M.D.K.) in the same year. The discarded recording was later released by Seventh Records in 1989 and can be seen as a rawer version of M.D.K. with a bigger emphasis on drums and without the wind-section. 'M.D.K.' is often cited as a milestone for rock history because it is the first album to feature the signature sound of MAGMA and it can be seen as the foundation of the Zeuhl genre in general. Whereas the wind-section would be less jazzy, it would prove to be a very powerful tool in giving the music an imperial and dark feel, only to be further enriched with female choir arrangements over repetitive piano motives in daring time signatures. This made 'M.D.K.' one of the most bombastic and daring records of the seventies. On 'M.D.K.' Christian VANDER's wife, Stella VANDER, would make her entry and would from then on be an important member of the band. Former bass-player Francis MOZE was replaced by Jannick TOP, who would add the heavy distorted bass-guitar sound to the Zeuhl style. His influence on MAGMA would rise the coming years, which makes him a co-founder of the Zeuhl genre for many of its listeners. The story-line would continue with Nebehr Gudahtt, a prophet heavily influenced by Koba�an philosophy who prophesies 'Theusz Hamtaahk' (Time of Hatred), which would be the name of the trilogy of which 'M.D.K.' would prove to be the closing piece. As the crowds march in anger against Gudahtt, they start asking existential questions. This results in sympathy for the prophet's words and people start marching with him instead of against him, thereby averting doom.

In the 1974 Christian VANDER would work on a soundtrack album for the avant-garde film 'Tristan and Isolt', by Yvan LAGRANGE. The album features a stripped down version of MAGMA, consisting of piano, drums, bass and vocals. Whereas the album was released as a Christian VANDER solo-album, it is nowadays perceived as a full-blown MAGMA album under the name of 'Ẁurdah �tah' (Dead Earth), being the second movement of the 'Theusz Hamtaahk'-trilogy. The first movement of the trilogy, the title track, was never recorded in the studio and would make its first appearance on the 1981 live album 'Retrospektiw I'. Nowadays the 'Ẁurdah �tah'-album is an acclaimed MAGMA record in which VANDER shows the band can be equally impressive with a smaller group of musicians, making a very well composed Zeuhl album that has its distinct place within the discography of the band.

In the same year MAGMA would release a studio album under its own flag, the dark and brooding experience called 'K�hntark�sz'. VANDER would embark on a new chronicle, this time about a man called K�hntark�sz who enters the tomb of an ancient master called �m�hnt�htt-R�, who died whilst reaching for immortality. In the tomb K�hntark�sz receives a vision in which the master his secrets are revealed to him. In the next year the band would release the double live album 'Live' (otherwise known as Hha� or K�hntark) on which a reworked version of K�hntark�sz would be played in its entirety. This live album is often seen as one of the best live-albums of the progressive rock genre because it shows the unmatched precision and professionalism of the band on stage. Quite frankly, the level of musicianship and interplay is almost unbelievable. On this live-album bass-player Bernard PAGANOTTI would make his entry, though he and Jannick TOP would both make contributions to the upcoming record.

In 1976 the band's direction changed. With the progressive movement on its decline, MAGMA decided to make an album '�d� Ẁ�d�' with shorter songs on the first side and one dark avant-garde epic 'Du Futura' on the second side. From now on the band leaves very few clues for a story-line, although on the record's sleeve one can find a description of the story of 'Du Futura'. Other band-members would contribute on the song-writing, with pieces of PAGANOTTI & BLASQUIZ, VANDER and Jannick TOP (who would write both 'Ork's Sun' and 'Du Futura'). 'Du Futura' is seen as a classic MAGMA creation, with its dark pulsing bass-lines, grooming vocals, striking minimalism and unearthly style. The other tracks feature different styles and hints to them, such as spiritual music, ghost-house music, world music and even some disco-rhythms do appear. The synthesizer would make its entry into the sound-mix, though its minimalistic use is quite distinctive. After a VANDER & TOP tour bass-player TOP left the band, which led to the entry of Guy DELACROIX on the 1978 'Attahk' album. The album has seven pieces and is perhaps the most diverse MAGMA album, whilst fans might point out that MAGMA's former balance and vision is strongly on the decline (though others will argue this was already the case on '�d� Ẁ�d�'). VANDER would sing the lead-vocals in a very extravert and experimental way and funk, gospel, eastern music can be found amongst the material. Both '�d� Ẁ�d�'' and 'Attahk' are plagued by their muddy recording quality and blessed by the open experimental mindset of the band at the time. MAGMA was disbanded after 1978.

In 1984 the much debated 'Merci' was released under both the MAGMA and the Christian VANDER flag. This album features tracks full of soul, disco and funk influences and a typical eighties production. Though neglected by many fans of the band, others point out it's an album that can be enjoyed once perceived as a product of its time. In 1990 Seventh Records was founded, a record-company owned by VANDER that would release several live albums from the classic period as well as new releases to come.

In the year 2001, MAGMA-fans from all over the world celebrated the return of the band and the live document �Theusz Hamtaahk� was released, covering the complete trilogy played live. Quickly the band regained a top-notch reputation giving gigs of unbelievable precision and intensiveness for the avant-garde public. The new reincarnation would feature Christian VANDER, Estelle VANDER, guitar-player James MAC GAW, bass-player Philippe BUSSONET and a short list of male and female vocalists.

The highly acclaimed 'K.A.' Followed in 2004. This album consists mainly of pieces that already had been released on some live-albums dating from the classic line-up. The style, sound and feel of the album is remarkably faithful to the sound of classic era MAGMA. The album is the first piece of the K�hntark�sz-trilogy and chronicles the summoning of K�hntark�sz towards the tomb of �m�hnt�htt-R�. In 2009, the third part of this trilogy would be released, '�m�hnt�htt-R�', which proved to be a strong continuation artistically as well as a good entry-point for newcomers to the Koba�an saga.

In the years 2006-2008, the band would set out to play and record MAGMA pieces from throughout their career in a live setting, resulting in four volumes of live-footage of all MAGMA-era's with appearances of former band-members such as Jannick TOP and Klaus BLASQUIZ. This �Mythes Et L�gendes� series was extremely well received by fans of the band and proved that the band could still faithfully reproduce all its pieces, even the avant-prog/fusion pieces from the first two albums. Personally I would qualify this as one of the biggest achievements of progressive music in general.

In 2012, the band released the short album �F�licit� Th�sz� with a completely new 30 minute Zeuhl piece. This album stands out as the most accessible and optimistic feeling album of the band, whilst still being as well-composed and played as other 21st century recordings of the band.

In retrospection... In the end we still don't know whether the fearful dream that was the starting point for the story of MAGMA is to become reality. Yet it had led to one of the most artistically and technically well developed musical movements of 20th & 21st century music. MAGMA is attractive for its imagination, for its untouchable larger-then-life atmospheres, and for its fearless artistic attitude. Looking back on writing this biography, I think I can state that what makes the band different from all other bands in the world is that some bands gave us extended song-writing, others gave us new atmospheres to dwell into, but MAGMA gave its music a self-invented cultural framework from which the music can be perceived. MAGMA-fans themselves turn into Koba�ans -- for at least as long as the music takes, tuning into the imagination of Christian VANDER: the man who was a drummer, vocalist, composer, and perhaps above all, a musical social architect.

e051,ROBERT WYATT,United Kingdom,Canterbury Scene,,,artiste051.html?id=1035,,,,,,"Robert Wyatt biography

Robert Wyatt Ellidge

- Born January 28, 1945 (Bristol, England)

WYATT must hold a special place in many proghead's hearts as he was at the forefront of the progressive movement from 66 until his grave fall from a fourth story window which has kept him in a wheelchair. Even since then, Robert has been a real prog talent. He had started in the

WILDE FLOWERS

(which split into

SOFT MACHINE

and

CARAVAN

) and held the drum stool and singing mike for years before leaving to found

MATCHING MOLE

(a pun from the French translation of his former group MACHINE MOLLE) but had also participated to many projects involving many musicians at the forefront of progressive music before his fall.

While at the hospital, he started to write one of the most personal and intimate album ever ""Rock Bottom"", realizing that he would never walk again let alone drumming. He also took another approach to songwriting as he also realized that he would never be in a band anymore and therefore would not write songs according to the musicians in the group. The following albums will be less interesting for progheads and his discography become erratic. Only in the last years will he come back with new albums, some superb.

WYATT is one of the great musicians focused upon in Prog Archives and every proghead should investigate his oeuvre.

GONG is a Space/Canterbury Rock group formed by Australian guitarist (formerly of

SOFT MACHINE

)

Daevid ALLEN

. He did not do it alone though, he & his wife, Gilli Smyth are the whole nucleus of that band with numerous band line-ups. ""Magick Brother, Mystic Sister"" is GONG's first release & the line up consists of:

Didier MALHERBE

(sax), Christian Tritsch (guitar),

Pip PYLE

(drums) & of course, Daevid Allen (guitar & lead vocals) while his wife Gilli performed the spacey vocals. GONG's second release: ""Camembert Electrique"" is the beginning of Allan's ideas of Pot Head pixies, Radio Gnome's, & Octave Doctor's featured on later albums of ""The Radio Gnome Invisible Trilogy"" along with the Protagonist Zero The Hero, which consisted of ""Flying Teapot"" (1972), ""Angel's Egg"" (1973) & ""You"" (1974). After ""Camembert Electrique"" release also saw a new line-up & a steady one. The line-up consisted of: Didier Malherbe (sax) Mike Howlett (bass), Pierre Moerlen (drums),

Steve HILLAGE

(guitar), Tim Blake (synthesizers) & of course, Daevid (vocals & guitar) & Gilli (space vocals). This line-up would last until ""You"". When Allen, Smyth, & Blake departed due to dissatisfaction of being an instrumental band this led Pierre to be the leader & released ""Shamal"" in 1976. Hillage lost faith in the group & departed as well.

All of the ""Radio Gnome Trilogy"" albums & ""Camembert Electrique"" are great places to start for anyone interesting in GONG. ""Magick Brother, Mystic Sister"" is very raw, & not as technical or jam worthy as later GONG, but the Canterbury humor is still there. ""Shamal"" is the beginning of their Fusion sound that would be later presented on later albums. ""Gong Live"" features a good compilation of tracks performed live would also be good starter album.

3dd2,PINK FLOYD,United Kingdom,Psychedelic/Space Rock,,,artist3dd2.html?id=364,,,,,,"Formed in 1965 in London, UK - Disbanded in 1994 - Reunited with different formation on several ocasions

One of the biggest bands of all time

Of all the bands who come under the progressive rock banner, Pink Floyd are, arguably, the act most recognisable in the wider music community to music lovers of all genres. Yet, as revealed famously by Nick Mason in an old interview, even at the height of their fame, they could walk down any street, and passers-by would not have recognised a member of one of the most commercially successful acts in music history.

The band were formed in London in 1965, the original members being

Roger (known as Syd) BARRETT

on vocals and lead guitar,

Nick MASON

on drums,

Roger WATERS

on bass guitar and vocals, and

Rick WRIGHT

on keyboards.

The London of the late 1960's was a melting pot of live acts and varying musical genres, and the band gained a cult following amongst the underground psychedelic crowd of the time. This expanded into a more public consciousness with a residency at the famous UFO Club, with a hypnotic light show and pulsating, often indescribable, sounds. This led to television appearances, most famously an interview and live performance on BBC The Look of the Week, with a rather bemused classical performer Hans Keller in tow. Waters was famously asked just why everything had to be so loud?!

This popularity led to the band signing to EMI, who in 1967 released two hit singles, Arnold Layne, which attracted controversy regarding its cross-dressing themes, and See Emily Play. They charted in the UK at 20 and 6 respectively.

The debut album which followed, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, is universally recognised as being hugely influential in rock music, beyond the narrow confines of psychedelia. It peaked at number 6 in the UK album charts in 1967, and the band continued to play not only their residency, but also increasing numbers of national gigs and festivals.

The strain, however, was beginning to tell on Barrett, and a fragile mental state, exacerbated by LSD, led to him becoming almost semi-detached from the band and wider reality. The situation became such that the band, at the end of 1967, drafted in

David GILMOUR

to play alongside, or instead of, Barrett at gigs. By early 1968, matters came to a head, with the band famously waiting for Barrett to arrive for transportation to a gig, not turning up, and, when asked if they should pick him up, an unnamed band member saying not to bother. It was the end of the band leader's tenure, and, as he would famously state in later years, Waters took up the mantle ""because no one else would"".

The period between Barrett leaving and the release of Meddle in 1971 saw the band continuing to experiment with varying musical forms, and varying degrees of success. The side long epic from Meddle, Echoes, became a soundtrack for several filmed projects, and the album can, in retrospect, be seen as the end to a transitional period, prior to world dominance.

That dominance came in 1973 with the release of Dark Side Of The Moon. Many critics and fans alike have wondered why this album came to be so hugely popular. Nobody had ever really heard anything like it before, with its live recordings of workers at, or passing by, Abbey Road studios ruminating on life, death, the universe, and everything, its use of terrific sound effects, massive themes, operatic solos, interspersed with a huge hit single in Money. Certainly, the album is a landmark of progressive excellence, but it was also lucky in its success. As with Oldfield's Tubular Bells, the album was released just as cheap high street credit enabled music lovers to own the modern hi-fi systems which brought the exceptional sound engineering of Alan Parsons to vivid life. The album was both a product and symbol of its time.

Dark Side charted for years, and, to this day, sells in its millions.

The 1975 follow-up, Wish You Were Here, more grandiose in scope than its predecessor, also topped the charts worldwide. The Floyd bestrode the world as its undisputed commercial rock leaders.

The success, though, took its toll. Barrett, who had mysteriously turned up at the recording of Wish You Were Here, in an abject state, not even recognisable at first sight, had become mentally ill and detached from the wider world. Waters became detached from the band he led, perhaps because of the mental tensions of a communist having to deal with such vast sums of money and fame. He certainly felt that, when the band reconvened for the recording of the successor album, his bandmates, and Wright in particular, were not pulling their weight, and the resultant Animals, released in 1977, was, a Gilmour collaboration on one track aside, entirely his work. The band were becoming a Waters backing outfit, and the invective in this album, described by more than a few as the finest punk rock album of all time, was quite shocking. The album was also famous for the publicity stunt of a giant inflatable pig leaving its moorings at Battersea Park, London, and disrupting flights into and out of the city.

The resultant tour became famous for the inspiration behind the music and lyrics which would eventually be recorded as The Wall, when Waters spat on a fan screaming a little bit too enthusiastically in a musical passage, thus cementing, to him, the disconnect which had arisen between band and fans in the large stadia they were playing (although this did not prevent, in later years, Waters touring in such venues as a solo artist).

The Animals tour was not the only reason for The Wall coming to life. In 1978, financial investment firm Norton-Warburg crashed, with much of The Floyd's money crashing with it. Suddenly, the band found themselves on the verge of financial ruin, and a new album and tour became not so much a musical necessity, as an exercise in sheer survival.

The Wall was released in 1979, and, again, topped the charts worldwide. The theatrical tour, with Waters and the band hidden literally by a wall built during the show, prior to being torn down revealing the author's innermost fears and prejudices, was ground-breaking and breath-taking in its scope. The band, though, were falling apart. First to go was Richard Wright, who was fired by Waters, with, he has always insisted, the full participation of Mason & Gilmour. Wright did, though, take full part in the world tour, although on a salary (Gilmour later said that Wright, as a result, was the only member who made money out of an incredibly expensive tour). The band, by now, were barely speaking to each other.

Waters, Gilmour, and Mason (although the latter not on all the album) did reconvene for one last recording, the aptly titled The Final Cut, released in 1983. The album sold well, but nowhere near as much as previous works, and was described by Mason as the shining example of how not to make an album. It was, in effect, a Waters solo album in all but name. Waters subsequently left the band, with Mason, again, wryly observing that if he had really wanted to call a halt to proceedings, he would have been better remaining inside, and merely not bothering to do anything.

The band had now lost two hugely influential leaders over time in Barrett and Waters, but Gilmour and Mason, doggedly, refused to give up, and, with a rehired Richard Wright (on a salary), they proceeded to delight the rock music world with the announcement and recording of a new album, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, in 1987. The album was musically the work of Gilmour, with lyrics penned by a variety of contributors. The decision, which was a risk financially for Gilmour & Mason, was more than justified in terms of commercial success. It was more of a mainstream Floyd rock album than its immediate predecessors, and the subsequent, huge, world tours which resulted utilised, to incredible effect, the massive advancements which had arisen in digital technology. Pink Floyd were, once again, at the top of the tree in terms of critical and commercial success.

The band were to release one more album, The Division Bell, in 1994, with Wright returning to co and sole song writing duties for the first time in some 19 years, and Gilmour's wife, Polly Samson, writing the bulk of the lyrics to Gilmour's music. The album, single High Hopes, and tour were a massive commercial success again.

The album would prove to be the band's recording swansong, although both Waters and Gilmour continued to release solo albums. In 2005, at the insistence of the inimitable Bob Geldof, the classic line-up reconvened for a live performance one last time, with a short set of classics from Dark Side, Wish, and The Wall. In 2006, Barrett died from cancer, and, in 2008, Wright died of the same condition, the latter demise putting paid to any hope the music world might have had of more Floyd, although both surviving members have played together on Waters solo tour of The Wall.

Pink Floyd are listed on the Prog Archives site as belonging to the Psychedelic/Space Rock sub-genre. In reality, that period ended in the early 1970's, and they became so much more than that. For anyone wishing to explore the era of 1970's musical behemoths bestriding the rock world, The Pink Floyd are simply an essential part of that musical journey.

e2ef,FRANK ZAPPA,United States,RIO/Avant-Prog,,,artiste2ef.html?id=1023,,,,,,"Frank Vincent ZAPPA

- December 12, 1940 (Baltimore, USA) / December 4, 1993 (Los Angeles, USA)

When he was 10 years old, he moved to California with his parents. The first instrument he played was the drums. At that time, Frank ZAPPA really liked rhythm and blues music. But in 1954, ZAPPA found a copy of ""The Complete Works Of Edgar Var�se, Vol. One"". He was fascinated by the 'weird' avant-garde pieces and it was probably also ZAPPA's first encounter with atonal compositions, something that would later reappear in his own music. During high school, he played in several garage bands, but he didn't write rock and roll music himself until his early twenties. He began writing classical music at 18. Some of his early compositions he wrote for the B-films ""The World's Greatest Sinner"" and ""Run Home Slow"" (written by his high school English teacher). You can find the theme from ""Run Home Slow"" on the ""The Lost Episodes"" and ""The Mystery Disc"". From 1962 'til 1964, ZAPPA wrote several songs for different bands (You can find those songs on ""Cucamonga"" and ""For Collectors Only""). In 1964 ZAPPA entered THE SOUL GIANTS. He renamed the band THE MOTHERS (which was a subtle abbreviation of 'motherfuckers') and soon after the band caught the attention of producer Tom Wilson. THE MOTHERS were contracted by the Verve-division of MGM and after they had changed their name into THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION (to satisfy some MGM Records executives, who thought the other name was too provocative), they released 'Freak Out!', the second double-album ever (after Bob DYLAN's ""Blonde On Blonde"") and also what is said to be the first concept album ever. This milestone contained a strange mix of rhythm and blues, satyrical lyrics and avant-garde dissonance. With this first edition of THE MOTHERS, Frank ZAPPA recorded a number of progressive rock masterpieces. All of his records from the sixties are fantastic, except for ""Cruising With Ruben & The Jets"", which is a satiric tribute to doo-wop music. Worth mentioning is the fabulous ""We're Only In It For The Money"", on which ZAPPA ridicules the hippie-culture in general, and ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" from THE BEATLES in particular. The entire sleeve of ""We're Only In It For The Money"" is a parody on that record. On August 20, 1969, ZAPPA disbanded THE MOTHERS. The most important members of the early MOTHERS OF INVENTION had been Frank ZAPPA (guitar, vocals, much more) Ray COLLINS (vocals), Jimmy Carl BLACK (the indian of the group, drums and percussion), Roy ESTRADA (bass, vocals), Don PRESTON (keyboards), Billy MUNDI (drums), Bunk GARDNER (winds), Jim 'Motorhead' SHERWOOD (winds), Ian UNDERWOOD (winds, piano) and Ruth UNDERWOOD (percussion). Some of those member would later reappear in other editions of ZAPPA's band.

In 1970, ZAPPA composed a new edition of THE MOTHERS, including Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan from THE TURTLES, also known as Flo & Eddie. This second edition didn't last very long either, because during a show in the Rainbow Theatre in London, ZAPPA was pushed off the stage by a crazy 'fan'. He was badly injured. After his recovery he reformed THE MOTHERS. At that moment, the band consisted of, amongst others: Ian and Ruth UNDERWOOD, Tom FOWLER (bass), Bruce FOWLER (trombone),

George DUKE

(keyboards),

Jean-Luc PONTY

(violin) and Napoleon Murphy BROCK (saxophone) and most of the time, ZAPPA was the lead vocalist and guitarist. In this (legendary) line-up, ZAPPA recorded a few more accessible, funny bluesrock records. While some fans of the early MOTHERS didn't like what he was doing at that moment, other consider the albums ""Over-Nite Sensation"", ""Apostrophe (')"" and ""One Size Fits All"" as his finest moments. I think both periods of his career are fantastic. It was during the seventies, that ZAPPA also started experimenting with overdubs and he recorded an album with his high school friend Don VAN VLIET (CAPTAIN BEEFHEART). The tour from 1975 and 1976 (with Terry BOZZIO on drums) was the last one under the name of THE MOTHERS.

Now ZAPPA officially went 'solo'. During the late seventies and early eighties, he worked with Terry BOZZIO (drums), Adrian BELEW (guitar, vocals), Tommy MARS (keyboards, vocals), Patrick O'HEARN (bass), Eddie JOBSON (violin, keyboards), Ray WHITE (guitar, vocals) and Ike WILLIS (guitar, vocals). In 1979, ZAPPA recorded ""Joe's Garage"", a rock opera about what would happen if music became illegal. In the eighties, ZAPPA was very busy. He recorded the ""Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar"" - series and ""Guitar"", on which he showed what a good guitarist he had become. Besides that, he recorded a few albums (some of them pretty heavy) with a partly new band, including Ray WHITE, Ike WILLIS, Tommy MARS, Bobby MARTIN (keyboards, vocals), Scott THUNES (bass), Chad WACKERMAN (drums), Ed MANN (percussion) and (sometimes) Steve VAI (guitar). ZAPPA also went to Capitol Hill, to fight censorship (the Parents Music Resource Center was planning to label all albums that included 'explicit lyrics'). Pieces from the hearing can be found on ""Frank Zappa Meets The Mothers Of Prevention"". In the same time, he started experimenting with the synclavier. After a big quarrel in 1988, ZAPPA decided to fire almost the entire band. He was fed-up with working with a band, so he filled the rest of his life playing guitar and synclavier, releasing the ""You Can't That On Stage Anymore"" live compilations and doing 'classical' music projects, such as ""The Yellow Shark"". He even continued working when doctors had discovered that he was suffering from prostate cancer. When Frank Vincent ZAPPA died on December 4, 1993 at age 52, the world lost one of his greatest innovators, critics, and composers.

Here's a small list of ZAPPA-records I recommend. They're all must-haves, and some of them may be a good starting point for people who are unfamiliar with his work. Firstly, all of his albums with the early MOTHERS (except for ""Cruising With Ruben & The Jets"") are very good. I think the best ones are ""We're Only In It For The Money"", ""Uncle Meat"" and ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh"". ""Freak Out!"" is less interesting, but it does have great historical value, for it was, in my opinion, the first progressive rock record ever. Zappa's second solo-album ""Hot Rats"" contains some great instrumental (except for CAPTAIN BEEFHEART's vocals on ""Willie The Pimp"") jazzrock. ""Hot Rats"" is definitily among his best albums. But, if you are unfamiliar with ZAPPA's work, the albums of THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION and ZAPPA's solo-albums from the sixties may scare you off. If you'd like some more accessible music, you could start with ""Over-Nite Sensation"", ""Apostrophe (')"" or ""One Size Fits All"". They're all great jazzy bluesrock records. ZAPPA's most poppy record was the controversial ""Sheik Yerbouti"" though. It contains many accessible ZAPPA-classics, with very funny lyrics. You could also start with a compilation. ""Strictly Commercial"", ""Have I Offended Someone?"", ""Cheap Thrills"" and ""Son Of Cheep Thrills"" are all decent compilations, that give you a nice insight in what diverse kinds of music Frank ZAPPA made.

dc9b,QUEENSRYCHE,United States,Progressive Metal,,,artistdc9b.html?id=674,,,,,,"Founded in    Bellevue, Washington, USA in 1981 (as The Mob) - Still active as of 2019

Quite simply, Queensryche was one of the essential bands in the development of progressive metal. Merging the metal of Iron Maiden with the atmospheres of Pink Floyd, the band created what may still be the quintessential metal concept album, OPERATION: MINDCRIME. The band's sound has centered on the operatic vocals of Geoff Tate singing over numerous versions of heavy rock over a 30 year career.

Starting in the early 1980's in Seattle, Washington, guitarists Chris Degarmo and Michael Wilton, along with bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield, were in a cover band, the Mob, cutting their teeth on the work of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Singer Geoff Tate of local progressive bands Babylon and the Myth was brought in sporadically for gigs and then an EP. The EP, fueled by the anthemic ""Queen of the Reich"" gained the band national exposure. The band acquired Tate permanently, changed their name in honor of their then signature song, and were signed to EMI.

Initially tagged as an Iron Maiden descendent, Queensryche folded in more and more progressive influences under Tate and DeGarmo's direction on the LPs THE WARNING and RAGE FOR ORDER. The latter is one of several albums that may be considered the first true progressive metal album, as it melded keyboards, conceptual themes, and more complex song structures. However, Queensryche's defining moment was the full concept album from 1988, OPERATION: MINDCRIME. Its ambitious story covered government, religion, sex, drugs, and mental illness. The interconnected songs included an over ten minute epic, several MTV hit singles, and fueled the band's rise supporting several of the top metal tours of the time.

The following album, EMPIRE, took an intentionally more commercial tone and catapulted the band to major arenas where they performed MINDCRIME in its entirety as a headliner. The Pink Floyd influenced single ""Silent Lucidity"" was one of the major hits of the year. This would be the band's peak with eclectic PROMISED LAND being the last of the band's classic era. Musical tastes had changed, and the band attempted unsuccessfully to accommodate to alternative / grunge with HEAR IN THE NOW FRONTIER. DeGarmo left the band soon after, and Queensryche has had an up and down career. TRIBE and OPERATION: MINDCRIME II were much better received than their predecessors, and the band's continuing tours have included co-headlining with fellow prog-metal pioneers Dream Theater. Though never reaching their early 90's heights, the band still produces ""thinking man's metal,"" and their place in the history of progressive metal is without question."

Founded in 1969 - Disbanded in 1987 - Reformed between 1998-2002 and again since 2009

There were two groups under the banner of RENAISSANCE. The first group included Keith and Jane RELF (vocals) and came from the YARDBIRDS ashes. The second and better known incarnation produced some of the best music that I have ever heard. Annie HASLAM's five octave range fit perfectly with the classical/orchestral rock (lot of piano playing & full symphony orchestra backup) created by the other members. The quick description I usually give is they are sort of like the old MOODY BLUES with a an incredible female vocalist. The soprano voice of Annie and the piano virtuosity of John TOUT allied to the beauty and refreshing melodies, the refinement of the arrangements gave their music its magnificent splendour.

Photo by Brian Tirpak

My favorite RENAISSANCE albums are ""Ashes Are Burning"" and ""Turn of the Cards"". I also recommend ""Novella"", ""Scheherezade and Other Stories"" and ""A Song for All Seasons"" are must haves. I would add ""Live At Carneige Hall"" and ""King Biscuit Hour Parts 1 and 2"" as their 'prime' material. Plenty to fill a day with class, power and ethereal delights. The best introduction to the band would be the ""Tales of 1001 Nights"" compilation, which together contain of the band's best material from 72 through 80. Also the very first album from '69 is essential. After 1979, the band moved towards a more pop direction, like many other bands did in the late 70's.

Founded in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1969 - disbanded in 1978 - reunited 1985, 1990, 1999 - reformed in 2002

Of all the groups in the 1970s that combined elements of rock and classical music, FOCUS is, without a doubt, the most notable Dutch group widely known outside the Netherlands. This band has created excitement all over the world during the past few years with their unique sound and musical approach. The two main musicians in the band were flutist/keyboardist/singer Thijs Van LEER and guitarist

Jan AKKERMAN

. They played a stylishly inventive rock with flutes, keyboards & dazzling guitar, defining the Dutch prog sound. An inspiration to FINCH, TRACE & numerous others. In 1978, the group finally split up, without making too much noise.

Best albums are ""Moving Waves"" (1972), ""3"" (1973), ""Live at the Rainbow"" (1973), and ""Hamburger Concerto"" (1974). ""Waves"" and ""3"" represent the best of the band's earlier intensely progressive period with plenty of sidelong tracks and healthly extended solos. Most will agree that ""Live at the Rainbow"" and ""Hamburger Concerto"" (last good album) were their best, moving into a period of more pure classical and jazz influence.

""Focus 8"" marks the return of Thijs Van LEER in the true nature of music: tuneful, memorable and a little bit rocky when they want to be. This album contains everything you might want from a FOCUS album ... plenty of flute and keyboards from Thijs, tasty guitar playing from Jan DUM�E and even some yodeling vocals. Perhaps in summary, the band could have veered a little from the safety of the FOCUS blueprint but ""Focus 9"" may yet further develop their own voice. No doubt about it, we'll have to count on FOCUS in the new millennium to all of the true Progressive Rock lovers."

Founded in   Orlando, USA in 1983 (as MANTAS) - Renamed in 1984 - Disbanded in 1998

Chuck Schuldiner founded Death in the early 80s as an extreme metal band, not knowing that in the years to come the band would be celebrated by many as the band which created the genre of Death Metal. During the years the lineup changed frequently, with Schuldiner as the constant element. Their music got more and more complex in the 90s, and their last releases Individual Thought Patterns, Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance are the reason for their inclusion in the archives. The music on these albums is what is today often referred to as ""Progressive Death Metal"", and it influenced many other bands in the following years which further explored the possibilities of this new kind of music. Eventually Schuldiner founded the band Control Denied, which essentially continued Death's evolution towards a more experimental music - their first release is very similar to Death, minus the typical Death Metal vocals. After the release of that album in 1999 Schuldiner was diagnosed with brain-stem cancer, and due to this disease both Control Denied and Death were put on hold, and in 2001 Schuldiner lost his battle with his illness.

Why this artist must be listed in www.progarchives.com :

Death can be seen as the founding fathers of two genres: Death Metal and Progressive Death Metal. While their first 4 studio are not progressive, the remaining 3 show an amazing development of more and more experimental structures.

Agreed. But both ""The Rotter's Club"" and their self titled first are easily the best albums of the mid 70s. Basically ""TRC"" is probably the next step the average prog fan should take into exploring Canterbury after CARAVAN's best albums. This is outstanding music - Canterbury at its best!"

Beloved Symphonic prog rock through to stadium filling rock titans

Any biography of Genesis must recognise that there are distinct periods in the band's history, and that any discussion should recognise that musically and lyrically, the band which filled vast stadia throughout the 1990's was a completely different creature to that which played sweaty student halls filled with spotty young men in the early 1970's.

The original incarnation of the band had its origins in two outfits formed by

Peter GABRIEL

(vocals & flute),

Tony BANKS

(keyboards),

Michael RUTHERFORD

(bass & rhythm guitars), and

Anthony PHILLIPS

(lead guitars) whilst boarding students at the elite English public school, Charterhouse in the mid-1960's. Outside the confines of an extremely stuffy atmosphere, the world was becoming far more liberated, socially, sexually, politically, and musically, and these bands represented an outlet for young men who, basically, as young men do, wanted some of that.

The two acts coalesced into one, and the students had the novel idea of placing a tape of their music into the hands of Jonathan King whilst he was visiting his alma mater. King was, at this time, a big selling artist and musical impresario, and, consequently, someone who mattered in the rock world.

The tapes were basic, but King took a shine to Gabriel's voice, and recognised a unique sound and talent which, if nurtured, could become huge. He arranged for the band, with drummer Chris Stewart, to record some sessions in London, where the boys experimented with quite complex, orchestral pastiches. Knowing that King was not happy, the band penned Silent Sun, a song which was essentially a Bee Gees tribute single. The brothers Gibb were huge commercially at this time, and King was known to be a huge fan. The resulting album in early 1969 was named ""Genesis to Revelation"" by King, as representing something brand new and exciting in the musical world. It barely scratched the surface of the commercial music world, and, for many a year after, copies could still be found in the bargain bin section of stores.

Following this, there was, initially, some doubt as to whether the musical careers would survive leaving school. Parental pressures were particularly acute on Rutherford, whose parents had virtually guaranteed him a scholarship with the British Foreign Office. However, a decision was taken to further the music, and, with new drummer John Mayhew (not a schoolmate) in tow, the band began to gig extensively, picking up admirers in the burgeoning progressive rock scene which was bursting out in student halls across the UK.

King had, by now, lost interest, but the band were lucky when, on a recommendation, Tony Stratton-Smith, a legendary Soho impresario and founder of Charisma Records, saw them live, fell in love with, particularly, a live version of what was to be later recorded as Visions of Angels, and signed them up virtually there and then. The key to this signing was the artistic freedom afforded by the label to the band to produce the music they wanted to produce, and, crucially, the time required to build a following, something which would be next to impossible in the modern world, with its record executives generally having the attention span of the average gnat.

The first Charisma release was Trespass in late 1970, a collection of complex songs which belied the youth and relative inexperience of the band. As strange as it may seem, the band continued to play music from this album right up to the final live shows of 2007, with elements of Stagnation forming part of the classic instrumental medley regularly played at gigs. Most recognise that the highlight of the work was the furiously paced, radical, revolutionary rock track The Knife, which was the album, and live show, closer. It became a hit in Belgium in 1971, helping to propel the album to number one in the charts there.

The extensive touring was, though, beginning to take a toll on Phillips, who began to suffer from acute stage fright, this becoming so bad that he made the decision to quit. His departure was a body blow to the band, because Phillips was far more in terms of song-writing and playing one fifth of the outfit. Phillips would subsequently become a music teacher, and launched his own (studio based) solo career in 1977, encompassing a range of musical styles. Despite the loss, the decision was taken to carry on and to replace Mayhew, who had serious musical limitations, at the same time.

Steve HACKETT

on guitar was recruited on the back of an advert he had placed in the music newspaper Melody Maker, in which stated he wished to join ""receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms"". Phil Collins on drums attended auditions held at the rather grand Gabriel residence, and learned the songs being played to and by other auditionees whilst relaxing in an outside swimming pool. By the time his turn came, he was note perfect!

As grave as the loss of Phillips must have been, Genesis had added two exceptional musicians. Collins came to be regarded as one of the finest rock drummers in the world, and he had the added advantage of being able to provide decent backing vocals to Gabriel. On the first album released by the line-up, Nursery Cryme in 1971, Collins sang (uncredited) lead vocals on the short For Absent Friends.

The album did not sell particularly well in the UK, where the band were still very much a cult act, but did break big in Italy. Belgium also continued its commercial affair with the band, and, as a result, the band toured extensively on the continent, and made several television appearances, some of which can still be viewed in varying degrees of quality, on YouTube.

The breakthrough, though, was with the release of Foxtrot in 1972, featuring at its heart a sprawling epic on the second side, Supper's Ready, with its patchwork of differing ideas and tunes brought together to stunning effect and, literally, Biblical epoch. On the resulting tour, the stage costumes and theatrical persona of Gabriel began to take shape. He caused no end of controversy in Eire when he leapt onto the stage in a lady's dress and fox head, a la the stunning album cover drawn by Paul Whitehead. An old man's mask was worn to frightening effect in the closing stages of Nursery Cryme, telling the story of a love unrequited, and unfulfilled. The mask of the Magog in the Suppers Ready passage Apocalypse in 9/8 was distinctly creepy and dark, whilst the flower head in The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man was simply silly. A Genesis gig at this time was becoming an event, visual as well as oral, and it is fair to say that the oral side was becoming more and more accomplished.

The follow-up, Selling England by the Pound, consolidated the progress made, and even spawned a hit single in I Know What I Like. Highly recommended for those wishing to get a flavour of the live act in this period is the initial Archive (1967-1975) boxset release of 1998, which has a 1973 set from The Rainbow theatre. The first two CD's of this boxset have the entire live performance (barring the denouement, It, which was lost, and subsequently re-recorded by the band in the studio) of the subsequent album release, the sprawling Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, a double concept album released in 1974 about a Puerto Rican youth living in New York with dual personality issues.

The Lamb was incredibly adventurous, and remains a firm progressive rock favourite to this day. However, it marked the end of the ""classic"" line-up of the band, and the strains had begun to show even before Gabriel announced to the press in a statement that he was leaving. Banks has subsequently gone on record to state he never really ""got"" the concept of the album, the costumes worn by Gabriel, in particular the Slipperman bubble suit, were thought by his bandmates to be becoming a real distraction to the music, and the recording of the album itself was marred by Gabriel's first child almost dying after birth, and the not altogether sympathetic reaction of the remainder did not go down well.

Upon the news becoming public, Melody Maker printed a front cover proclaiming ""The death of Genesis"", but they, and the wider music community, had not reckoned with the sheer stubbornness of the remainder of the band. Auditions began for a new lead singer, including, amusingly, one Nick Lowe, who went on to become a darling of the post punk New Wave scene. Eventually, the band decided that they already had a replacement in house in the form of their drummer. A commercial rock behemoth was born. In the subsequent live period,

Bill BRUFORD

, formerly of Yes & King Crimson, guested on drums, but he refused a permanent live role, and was replaced by Chester Thompson of The Weather Report and Frank Zappa for all live work to significant effect, in tandem with Collins on instrumental passages.

The four-piece band released, in what is known as the ""middle period"", two albums, both of which still retain massive affection in the progressive rock world in terms of the symphonic excellence demonstrated on Trick of the Tail (said to be the late Princess Diana's favourite album) and Wind & Wuthering. There was, though, a chilly wind blowing. Punk was born in this period, its spittle fuelled violence spewing against all things prog, and Hackett was becoming disenchanted with the direction the band were taking musically. The remaining three tried to provide additional song-writing credits to Hackett on Wind & Wuthering, but to no avail, and, in 1977, he left to pursue an eclectic solo career, taking with him songs he felt had been unfairly rejected by the band. A subsequent interview with the band (Genesis: Together & Apart) in 2014 showed that the tensions of this split still ran deep, certainly as far as Banks was concerned. The double album Seconds Out does, though, capture the incredible live experience of this time and line-up extremely well. For live duties, Hackett was replaced by

Daryl STUERMER

(who also played bass guitar on the later penned tracks to Rutherford's lead guitar), who had recorded with Jean-Luc Ponty.

The remaining three doggedly continued, and, thus, the later period of the band started. Each release, starting with And Then There Were Three in 1978, and culminating in We Can't Dance in 1991, sold more than the previous work, and each tour saw the band playing to ever larger audiences and stadia. They became huge, began to specifically write, and have, hit singles, and there is still much controversy in the progressive rock community as to the direction taken, specifically with most of the vitriol being directed at one Mr Collins, who, after the release of his debut solo album, Face Value, which included tracks rejected by the band in the rehearsals for Duke, became probably the most unlikely superstar in music in the history of unlikely superstars. Numerous interviews with the band have demonstrated the unfairness of this vitriol. Both Rutherford & Banks have made it clear that all the material written for much of Duke, and all albums after Abacab, were group material, born of jamming ideas and gelling them together at their custom-made studio. Banks is on record as stating that, although his preference musically was for the longer pieces, it was certainly extremely pleasant, not to say lucrative, to have hit singles.

All the albums of this period included recognisably progressive tracks, and some famous sprawling epics, and the live shows were careful to include such favourites for the older fans, who were now joined by persons of the female form not previously seen at a Genesis show. In truth, the band became what could be deemed a progressive pop/rock outfit, or ""Crossover Prog"" as it is termed on this site. Whether one loves, or hates, this (and opinion is certainly still split), nobody could deny not just the success it brought, but the fact that the musicianship was still never less than superb. Many fans were also introduced to the more symphonic past of the band because of the later works, thus serving as a good introduction to the history of progressive rock.

It didn't last. In 1996, Collins left to concentrate on his stellar career in music, television, and films. Nick Mason, of Pink Floyd, was, though, to later remark, on being asked how bands should break up,  ""Genesis. I wish we could have broken up like Genesis"", i.e. on the best of terms.

Banks & Rutherford, the latter despite a successful act, Mike & The Mechanics, decided to carry on, and recruited as lead singer Ray Wilson, who had had a small measure of success with Stiltskin. The resulting album, Calling All Stations, released in 1997, did not exactly bomb, but it was, perhaps unfairly, not a critical success, and certainly did not sell anywhere near as well as its predecessor albums. Live, they were now playing venues the size of Manchester Indoor Arena, whereas with Collins, it was venues the size of Wembley Stadium. Banks & Rutherford, who had signed Wilson on a two-year deal, called it a day.

In 2007, Collins, Rutherford, and Banks, with Thompson and Stuermer back on board live, embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour, without any album to promote. It proved, beyond all doubt, that there was only one line-up the wider public would flock to see.

That, compilation albums and anthology interviews aside, was the last Genesis activity as this bio is written. Rumours continue to persist, however, of plans for one last reunion tour, although whether Gabriel, at the age of 67 would want to prance around the stage playing a 20-odd year-old Puerto Rican punk is another matter.

Genesis, all iterations of Genesis, are simply essential progressive rock. It is a fair summary to state that no student of the genre could possibly ignore the history and music of this seminal act.

CARAVAN were the other half of the

WILDE FLOWERS

- the

SOFT MACHINE

being the other - that originated in Canterbury, Kent. The band itself was originally formed in early 1968 by guitarist/vocalist Pye HASTINGS, keyboardist

Dave SINCLAIR

, bassist/vocalist

Richard SINCLAIR

(later of

HATFIELD & THE NORTH

,

NATIONAL HEALTH

, etc.), and drummer Richard COUGHLAN. All four members of CARAVAN were, at one time or another, in that band. They were a leading exponent of what became known as ""the Canterbury sound"".

The band's 1968 self-titled debut was a hybrid of jazz and psychedelia. Things became serious with the second album, ""If I Could Do It All Over Again,I'd Do It All Over You"" and would mark the start of their classic period. The material was a very original mixture of styles including classical, jazz, and traditional English influences. A MILESTONE IN THEIR HISTORY. This recipe was used to great success on the next album, ""In the Land of Grey and Pink"". This album was a perfect blend between simple northern-English pop and complex progressive rock. Quite simply one of the greatest progressive rock classics. The style dominated the next album, ""Waterloo Lily"", released in May of 1972, which marked a clear step towards jazz. Yet, Richard SINCLAIR's influence was clearly apparent on the first side. ""For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night"" marked another change in the band's sound, this time towards a more streamlined symphonic approach. This album is not a bad album taken by itself, but the classic Canterbury sound stopped here. For a more representative look at CARAVAN in their prime, check out the preceding three albums. This lineup also recorded the live album ""Caravan and the New Symphonia"", a  live 1973 performance accompanied by a full orchestra.

""Cunning Stunts"" (1975) marked the beginning of a series of mediocre releases and lineup changes, eventually leading to the reunion of the original members on ""Back to Front"". Many different compilations and live albums were released in the intervening twelve years before a new studio album, ""Battle of Hastings"", which was released in 1995. This album was a nice collection of poppy tunes retaining the classic CARAVAN sound (organ, violin, flute, sax and HASTINGS' inimitable vocals). CARAVAN is still active today, playing many live dates in Britain and Holland and in 2000 saw the beginning of renewed activity (festival, concert, etc.). In February 2001, all the albums from ""If I Could..."" to ""Cunning Stunts"" were reissued with a myriad of bonus material, copious liner notes and impeccable sound quality. 2002 also saw the band plays their first performance in the United States in 28 years at NEARFEST 2002."
7520,PAIN OF SALVATION,Sweden,Progressive Metal,,,artist7520.html?id=284,,,,,,"Founded in  Eskilstuna, Sweden in 1984 (as ""Reality"") - Changed name in 1991 - Still active as of 2017

Pain of Salvation is widely known as one of the fundamental progressive metal bands from the second generation, which came around the mid 90's, but the fact is that the band is one of the oldest progressive metal bands still active. The band was formed by guitarist, singer and composer Daniel Gildenl�w and friends in 1984, two years after Fates Warning, Three years after Queensr�che and a year before Dream Theater, when Daniel was only 11 years old. At that time, the band was called Reality, but as Daniel got older he realized the band's name needed to changed, despite the band being basically the same. So, in 1991 the band officially changed from Reality to Pain of Salvation. Daniel, over the years, gave various different reasons for the change of name, but the common feature of all those explanations is the fact that the name symbolizes the balance between things of vital significance, such as good and bad, light and dark, life and death.

The band had numerous personnel changes, mostly during the Reality period and the early period of Pain of Salvation up until their second album. Since the release of One Hour by the Concrete Lake the band remained fairly stable, with only two important band member changes: when Kristoffer Gildenl�w, Daniel's brother, left in 2006 due to being unable to attend to rehearsals because he lived in Denmark, and when Johan Langell, Pain of Salvation's drummer since 1989, left in 2007 in order to focus on his own family.

After having a reasonably stable lineup for some time, Pain of Salvation decided, in 1996, to search for a record deal with some record label, but first recruited the keyboardist Fredrik Hermansson to complete the band's intended sound. During the rest of 1996 they distributed various demo tapes in hope to get signed with any interesting label. In early 1997 the band started recording their debut album in Roasting House, a professional recording studio in Sweden, and in August of the same year Entropia was released in Asia by Avalon, a Japanese record label owned by the Japanese record company Marquee, with generally positive response feedback, eventually leading to another licensing deal, this time with Romanian label SC Rocris Discs still in late 1997.

Entropia can be easily considered as the band's most musically diverse release up to today, raging from mellow passages to crushingly heavy ones, from complex Gentle Giant influenced songs to funky / black music influenced songs, from thoughtful and calm passages to distressful and energetic passages. Unlike posterior releases, however, Entropia does not focus on one theme or one storyline, having three stories being developed at the same time in the album.

At the time of Entropia's release, the band started to gain international attention, but nothing like what they experienced after the release of One Hour by the Concrete Lake, in 1998. The album had an ever bigger acclaim and had an even bigger positive reception than the band's debut album, receiving media coverage from specialized magazines all around the world and was considered as a darker Entropia. This album sparkled the attention of InsideOut, one of the major progressive music labels, to sign with the band between late 98 and early 99. As a result to that, the band's previous works were rereleased in Europe and USA in 1999. InsideOut still is Pain of Salvation's recording label to this day.

Despite being considered a masterpiece at the time, Gildenl�w sees One Hour by the Concrete Lake today as one of the band's least accomplishing albums, musically speaking, and it is not hard to understand why: though being a great piece of progressive metal, One Hour by the Concrete Lake's music is more homogeneous / is not such a melting pot of influences as the other Pain of Salvation's albums.

After a short break, the band recorded and released in the year 2000 the album The Perfect Element, part I. The album received a huge amount of praise from both the media and the fans all around the world.

The Perfect Element, part I showed the darkest side of the band yet, both musically and lyrically. The album had themes such as psychological and physical abuse during the childhood and adolescence, sexuality, drug abuse, love, pain, anger, loss, despair and shame, for example, and the various consequences and correlations those things had with the forming of a person. The music also goes with said themes and unveil and even darker side than the one showed in Concrete Lake, making The Perfect Element, part I one of the most dense progressive metal releases to date.

Still in 2000, the band toured on Europe in support of its album during September and October with neo-prog supergroup Arena. In February 2001, the band traveled for the first time to the USA to play in the ProgPower USA festival, as headliners and in late 2001 the band entered the studio once more to record Remedy Lane. Remedy Lane is Pain of Salvation's fourth album and was released in January 2002, being received very well by the progressive rock and progressive metal community and being regarded as the band's best work so far. Still in 2002, during the Remedy Lane tour, the band was invited by Dream Theater to be a special guest opener for their European tour of the album Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.

Remedy Lane is, along with all Pain of Salvation's albums, a concept album, but, unlike the other albums released by the band so far, the concept of Remedy Lane was both lighter (when compared with the other themes used in previous albums) and closer to the audience, since it treated about more earthly matters than previous albums (lost love, lust, the emotional feelings one may feel, human relationship, etc). The album is part autobiographical, because Daniel based the story of the album on an actual relationship he had.

A year after the release of Remedy Lane, in 2003, Pain of Salvation recorded a special acoustic concert for a crowd of special guests, which was released as the live album 12:5. That album was supposed to be more than a simply ""Unplugged"" album: all songs played, despite being inspired in actual Pain of Salvation songs, were actually re-interpretations or completely new songs that were based solely on few parts of the original song.

After the end of the Remedy lane tour, the band spent most of 2003 and 2004 working on their most ambitious project so far: a concept album which treats about the nature of existence of God and humankind and how one influences the other. That project would later become the band's 2004 album BE. The idea itself dates back to 1996 and Daniel Gildenl�w worked on the subject from time to time, but nothing serious or final was done until the period the band started to work on the concept, in the early 2000's.

Before being recorded, the material that would be in the album was performed in Eskilstuna a number of times in its entirety with costumes, stage props, screen projections and orchestra (the nine-part orchestra called The Orchestra of Eternity). After those performances, the concept and the music was further adjusted and refined and in February 2004 the band begun recording what would be known as the album BE.

BE was released in September 2004 and was the first album to divide the band's audience. That happened for a number of reasons: some fans felt the album was way too ambitious and was borderline incomprehensible, wile others felt the album lacked the progressive metal the band was so known for and entered too deep in the progressive rock field; others, mostly new fans that came from a progressive rock background that was attracted by the album's ""revolutionary sound, considered it the Pain of Salvation's best album yet.

Indeed, BE is very different from every other album in the band's catalogue, musically speaking. In that album, Pain of Salvation drops, for the most part, their progressive metal elements and deliver a very refined and complex progressive rock piece, which included the nine-part orchestra (The Orchestra of Eternity), along with an incredibly complex and intertwined concept which was presented and developed in a very small and limited amount of time, making both the music and the concept appear too dense for some as well as they appeared to be too lightly developed for others.

BE also featured the so-called ""God's Answering Machine in the song Vocari Dei, which consisted in a place where band fans would leave a message for God. People from around the world sent their messages for the Machine and the band used the material as part of the song, together with an instrumental piece. The joint instrumental music and the pleads to God created one of the most emotional songs the band has ever come up with so far.

Still in 2004, the band started its ""embargo"" on the USA due to the policy of fingerprinting all out of country visitors and due to the contempt for the Bush administration, for the part of Daniel Gildenl�w. The ""embargo"" was actually motivated by the fact that George W. Bush was the president of the USA, since, after Barrack Obama became the president the ""embargo"" was lifted, despite the fingerprinting policy still existing.

Roughly a year before the release of Scarsick, Daniel's brother, Kristoffer Gildenl�w, was asked to leave the band because he was unable to attend to the rehearsals. Since he was living in the Netherlands at that point and the rest of the band lived in Sweden, it was only natural that he could not go to rehearsals. After leaving the band, Kristoffer have been working on his own musical projects, being the 2007 album Synchronized, from the band Dial, the first to come to surface.

Three years after the release of BE, Pain of Salvation released their sixth album, Scarsick. This album is rather an unique on for the band for two reasons: first, it escapes the pattern of the modern band's sound (which would be characterized by the albums BE and Road Salt), which is heavily influenced by the 1970's rock music (progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, specially). Scarsick, for its turn, gets most of its base sound from the late 1990's and early 2000's new metal, a genre that, by the time the album was released, was already old news and endured a rather heavy amount of negative feedback. Second, the album is mostly song-and-band oriented, something that the band has never (fully) done before, though Entropia go through those places quite a few times. Naturally, the album met mixed reviews since it was released and still does over the years.

According to Daniel, Scarsick is the second part of the three-piece concept ""The Perfect Element"". The second presentation of the concept is entitled ""he"" and continues the story of the male character introduced on The perfect Element, Part I. Sacarsick has also different subjects and approaches from the first part of the concept. The latter deals with dysfunctions and psychological problems of the individual, wile the former deals with political and social problems.

Through the following years, the band would tour in support of their album, both inside and outside Europe. During this tour, their second live album and live DVD was recorded in one of their gigs, in Amsterdam. That was quite a courageous move, knowing that the album they were supporting on that same tour have had so many mixed feedback.

Still during their touring, in 2007, it was announced that long time drummer, Johan Langell would leave the band in order to focus to be able to focus on his family. In spite of that, he would remain in the band until the rest of the tour and until all drummer parts were teached to his replacement, which would be the French drummer Leo Margarit. In 2008, yet another line-up change happened. The bassist Simon Andersson, Kristoffer replacement, left the band. Since then, the band has used bassist player Per Schelander as a touring member.

The year of 2009 was a rather bad year of Pain of Salvation. Two major projects have to be canceled due to the bankruptcy of SPV, the owner of the band's record label InsideOut: the Progressive Nation 2009 tour, with Dream Theater and Beardfish, was canceled because of the sheer lack of funds. The PN 2009 would be the band's first time in the USA since the ""embargo"" started, back in 2004. Also, the release of the album Road Salt had to be postponed, also because of the bankruptcy of SPV. Although the band was unable to release the album, Daniel Gildenl�w stated, on an internet interview, that he had more time to work and mature the album, the songs and the concept with that ""extra time"" gained. With that ""extra time"" he also decided to release each part of the Road Salt album separately, with a timeframe of a year separating them.

Despite those two heavy hits, the band managed to take something positive out of the situation. First, Pain of Salvation was the supporting act on the Dream Theater tour through Australia, the first time the band has ever set foot on the country. In the second place, they managed to release an EP, after Century Media got its hands on InsideOut, which would be some kind of preview to the Road Salt album. Thirdly, they were classified to the Melodiefestivalen 2010, the Swedish leg of the Eurovision Music Contest of the same year, with the title track of the Road Salt album. That gave Pain of Salvation the biggest ever exposure to the Swedish public in their career.. They were disqualified on the Andra Chancen, however, and did not took part on the Eurovision.

On mid 2010, the first part of their newest album, Road Salt I: Ivory, was released. The album brought back the ""rock"" side of Pain of Salvation, previously seen on BE, back to the surface. Heavily influenced by the 70's, even more than BE, the band did everything they could to make the album sound as close as if it was recorded 40 years ago, even under producing themselves and muddying their sound / making it less clear.

The second part of the album, Road Slat II: Ebony, is planned to be released on the first part of 2011.

Undoubtedly one of the more adventurous, AREA were also a very important band on the seventies Italian prog scene, their first three albums in particular come highly recommended and essential listening to anyone discovering the RPI genre.

The band formed in 1972 stabilizing with a line-up of superb musicians for their debut album featuring ex I RIBELLI vocalist

Demetrio STRATOS

, ex I CALIFFI  guitarist Paulo Tofani, bassist Patrick Djivas (later to join PFM), drummer Giulio Capiozzo, keyboardist Patrizio Fariselli and on sax, flute and clarinet Victor Busnello. ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" (work will make your free) was released on Cramps records in 1973 and is a very accomplished debut by anyone's standards featuring an exciting blend jazz, rock and prog with Arabian and Greek (Stratos was Greek) influences along with a touch of the Avant. The bands lyrics show a politically left wing stance and Stratos was already displaying his inventive vocal style, using it as an instrument much of the time rather than in the traditional sense, something he would develop to further extremes on future albums (including solo work).

By 1974, when their second album ""Caution Radiation Area"" was released, Djivas had jumped ship for PFM being replaced by Ares Tavolazzi and Busnello also left but was not replaced. It's a harder listen than the debut leaning more towards the avant with a heavier emphasis on free jazz, once again the musicianship is exemplary and features some incredibly powerful moments. In comparison ""Crac!"" released in 1975 whilst still displaying the same inventive mix of styles was more accessible and is an ideal early port of call to the uninitiated. That year also saw the release of their first live album ""Are(A)zione"".

Two further studio albums followed where the band continued to expand their musical palette, ""Maledetti"" released in 1976 where the band used a host of other musicians to help out and ""1978 Gli Dei Se Ne Vanno, Gli Arrabbiati Restano"". By this point Tofani had left the band. It would also prove to be the last album to feature Stratos who sadly died of cancer in 1979 at the age of only 35.

The three remaining musicians attempted to continue bringing in some outside help in the brass department for the all instrumental album ""Tic & Tac"". Clearly Stratos was a talent too big to replace. Drummer Capiozzo continued in the eighties with a band called AREA II, but was the only original member, leaning more towards the pure jazz elements. He was reunited with Fariselli for one more AREA album, ""Chernobyl 7991"" released in 1996.

Whilst certainly not typical of the RPI genre AREA nevertheless remain an outstanding example of the inventive Italian prog scene. Not for the faint-hearted but for those looking for something more adventurous will find AREA a highly rewarding listening experience.

0b19,10CC,United Kingdom,Prog Related,,,artist0b19.html?id=2552,,,,,,"Formed in 1972, split in 1983 and reunited between 1991 and 1995.

Since 1999 a new version of the band has been touring but  no new recordings have been released.

Deriving their name from the metric total of semen ejaculated by the average male, the tongue-in-cheek British art-pop band 10cc comprised an all-star roster of Manchester-based musicians. Vocalist/guitarist Graham Gouldman was a former member of The Mockingbirds and the author of hits for The Yardbirds, The Hollies, Herman's Hermits and Jeff Beck; singer/guitarist Eric Stewart was an alumn of Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders; and vocalists/multi-instrumentalists

Kevin Godley and Lol Creme

were both highly regarded studio players. All of them played on eccentric prog folk artist RAMASES' 1971 studio album ""Space Hymns"".

10cc began in 1970 as a session unit dubbed Hotlegs; after establishing residence at Stewart's Strawberry Studios, Hotlegs scored a surprise U.K. smash hit with the single ""Neanderthal Man,"" subsequently issuing an LP, ""Thinks: School Times"", and touring with The Moody Blues.

After signing to Jonathan King's U.K. label and rechristening themselves 10cc (a name suggested by King himself), the group backed Neil Sedaka before recording 1972's ""Donna,"" a sly satire of late-'50s doo-wop. The single reached Number Two on the British charts, establishing not only a long-running string of major hits, but also the quartet's fondness for ironic and affectionate reclamations of musty pop styles. The follow-up, ""Rubber Bullets,"" topped the charts in 1973, and both the subsequent single ""The Dean and I"" and a self-titled debut LP further solidified 10cc as a major force in British pop.

While 1974's ""Sheet Music"" and singles, including the Brian Wilson-esque ""Wall Street Shuffle,"" ""Silly Love"" and ""Life Is a Minestrone"" continued 10cc's dominance of the U.K. charts, they found the American market virtually impenetrable prior to the release of 1975's ""I'm Not in Love,"" which topped the British charts and climbed as high as Number Two in the States. After 1975's ""Original Soundtrack"" and the next year's ""How Dare You!"", Godley and Creme left the band to focus on video production, as well as developing the 'Gizmo', a guitar modification device the duo invented. In the wake of their departure, Gouldman and Stewart continued on alone, enlisting the aid of session men to record 1977's ""Deceptive Bends"", highlighted by the perennial ""The Things We Do for Love.""

After recruiting guitarist Rick Fenn, keyboardist Tony O'Malley and drummer Stuart Tosh as full-time members, 10cc returned in 1978 with ""Bloody Tourists"", which yielded the number one reggae nod ""Dreadlock Holiday."" Following a series of unsuccessful efforts, including 1980's ""Look Hear?"", 1981's ""10 Out of 10"" and 1983's ""Window in the Jungle"", the group disbanded; while Stewart produced Sad Caf� and worked with Paul McCartney, and Gouldman supervised recordings for The Ramones and Gilbert O'Sullivan before joining Andrew Gold in the duo Wax. In 1992, the original lineup of 10cc reunited for the LP ""Meanwhile"", while only Gouldman and Stewart remained for 1993's ""Mirror Mirror""."
f62c,BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO,Italy,Rock Progressivo Italiano,,,artistf62c.html?id=36,,,,,,"Founded in Rome, Italy in 1969 - Between 1997-2018 active playing Live - Reformed in 2016

One of the most important progressive rock bands to come from Italy, BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO, along with LE ORME and PFM are regarded as the big three of the RPI genre. This is not only because of their longevity and the level of success they achieved in their own country, but also because each were able to make considerable inroads abroad, something which didn't happen for most of their contemporaries.

Despite not releasing their first album until 1972, the band actually formed in 1969, their sound centering around the virtuoso dual keyboard work of the Nocenzi brothers, Gianni and Vittorio. The early line-up fluctuated with various members coming and going before any recorded output was released, including drummers Franco Pontecorvi and Mario Achilli, bassist Fabrizio Falco and guitarists Gianfranco Coletta (ex CHETRO & CO) and Claudio Falco. This early incarnation of the band did, however, record some material but this wouldn't surface until 1989 (see the ""Donna Plautilla"" album).

Joining the Nocenzi brothers for a more stable line-up in time for their first album was ex-FIORI DI CAMPO guitarist Marcello Todaro and three members of LE ESPERIENZE, vocalist Francesco Di Giacomo, drummer Pier Luigi Calderoni and bassist Renato D'Angelo. Their eponymous first album was a remarkably mature piece of inventive symphonic progressive rock with classical influences, featuring excellent musicianship and the emotionally charged vocal delivery of Di Giacomo. This was quickly followed up by the equally highly regarded ""Darwin"" and ""Io Sono Nato Libero,"" forming a trio of albums that are essential listening for anyone with even the most casual interest in the RPI genre.

A change of guitarist followed shortly after the recording of ""Io Sono Nato Libero,"" when Todaro left and joined CRYSTALS and was replaced by Rodolfo Maltese, formerly of HOMO SAPIENS. Around this time the band attempted to make inroads outside their native Italy and released the English sung ""Banco"" on ELP'S Manticore label. In reality this was largely a compilation, as it consisted of re-recorded songs from their first three albums with the exception of one track. To promote this they toured the USA and UK with limited success. ""Banco"" was followed in 1976 by the film soundtrack album ""Garofano Rosso,"" and in the same year two versions of the same album, one Italian and one English, ""Come In Un'Ultima Cena"" and ""As In A Last Supper"" were released. 1978 saw the release of another all instrumental album "".Di Terra"", this time incorporating the use of an orchestra.

""Canto Di Primavera"" saw bassist D'Angelo being replaced by Gianni Colaiacomo, and after this the band entered a period that is probably of little interest to prog fans, moving in a more commercial pop direction. In 1983 Gianni Nocenzi was to leave the band, and the following years saw the coming and going of a number of musicians through a series of critically slated albums, at least amongst the prog community.

Signs that the band may be returning to their prog roots came in 1991 when the band re-recorded their acclaimed first album and ""Darwin"". The lightweight pop/rock of ""Banco 13"", released in 1994 showed however that it was a little early to celebrate. No studio albums have appeared since 1996 but the band continued with sporadic live activity and released a number of live albums. Perhaps the most interesting of these is ""Seguendo Le Tracce"", which captures a stunning concert from 1975, reminding us how great this band can be. The most recent of these live albums is ''Quaranta'', a 2010 recording previously released as part of the Prog Exhibition box set. The then line-up comprised of vocalist Francesco Di Giacomo, on keyboards Vittorio Nocenzi, guitarists Rodolfo Maltese and Filippo Marcheggiani, drummer Maurizio Masi, bassist Tiziano Ricci and on sax, flute and clarinet Alessandro Papotto (PERIFERIA DEL MONDO). Sadly, Francesco Di Giacomo died following a road traffic accident on 21st February, 2014.

BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO, particularly the first three albums, is an essential early port of call for anyone looking to discover the RPI genre.

0c98,CAMEL,United Kingdom,Symphonic Prog,,,artist0c98.html?id=50,,,,,,"Formed in 1971  in	Guildford, Surrey, UK - Disbanded in 1984 - Reformed from 1991 to 2003 and again since 2013

The roots of CAMEL go as far as 1964, when the Latimer brothers Andrew and Bryan form part of a band called THE PHANTOM FOUR, after gaining some fame, the band changes their name to STRANGE BREW, a when the bass player Graham Cooper reaches the band. But things were about to change, Ian Latimer and Cooper leave the band and Doug Ferguson joins.

At this point drummer Andrew Ward joins the crew and the seeds  were growing in this new Blues oriented  band called simply THE BREW, and at last in 1971 with the arrival of keyboardist

Peter BARDENS

CAMEL is officially born.

In their first period CAMEL releases four albums, the self titled debut, which was received with limited enthusiasm by the public, which lead to the change of label from MCA (Who didn't wanted to take risks) to Decca, with whom they stayed for 10 years.

Followed by ""Mirage"", Snow Goose"" and ""Moonmadness"" (for many their essential trilogy), during the latest album tour, the saxophonist and flute player Mel Collins joins and leads CAMEL to a first radical change in the sound, as well as in the formation because Doug Ferguson is replaced by the Ex CARAVAN bass player

Richard SINCLAIR

.

With this formation CAMEL releases two albums, ""Rain Dances and ""Breathless"", which marks for many the end of CAMEL'S golden era mainly because Pete Bardens leaves the band and the next release ""I Can See Your House From Here"" is considered inferior to the previous releases by the critic.

From this point the lineups constantly changes but the band still releases seven more albums received with different degrees of acceptance, until the last studio album ""A Nod And a Wink"" sees the light  in 2002 (the same year Pete Bardens passes away) completing a large discography of 14 studio releases, 9 live albums, 7 DVD's and several box sets .

Maybe because their style is softer than most of the pioneer bands with atmospheric and light Space Rock overtones their fanbase is not as huge as the ones of the coetaneous and more aggressive bands such as GENESIS (Who in my opinion influenced CAMEL), YES or KING CRIMSON, but CAMEL is without doubt among the most respected groups, and the Latimer - Bardens duo is considered one of the most creative compositional teams.

If I had to choose one album from their prolific discography, my choice would be ""Moonmadness"" but others such as ""Snow Goose"" or ""Mirage"" are beloved by those who love good music.

An excellent band for people who love the calmed side of Prog.

Formed in 1970 in London, UK- Disbanded in 1980

GENTLE GIANT is known as the paradigmatic progressive rock band. With an uncomparable musicianship, they went as far as no one ever did into unexplored grounds in the progressive music, navigating over dissonant 20th-century classical chamber music, medieval vocal music, jazz and rock. The multi-instrumentation capabilities of the musicians gave such dynamic to their music, which set parameters to a whole coming generation up to these very days. They explored Moogs, Mellotrons and Fender Rhodes usage with such majesty! Not to mention other instruments like oboes, violins, cellos and horns among others.

The band was able to come across the 70's maintaining an outstanding level on their music, altering their style over the years and keeping the quality as only a few bands were able to do. Among their magnificent discography, all the albums from ""Acquiring the Taste"" through ""Playing the Fool"" are essential progressive rock releases (with the possible exception of ""Interview""). This portion of the band's career would see a fittingly grand conclusion on the live ""Playing the Fool"" album. What more is there to say about these masters of progressive music?

dfcd,JEAN-LUC PONTY,France,Jazz Rock/Fusion,,,artistdfcd.html?id=2094,,,,,,"Born  29 September 1942 (Avranches, France)

JEAN-LUC PONTY isn't only a virtuoso violinist but also one of the greatest Fusion composers who blended different genres with great success and a pioneer of the electric violin, his solo works include very different albums as the brilliant and almost symphonic ""Aurora"" or the less inspired Afro Jazz oriented ""Tchokola"", in other words not only a prolific but also a very eclectic and talented Progressive musician.

JEAN-LUC PONTY started his violin studies at the age of five with his father who was Director of the school of music in Avranches and a violin teacher as well, at the age of 13 left school to fully dedicate to the music, later (At the age of 15) was admitted in the Paris Conservatoire graduating two years later with the institution's highest award, Premier Prix.

Being Classical trained, joined CONCERTS LAMOUREUX ORCHESTRA where due to the influence of some friends got interested in Jazz. Incredibly his first works in Jazz were done playing the tenor Saxophone until 1962 when he returned to his first love the violin.

1969 was an important year for the 27 old musician who joins

Frank ZAPPA

for the release of ""Hot Rats"" nd then THE

George DUKE

TRIO for about a year. In  1970 returns to France in order to form The JEAN-LUC PONTY EXPERIENCE until 1972 when comes back to USA to rejoin THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION.

In 1974 he's recruited BY JOHN MCLAUGHLIN'S

MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA

with whom he releases ""Apocalypse"" and ""Visions of Emerald Beyond"" playing a very important role in  both albums.

Even though he made a lot of independent projects before (like ""Jazz Long Playing"" in 1964, ""Sunday"" Walk 1967 or ""The Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio"" in 1969) plus combined efforts with STEPHANE GRAPPELLI and many others

His Progressive solo career starts in December 1975  with the first of four amazing releases, the incredible ""Aurora"" an album in which he blends perfectly not only Jazz and Progressive Rock as most Fusion artists do, but also adds clear touches of Symphonic Progressive mostly echoes from his early and complete Classical formation, a real gem that everybody should have.

During the next three years he completes his essential tetralogy that includes not only the previously mentioned ""Aurora"", but also ""Imaginary Voyage"", ""Enigmatic Ocean"" and ""Cosmic Messenger"", also transcendental for the history of Progressive Rock.

From that point he starts to experiment with Euro Pop, Afro Jazz and even getting pretty close to New Age in some cases, most of this albums are incredibly experimental creating patterns of electronic sounds with the help of sequencers.

Honestly it's hard to understand why this great musician has been forgotten by Prog Archives for such a long time, but I think at last justice is being done with his well-deserved inclusion.

Iv�n Melgar Morey

Why this artist must be listed in www.progarchives.com :

Jean-Luc Ponty deserves to be included not only for his prolific Progressive career, but also because his works with giants of the genre as Frank Zappa and Mahavishnu Orchestra.

If this wasn't enough, he's one of the pioneers of electric violin and probably the first musician to expand the sound his instrument with sequencers.

If this still wasn't enough, he  explored new rhythms and genres like Jazz/Fusion, Afro Jazz, New Age, Electronic Prog, etc.

Just to add one more reason, he gave a chance to musicians that would form part of Progressive Rock bands like Darryl Stuermer (Genesis) and Philippe Catherine (Focus)

IMO this is part of what Progressive Rock is about, to explore and expand the concept of music as an art.

Founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1972 - Disbanded in 1977

This Quebec-based Progressive rock band, who sang in French, has a very apt name in HARMONIUM. The core was a folk trio formed by guitarists

Serge FIORI

and Michel NORMANDEAU, and bassist Louis VALOIS. Their career was short (five years) and they released three studio albums in the mid-Seventies and a posthumous live album. They started off as a jazzy and typically French folk trio but began to delve into more progressive material on their brilliant second album, ""Si on avait besoin d'une cinqui�me saison"" (""If We Needed a Fifth Season""). They are regarded as one of the finest exponents (along with POLLEN and MANEIGE) of the ""Golden Era of Quebec Progressive Music"" Scene.

""Harmonium"" is a ""folky"" album, but it contains progressive elements too. By their 2nd album, they were very much a cross between a symphonic rock band and a folk band; an interesting combination which you can hear most clearly on the 20-minute ""Histoire Sans Paroles"". Overall,  a perfect album to start your French Canadian prog collection. With ""L'Heptade"", they reached their symphonic/progressive zenith. In addition to the now increasingly large band, classical instruments and mellotron are used throughout. This elegant double album is a testament to the potential of the genre. Both are really satisfying; if you are a confirmed proggy-prog band head,to begin with. ""Harmonium en tourn�e"" is an excellent live version of their conceptual work ""L'Heptade"". Fans of brave musical experiments and elegant songwriting could not be disappointed by HARMONIUM...!

ELP revolutionized the 70's rock scene by introducing a new line-up format. This fact really mattered due to each musician's geniality and unlimited talent that, put together, generated a level of music never achieved by anybody else as of yet. All of the musicians came from established bands before joining forces together:

Greg LAKE

came from

KING CRIMSON

,

Carl PALMER

came from

ATOMIC ROOSTER

, and

Keith EMERSON

came from

THE NICE

.

They explored their capabilities to an extreme, even with the technology limitations of the early 70's, breaking ground, setting the new parameters for a new vein in the english pop music (at the time) which would be called progressive music. ELP released 10 outstanding albums during the 70's, and after a long break, they got back in the 90's with a new approach, but still making good music. In 1986

Cozy POWELL

replaced PALMER and they put together EMERSON, LAKE and POWELL, a good effort as well.

They've pushed their ambitions over-the-edge. On ""Tarkus"" the title suite was an inventive and edgy suite revolving around jazzy textures. Their most popular album ""Brain Salad Surgery"", was their most grandiose and refined. Next, the more adventurous listener might try ""Trilogy"" or ELP's self-titled first album. In my opinion, these four albums form the core of ELP's best material. Other good ELP albums include ""Pictures at an Exhibition"", their provocative, fiery and intense take on a classical work. and ""Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends"", a triple-live album (now on double-CD) with some absolutely stunning playing.

2016 was a sad year for Prog fans, because Keith and Greg left us, Rest in Peace and thank you for everything

Being that some albums belong to a different band with only two members of ELP, we have to make this addition:

Emerson, Lake & Powell

(Active between 1985-1986)

Emerson, Lake & Powell, often abbreviated to ELPowell, were an offshoot of a classic prog band Emerson, Lake & Palmer with Cozy Powell taking over the drumming duites in place of Carl Palmer which released one self-titled album in 1986.

After releasing Love Beach in 1978 Emerson, Lake & Palmer became silent for a couple of years until Emerson and Lake met during summer 1985 inspired by Jim Lewis, a vice-president of Polydor Records, and discussed a joint project. Since Carl Palmer was still contracted to Asia and was unable to participate they had to find a substitute and after auditioning several drummers they eventually chose a long time Emerson's friend Cozy Powell. The band have always insisted that it was a coincidence that his surname also happened to start with a P, thus allowing the band to keep its original initials.

Emerson Lake & Powell released their debut LP in 1986 and began rehearsing in England for a US tour. The band's sole album was reminiscent of ELP style, with long suites, mellow ballads and a classical theme (Mars, the Bringer of War by Gustav Holst). Studio outtakes, demos and rehearsals that didn't make it to the official studio album were offered as a mail-order, limited-edition vinyl album, titled Space Gospel, to members of the EMERSON LAKE AND POWELL FAN CLUB.  Most ordered copies of this were never delivered though, due to the bankruptcy of the fulfillment house used by ELP.

The US tour began in El Paso, Texas on August 15 and continued until October 30th. The tour was difficult and marred by a dispute which led to the band firing its management. Shortly after it ended the band disbanded without recording a second album.

Some ELPowell studio rehearsals and live recordings were made available as bootlegs in the 1990s. The material was subsequently remastered and given an official release on two 2003 CDs, available via the ELP website: The Sprocket Sessions (rehearsal tapes) (2003), Live in Concert (recorded live in Lakeland, Florida, November 1986) (2003).

d5b4,LE ORME,Italy,Rock Progressivo Italiano,,,artistd5b4.html?id=278,,,,,,"Founded in  Marghera, Venice, Italy in 1966 - Hiatus from 1982-1986 - Still active as of 2019

Excellent early-70's Italian progressive trio (still around today) with classical stylings, featuring keyboards to the fore and a unique dreamy/powerful style. Le ORME was one of the three major Italian groups, the other two being PFM and BANCO. This band is usually considered as the Italian EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER and even BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO by the Italian singing. Its music is based upon organ developments and soli reminding Seventies groups which works are essentially built upon keyboards parts.

The band's truly classic period begins with their third next releases. ""Uomo Di Pezza"" (1972) is one of Le Orme's definitive Italian progressive rock albums. Although there is definitely an significant EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER influence here, as in the bombastic Moog and Hammond workouts countered by mellow balladry. It's not quite as integrated a feel as would characterize their next two albums, ""Felona E Sonora"" and ""Contrappunti"", though its fantastic nonetheless, and one of Le ORME's three essential albums. ""Collage"" and especially ""Florian"" offer a music tinged with classical music. ""Felona E Sonora"" (1973) is probably one of my top favorite Italian progressive rock albums. ""Contrappunti"" (1974) is another fantastic Le ORME album, and really the close of their classic trilogy. This album would effectively close out the band's streak of success.

""In Concerto"" is an excellent live album from 1974 with many unreleased tracks. ""Piccola Rapsodia Dell' Ape"" is more recent, an excellent mixing of Progressive and Italian baroque music. ""Collage"" and especially ""Florian"" offer a music tinged with classical music. In 1993 the Japanese progrock label Crime Records released the 2-CD ""Live Orme"" with live-material from '75-'77. A far more captivating document than ""In Concerto"" from '74.

Their story goes on. After ""Piccola Rapsodia Dell' Ape"" (1980), in 1982 the band decides to break up. In 1986 they rejoin only for concerts but in 1990 a further work is issued (""Orme""). In 1992 Tony Pagliuca leaves the band, replaced by Michele Bon. That year they obtain the title of best Live-Act band seen in Italy. They never give up symphonic prog and their further works show it clearly. In spite of the success obtained by their live performances, in 1996 they publish a suite (""Il fiume""). After obtaining a great success at the Los Angeles PROG FEST and at the PROG EAST in Quebec, they commit themselves to the new work which will be finished in 2001 (""Elementi""). This latter, together with ""Il fiume"", will be part of a trilogy completed, in 2004, by ""L'infinito"". The trilogy, a mix of songs and instrumental pieces, tells about the mankind through the 4 elements of the universe. In 2005 they are invited at the NEARFEST concert in Pennsylvania. Their music may well be considered as a continuous commitment in PROG ROCK: over the last 42 years they never gave up their passion. They also tried to convey PROG Rock to the people by participating to song contests such as Festival di Sanremo, a very popular TV music happening in Italy. LE ORME is one of the few foreign bands who have been produced by a British label. The Famous Charisma Label issued ""Felona e Sorona"" in English, lyrics by Peter Hammil, after their tour in England in 1973.

Founded in 1968 - Disbanded in 1971 - Reunited  from 1994 up to 2015

This is one of the pivotal progressive bands that emerged in the second part of the Sixties. Unfortunalety the progressive world was more impressed by The NICE and KING CRIMSON, so in my opinion COLOSSEUM is a bit understimated progrock band. In '68 the founding members were drummer Jon Hiseman, tenor sax-player

Dick HECKSTALL-SMITH

and bass player Tony Reeves, later joined by

Dave GREENSLADE

(keyboards), Dave Clempson (guitar), Chris Farlowe (vocals) and Mark Clark, he replaced Tony Reeves. COLOSSEUM made three studio albums: ""Those Who Are To Die We Salute You"" and ""Valentyne Suite"" (both from '69) and ""Daughter Of Time"" ('70). The music is a progressive mix of several styles (rock, jazz, blues) with lots of sensational solos and captivating interplay. In '71 the band released their highly acclaimed live album ""Colosseum live"", a proove of their great skills on stage but also showing that at some moments the compositions sounded a bit too stretched.

After COLOSSEUM was disbanded in '71, most of these members formed or joined known groups like HUMBLE PIE (Clem Clempson),

ATOMIC ROOSTER

(Chris Farlowe),

GREENSLADE

(Dave Greenslade re-united with Tony Reeves) and

COLOSSEUM II

(founded by Jon Hiseman). In '91 the label Castle Communications released the comprehensive compilation CD entitled ""The Time Machine"".

The second album ""The Valentyne Suite"" is considired as their best. It sounds mature and varied with the epic titletrack as the highlight: it's build up around a mindblowing solo on the Hammond organ by Dave Greenslade and great guitarwork by James Litherland. And if you like brass (I don't!), Dick Heckstall-Smith delivers stunning tenor-saxophone work.

""Space Shanty"" is made up of six ambitious tracks composed almost entirely by Hillage. All four musicians are in fine form but the album is particularly dominated by Hillage's spacey/bluesy guitar and Stewart's effervescent Hammond play. Although much of the material is based on a repetitive verse/chorus/verse cycle and has recurrent musical themes, the band frequently breaks out into extended instrumental freak outs, either soloing or engaging in formidable guitar/organ interplay. This album is a fine sample of early Canterbury/bluesy space rock.

A must-have for Canterbury fans, and not merely for its historical value.

Style, Live reputation, Bootleg Culture, and Conclusion

DREAM THEATER is a progressive metal band formed in 1985 in Boston, Massachusetts by guitarist

John PETRUCCI

, bassist John MYUNG, and drummer Mike PORTNOY. Since the band's conception, they have become one of the most influential post-1970s progressive rock bands as well as ranking as one of the early progenitors of the entire progressive metal genre.

II.                History

A.    Formation and Early Years (1985-1990)

Based in a love of the sophistication of YES, the virtuosity of RUSH, and the heaviness of IRON MAIDEN, DREAM THEATER had a desire to create complex, heavy, and progressive from the very beginning. Guitarist and bassist PETRUCCI and MYUNG grew up together on Long Island, New York. After high school, both received scholarships to the esteemed Berklee University of Music, where they met drummer PORTNOY, who, incidentally, grew up in a nearby area. The trio soon became friends and began making music together and settled upon the name MAJESTY. This name came about when PORTNOY described RUSH's song ""Bastille Day"" as ""majestic"" as they were waiting outside a Rush concert to open. As the band became more ""serious,"" they went out looking for a keyboardist and vocalist. Eventually the band found PORTNOY's high schoolmate

Kevin MOORE

to play keys as well as schoolmate Chris COLLINS to sing in 1986. The new 5-piece recorded a 6 song demo titled simply ""The Majesty Demos"" in 1986 on PORTONY's analog 4-track cassette recorder, making an initial run of 1,000 tapes. The tapes, to the band's surprise sold out relatively quickly, which was aided also by the band's distribution of the tapes to friends, family, local rock and metal magazines.

Only a few months after the release of the band's demo, vocalist Chris COLLINS was fired from the band. Even before this, all four instrumentalists had dropped out of college because they could not balance their hectic schedules and the four musicians, with their constant independent study of music, did not feel music school could teach them much more than they already knew. As an independent band, MAJESTY resorted to playing live as consistently as they could at local New York bars and clubs. The band found a new vocalist, the significantly older and more experienced Charlie DOMINICI, late 1987. With this added stability, the band's tour schedule increased and the band began to develop a small fan base and significant amounts of experience. However, not long after the hiring of DOMICI, the Las Vegas rock band MAJESTY contacted the New York MAJESTY and threatened legal action if they did not change their name. As a young fragile band, the five had no choice but to go on the hunt for a new name. Various names bounced around in their head, ranging from Magus to M1 to Glasser, among others. Eventually PORTNOY's father suggested ""DREAM THEATER,"" a name he got from a small theater he ran in Monterey, California, and the name stuck.

With the threat of legal dissolution behind them, DREAM THEATER began to focus more steadily on playing live and making a name for themselves. This touring paid off, as the small record label Mechanic Records contacted the band late June of 1988. Ecstatic at the prospect of being signed, the band eagerly made a meager contract with the label to release their debut record. The label bought them time at a small studio in Pennsylvania, and the band set to record their debut album in the summer of 1988. After about 3 weeks, the band's debut ""When Dream and Day Unite"" was finished. On March 6, 1989, DREAM THEATER made their official debut into the music world.

As an early progressive metal band in a music scene dominated by punk and hair metal, the album did not sell as well as the band had wanted. Nevertheless, the band initiated a small supporting tour for the album, even after the unsupportive label cut contractual ties to the band after the album's failure. The tour was comprised of five shows, and after the fourth tensions led the band to let DOMINICI go. However, as the fifth show was opening for the popular neo-prog band MARILLION, DOMINICI was allowed to sing one last time.

B.     A New Singer and Success (1990-1993)

The next two years were uneventful for the band. The band auditioned over 200 vocalists, including former FATES WARNING vocalist John ARCH, and near all of them were rejected, save Steve STONE. STONE was debuted in a mid-1990 show, but STONE's embarrassing performance during the show led the band to fire him immediately after the performance. As a last ditch effort, the band summoned Canadian vocalist Kevin LABRIE of the glam metal band WINTER ROSE to audition in January 1991. Amazed by his ability, he was hired immediately after the audition. LABRIE dropped his first name to avoid the confusion of having two Kevins and became

James LABRIE

(James being his middle name). Armed with a new singer, the band began touring around the NYC area yet again as well as perfecting the vocal parts for the new music the band had written during their inactive period.

After being sent a 3-track demo, Atco Records contacted the band and offered a 7 album contract on their label. The band eagerly accepted the offer. The band's sophomore release, the famous ""Images and Words,"" was recorded late fall of 1991 in significantly nicer quarters than Mechanic had provided. The album was released July 7, 1992, and after relentless touring both in the U.S., Europe, and, for the first time, in Japan, the album became a smash hit and is currently registered Gold by the RIAA. This was also largely due to the huge success of the album's second single ""Pull Me Under,"" which not only gained significant radio play but also scored play time on MTV with the song's video.

C.     The Middle Period and Band Turbulence (1994-1998)

Electrified by their success, the band quickly delved back into writing after the conclusion of the tour in 1993. The band rushed into the studio to record material for what would become their third album, ""Awake,"" released October 4, 1994. The album, which was much darker and metallic than their previous two albums, received a slew of controversy from fans and critics. On top of this, long time keyboardist Kevin MOORE announced his departure prior to the album's tour due to creative differences. On top of this, vocalist LABRIE suffered from a bad case of food poisoning while vacationing in Cuba after the release of the album. This tragically ruptured his vocal chords, making it near impossible for him to sing in his prior capabilities.

Faced with such pressing problems, the band rushed many auditions to fill the empty keyboardist position so they could try to kick off their ""Waking up the World"" tour as soon as possible. Among those who auditioned were Jens JOHANSSON, who would go on to join STRATOVARIUS, the band's primary choice, Jordan RUDESS, and formed Berklee schoolmate Derek SHERINIAN. While RUDESS was their main choice, RUDESS declined the offer in favor of a part time gig with the DIXIE DREGS. The band instead chose

Derek SHERINIAN

to fill the spot. SHERINIAN was permanently hired after the tour and the band continued being a band, despite LABRIE's shabby vocal position. The band did, however, go on to release an EP containing their legendary ""epic"" ""A Change of Seasons,"" which was composed in 1989 and sparsely played live from '89 to '95. The 23-minute long song was joined by some live tribute songs the band recorded at a show in London.

After the release of ""A Change of Seasons,"" the band went on a short break. During this time, the band's label EastWest went through a number of changes, which included the firing of the band's main contact. When the band returned to the studio in 1997, their new producer expected the band to make a commercially accessible album. The band, who had written enough material for a double album, had planned on something entirely different. After a long and stressful studio session, the band's fifth studio album, ""Falling Into Infinity,"" was released September 23, 1997.  The album's heavier emphasis on accessibility and, to some, ""un""progressive rock and metal, made the album generally unpopular amongst fans and critics. Shaken, the band teetered on the edge of dissolution.

After the tour of the album, the band went on a short hiatus to focus on the various solo and side projects all five members had started. Mike PORTNOY formed LIQUID TENSION EXPERIMENT with John PETRUCCI, keyboardist Jordan RUDESS, and bassist Tony LEVIN (of KING CRIMSON and Peter GABRIEL fame), James LABRIE formed his solo/side project MULLMUZZLER, Derek SHERINIAN and John MYUNG formed PLATYPUS with guitarist Ty TABOR (of KING'S X fame) and Rod MORGENSTEIN (of DIXIE DREGS fame), Mike PORTNOY also began to sow the seeds of what would become TRANSATLANTIC with vocalist and keyboardist Neal MORSE, John PETRUCCI, Derek SHERINIAN, and James LABRIE all contributed to vocalist and keyboardist Trent GARDNER's project EXPLORERS CLUB, and various other projects were formed or collaborated on by DREAM THEATER's members.

D.    Jordan Rudess and The New Millennium (1999-2006)

PORTNOY and PETRUCCI's experiences with keyboard ""wizard""

Jordan RUDESS

solidified their belief that he was the best keyboardist for their sound, and RUDESS finally agreed to play with the band after this as well. Before they began work on their sixth studio album, the band told SHERINIAN that he was being cut from the band. The band and SHERINIAN have remained on good terms since.

With a new keyboardist and a creative spirit in mind, the band went back to the studio in early 1999. The label had given the band complete creative control, so the band planned on pouring all they had into the album. Similar to the spirit in which PORTNOY, PETRUCCI, and RUDESS had created the LIQUID TENSION EXPERIMENT albums, much of the music was composed based on improvising over basic groundwork. The album materialized as their most ambitious work yet - a near 80-minute concept album that acts as the sequel to ""Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper,"" one of the definitive tracks of the band's influential sophomore album. The band's sixth studio album, ""Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory,"" was released October 26, 1999 to very good critical reception. However, despite its positive feedback, it was generally unsuccessful commercially, peaking at #73 on the Billboard 200. Undaunted, the band embarked on their largest and most successful tour yet, which culminated in a recorded show in New York that not only included a massive 4-hour long set list but also on-stage actors that acted out the parts of the concept album, of which the entire album was played live.

The band returned to the studio yet again March of 2001. This session was another ambitious one, as the band had a double album in mind. This album was also to be a concept album, although it was more ""conceptually"" based than ""Metropolis Part 2,"" which was more story based. The album, which precipitated into ""Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence,"" detailed different themes of human struggle. This album was especially notable because the second disc was occupied by one song only, the massive 42-minute epic title track. Despite the dark and experimental nature of the album, the album did very well commercially and is well regarded by fans.

If ""Six Degrees."" was dark, the band's seventh studio album, ""Train of Thought,"" was heavy. The band returned to the studio quickly after the close of the supporting tour of ""Six Degrees."" in March of 2003. The music from those sessions proved to be their heaviest and most metallic yet, taking much influence from Metallica's heavier era. The album was released November 11, 2003 to mixed critical response. The heavy emphasis on metal was a stark contrast to the symphonic nature of the previous album, which alienated some fans. Nevertheless the band embarked on another ambitious international tour with another DVD recorded at the famous Budokan hall in Tokyo.

After the tour, the band returned to the studio late 2004. After a lengthy time recording, the band released their eighth album, ""Octavarium,"" on June 7, 2005. The album's mix of symphonic elements as well as metal elements was popular among most fans. The album did very well international, peaking in the top 5 on many countries' chart. The album was also conceptual, based around the musical octave, the metre of 5/8, and a continuum. Being released in 2005, the resulting supporting tour doubled as the band's 20th anniversary tour. The massive tour also ended in the recording of a DVD at the famous Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

E.     The Roadrunner Years and the departure of Mike Portnoy (2007- )

After taking the summer off, DREAM THEATER returned to the studio again September 2006. The band had recently signed with legendary metal label Roadrunner Records and was eager to create a new album. By mid-2007, the band's ninth studio album, ""Systematic Chaos,"" was ready for release on June 4, 2007. The album, which mixed a more ""standard"" metal sound with a heavily progressive metal sound, met generally positive reviews from critics as well as a good commercial outcome. This album also resulted in a massive world tour, this album in particular featuring a ""double pronged"" tour - the direct supporting ""Chaos in Motion"" tour in 2007 and the ""Progressive Nation 2008"" tour, featuring OPETH, BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, and 3 in 2008.

Expectedly DREAM THEATER returned again to the studio in October of 2008. ""Black Clouds & Silver Linings"" was released on June 23, 2009 and, to no surprise, the band embarked on a world tour in support of the album. The second Progressive Nation tour, aptly titled Progressive Nation 2009, was also launched after this album, and DREAM THEATER was supported by ZAPPA PLAYS ZAPPA, SCALE THE SUMMIT, and BIGELF. DREAM THEATER also announced they would be the official starting act of IRON MAIDEN's Final Frontier world tour in 2010.

These tours, however, would be founding drummer Mike PORTNOY's last with DREAM THEATER. In a shocking message to all of the band's fans, PORTNOY announced he was leaving his band on September 8, 2010. This sparked a heated controversy amongst fans and the band, as PORTNOY had recently recorded metalcore band AVENGED SEVENFOLD's new album after their drummer THE REV died and had toured with the band as well, and many fans believed this ""foreign contact"" had alienated PORTNOY from DREAM THEATER's usual routine. However, PORTNOY's official statements (of which there were quite a few) stated that he had left because he ""the DT machine was starting to burn [him] out"" and ""[he] really need[ed] a break."" Reportedly the band did not agree with PORTNOY's sentiment of taking a hiatus and wanted to continue writing and touring as they had for so many years before. So, PORTNOY, easily the most influential member of the band, left DREAM THEATER.

Of course, as the band planned on re-entering the studio in January of 2011, auditions for a new drummer were to commence immediately, and they did in October of 2010. But, even months after the auditions seemed to have finished, the band sustained air of complete ambiguity about the subject. Even when the news of the album being finished written and tracking had begun the new drummer's name was still unknown. PETRUCCI had said on his forum that seven ""world class"" drummers had been auditioned and the band was ""busting at the seams"" to make the announcement. However, April 2011 rolled around and DREAM THEATER announced the names of the seven drummers: Mike MANGINI (known for session work, Steve VAI, EXTREME, as well as James LABRIE's solo work), Virgil DONATI (known for session work and former DREAM THEATER keyboardist Derek SHERINIAN's side project PLANET X), Marco MINNEMANN (known for session work), Peter WILDOER (known for DARKANE and James LABRIE's solo work), Thomas LANG (known for session work), Derek RODDY (known for session work and various bands), and Aquiles PRIESTER (known for HANGAR and ANGRA). After releasing a small documentary series of the auditions, Mike MANGINI was announced as DREAM THEATER's new drummer to positive buzz from fans. Around the same time the band also released the first single off their eleventh studio album, titled ""A Dramatic Turn of Events"" which was released September 13, 2011 to an overall positive critical reaction.

The band returned to the stage for a lengthy tour of this album which lasted nearly two years. Without skipping a beat, however, the band returned to the studio to begin work on their 12th offering, this time with the aid of Mangini for composition. Within some months of they arriving at Cove City Studios with renowned engineer Richard Chycki, they announced their next album, which was to be self-titled.. The band designed this recording to be organic - as soon as they arrived, the microphones were recording. On September 23, 2013, the album was released to great critical and fan response.

III.                   Style, Live reputation, Bootleg Culture, and Conclusion

DREAM THEATER's musical style has, over their 25+ year career, become synonymous with ""vanilla"" progressive metal. Since their sophomore release, the band's distinctive emphasis on melody, metal, and progressive rock has been the defining factor in near all of their compositions. Each member of the band has won numerous accolades for their instrumental prowess, and the band is in no way shy in showing these talents on albums, as many an instrumental section has an awe-inspiring display of instrumental gymnastics greet the listener. Away from technical ability, the band also has a number of ""ballads"" in their discography, which has become a staple on every DREAM THEATER release. Overall in nearly every progressive metal band, at the very least a small influence of DREAM THEATER can be found, so it is not hard to discover what the DREAM THEATER ""sound"" is.

As a live act, DREAM THEATER have also made quite a name for themselves. As can be seen through their numerous live releases, the band seems to have an addiction to touring, and over the years they have gotten very good at it. While they have for the most part abandoned their ""A Night with."" format where the attendee can experience up to a blistering four hours of live DREAM THEATER, the band continually puts on an energetic and impressive show, displaying their musical ability and quality showmanship across the globe.

On top of their studio and live releases, DREAM THEATER, or more especially former drummer Mike PORTNOY, has a certain affection to releasing ""official"" bootleg material. PORTNOY's independent label YtseJam Records has been releasing bootlegs of DREAM THEATER and DT-related projects for over 10 years, including the likes of ""The Majesty Demos,"" ""The Falling Into Infinity Demos,"" numerous Christmas albums, as well as a number of official unofficial live recordings, one of which is the 15th anniversary show for ""When Dream and Day Unite,"" which features the return of former vocalist Charlie DOMINICI as well as former keyboardist Derek SHERINIAN for an epic performance of one of the band's most famous song, ""Metropolis Part 1"". Among other things, the label has released bootlegs of covers the band has done, early demos of nearly all of the band's studio albums, and other fan club albums.

It goes without saying that DREAM THEATER has become one of the most successful and influential bands in the modern progressive rock and metal scene. On top of influencing countless bands in the progressive metal genre, DT's success is unmatched by the vast majority of progressive bands of today and provides a fantastic model for new bands.
