# New Visualization Proposals for AlbumExplore

## Overview
This document outlines new visualization approaches to replace the removed network view. The network view was removed due to performance issues with 17,316+ albums - force-directed layouts simply don't scale well with that amount of data.

## Proposed New Visualizations

### 0. 🔗 Album Similarity View (NEW - High Priority)

**Description**: An interactive view for exploring albums similar to a selected album based on shared tags, genre, and other attributes.

**Status**: ✅ **DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE** - See [ALBUM_SIMILARITY_VISUALIZATION.md](ALBUM_SIMILARITY_VISUALIZATION.md)

**Key Features**:
- **Focus Album Approach**: Select one album to see its most similar albums
- **Bar Chart Display**: Horizontal bars showing top N similar albums sorted by score
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines tag similarity, genre match, year proximity, and more
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click any album to re-center and explore its similarities
- **Performance Optimized**: < 200ms for 17k+ album database

**Why This Matters**:
- **Discovery**: Help users find albums they might like
- **Exploration**: Navigate the collection by similarity relationships
- **Context**: Understand how albums relate to each other
- **Scalable**: Works efficiently with large datasets

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Map Library Choice**: Folium vs Plotly vs PyQtWebEngine with Leaflet?
2. **Geocoding**: Use external API (Google/OpenStreetMap) or local database?
3. **Caching Strategy**: File-based cache vs database tables?
4. **Album Art**: Where to source high-quality cover images?
5. **Export Formats**: What formats are most useful for users?
